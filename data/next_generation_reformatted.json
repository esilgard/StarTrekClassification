like us to be friends\nuseful how commander\ngold would be lovely with this i am sure commander there are reasons for a first officer to want to demonstrate his energy and alertness to a new captain but since my duty and interests are outside the command structure\nthank you ill take the entire bolt send it to our starship when it arrives charge to doctor crusher\ni was accusing you of inventing work in order to curry favour with our new captain i apologise\nmaybe this is something jean luc would like looked into\nyes wes long long ago a pleasure to meet you commander you will excuse

intriguing captain very very accurate\nat least we are acquainted with the judge captain\nif i may captain objection your honour in the year 2036 the new united nations declared that no earth citizen could be made to answer for the crimes of his race or for bears q\nuncertain when he froze lieutenant torres on the bridge we had our sickbay to help thaw him out\nyes sir the captain had asked the question can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial and in reply the judge stated yes absolutely equitable q\nwhat is present course conn\nconfirm we are on that heading sir\naye sir into the standard parking orbit\nmessage from the saucer module sir it will arrive herein fifty one minutes\nthe saucer module is now entering orbit with us sir\nthey say you will be doing this manually sir no automation\nsir\nsorry sir if that subject troubles you\none hundred thirty seven years admiral according to starfleet records\ni remember every fact i am exposed to sir\nno siri man android\ni thought it was generally accepted sir that vulcans are an advanced and most honourable race\nyes sir\ni will sir\nmarvellous how easily humans do that i still need much practice\nis hall endeavour to function adequately sir\nyes sir a wise procedure sir always\nno sir starfleet class of 78 honours in probability mechanics and exobiology\nmachine correct sir does that trouble you\nunderstood sir prejudice is very human\ni am superior sir in many ways but i would gladly give it up to be human\nah intriguing\nthis woodland pattern is quite popular sir perhaps because it duplicates earth so well coming here almost makes me feel human myself\nmuch of it is real sir if the transporters can convert our bodies to an energy beam then back to the original pattern again\ncorrect sir the rear wall\nwere right next to it\ni cant see as well as geordi sir but so far the material seems rather very ordinary\nconstruction records show this to be almost identical to that which starfleet uses\ncommander something down here is shielding our communicators\nnegative but something similar\nare you undamaged\nall systems operating\nunlikely sir our records show that you supervised all band i contact with other worlds\nmost interesting sir\nbut no sound of power no equipment\nmost intriguing again sir the place that this vessel was firing upon was not the farpoint starbase but the home of those who constructed sorry siri seem to be commenting on everything\nand firing not on the new space station but on the bandi and their city\nready for departure sir\nthis way sir you must be new to these galaxy class starships sir tell me the location of commander data\nand as you see sir its pointing you that way\nyour e welcome sir\nsir the enterprise is arriving\ni dont know sir captain picard has signalled for you to beam up immediately\naye sir\nis a remarkable piece of bio electronic engineering by which i quote see much of the em spectrum ranging from simple heat and infrared through radio waves etcetera etcetera and forgive me i five said and listened to this a thousand times before\ni was born this way\nthey say its because i use my natural sensors in different ways\nwhich would affect how this works no choice number two\nsame difference no thank you doctor\nsee you\nbut these tunnel walls are something ive never seen before sir\nin every way\nmicroscopically thermally electromagnetically none of it is familiar riker\nwell its of no material i recognise sir or have even heard of\nat this point it becomes ordinary stone sir matching whats above\nhold it right there boy\nwhat about my age\ntroubles me whats so damned troubling about not having died how old do you think i am\nexplain how you remember that so exactly\ni dont see any points on your ears boy but you sound like a vulcan\nalmost as bad\nthey are they are and damned annoying at times\nwell this is a new ship but she s got the right name now you remember that you hear\nyou treat her like a lady and shell always bring you home\nall forward motion stopped sir\nits what its been all along sir direct heading to farpoint station\nknow anything about farpoint station sir sounds like a fairly dull place\nyou will agree data that starfleet s orders are difficult\nas simple as that\nits hardly simple data to negotiate a friendly agreement for starfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around finding how and why the lifeform the rebuilt it\ndata how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia of human information without knowing a simple word like snoop\nit means to spy to sneak\nexactly yes\nshut off that damned noise goto yellow alert\nreverse power full stop\nthats quite a directive would you mind identifying what you are q\ndata call medics\nhe would not have injured you do you recognise this the stun setting q\nwhat that nonsense is centuries behind us q\nmost certainly i deny it i agree we still were when human swore costumes like that four hundred years ago q\nbut even when we wore costumes like that wed already started to make rapid progress q\nno the same old story is the one were meeting now self righteous life forms who are eager not to learn but to prosecute to judge anything they dont understand or cant tolerate q\nweve no fear of what the true facts about us will reveal q\nsense anything commander\nfrom this point no station aboard repeat no station for any reason will make use of transmitted signals or intercom well try and take them by surprise lets see what this galaxy class starship can do lieutenant inform engine room to prepare for maximum acceleration\nrecords search data results of detaching saucer section at high warp velocity\nsearch theoretical\nusing print out only notifyall decks to prepare for maximum acceleration now hear this maximum your e entitled to know means that well be pushing our engines well beyond safety limits our hope is to surprise whatever that is out there try and outrun i tour only other option is to tuck tail between our legs and return to earth as they demand\nstandby engage\nsteady on that\ncontinue accelerating counsellor at this point im open to guesses about what weve just met\nbeyond\nare you sure\nreverse angle\nworf inform the engine room we need more\ngoto yellow alert arm aft photon torpedoes place them on ready status\nnow hear this printout message urgent all stations on all decks prepare for emergency saucers ever you will command the saucer section lieutenant\nyou area starfleet officer lieutenant\nmake the mark data note in ships log that at this startime im transferring command to the battle bridge captains log stardate 411537 preparing to detach saucer section so that families and the majority of the ships company can seek relative safety while the vessels star drive containing the battle bridge and main armaments will turn back and confront the mystery that is threatening us\nlieutenant your torpedoes must detonate close enough to the hostile to blind it at the moment we separate\nworf this is the captain\nat the moment of separation we will reverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead and clear of us\nbegin countdown mark\nlets come to a stop reverse power\ndead stop well hold this position and wait for them\nlieutenant are you recommending we fight a life form that can do all those things id like to hear your advice\nthank you conn commander signal the following in all languages and on all frequencies we surrender state that we are not asking for any terms or conditions\nmid twenty first century the post atomic horror\nbut these courts happened in the past\ncan we assume you mean this will be a fair trial q\ntasha no\nyou ve got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can torture us or frighten us into silence will she live\nor what or this her death or worse you promised the prisoners will not be harmed we plead nothing so long as you break your own rules q\ni suggest you are now having second thoughts it you are considering that if you conduct a fair trial which was your promise you may lose q\nyes even though your e judge and prosecutor q\naccepted so long as you keep to your agreement and assaulting prisoners is hardly a fair trial q\ncourt of fact we humans know our past even when were ashamed of iti recognise this court system as the one that agreed with that line from shakespeare kill all the lawyers q\nwhich led to the rule guilty until proven innocent q\ngrievously savage could mean anything i will answer only specific charges q\ni see no charges against us your honour q\nguilty provisionally q\nwe question whether this court is abiding by its own trial instructions have i have permission to have commander data repeat the record q\nthese will be your own words your honour what exactly what followed his honours statement that the prisoner will not be harmed\nalright we agree there is evidence to support the courts contention that humans have been savage therefore i say test us test whether this is presently true of humans q\nthere must be many ways we can be tested we have a long mission ahead of us q\nweve heard that we may find it rather interesting personal log commander william rikerstardate411537 the hood has dropped me off at farpoint station where i await the arrival of the new uss enterprise to which i have been assigned as first officer meanwhile i have been asked to visit the farpoint administrators office in the old city\ndo we have clearance\nmake it so\nis the viewer ready\nwell first bring you uptodate on a little adventure we had on our way here commander then well talk welcome aboard\ninform them well connect as soon as they arrive and sent the commander to me when he s finished\ncome\nit seems were alive only because we have been placed on probation a very serious kind of probation go\nacknowledged commander riker will conduct a manual docking picard out\nyouve reported in havent you you are qualified\nthen i mean now commander\na fairly routine manoeuvre but you handled it quite well\ni do have some questions for you though riker\ni see in your file that captain desoto thinks very highly of you one curious thing however you refused to let him beam down to altair three\ni see a captains rank means nothing to you\nisnt it just possible that you dont get to be a starfleet captain without knowing whether its safe to be am down or not isnt it a little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captains judgment\nalways\nand you dont intend to back off that position\none further thing a special favour\nusing the same kind of strength you showed with captain desoto i would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself with children\nim not a family man riker and yet starfleet has given me a ship with children aboard\nand i dont feel comfortable with children but since a captain needs an image of geniality youre to see thats what i project\nwelcome to the enterprise commander riker\ndid you signal the hood commander riker\nwhat was my answer computer q\nlieutenant do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer if the purpose of this is to test humans your honour we must proceed in our own way q\nbut futilely\nof course you will weve along voyage ahead of us\nwe do exactly what we would do if this q never existed if were going to be damned lets be damned for what we really are\npersonal log stardate 411538 of the twenty four hours q allotted us to prove ourselves eleven have now passed without incident and yet i can not forget qs prediction that we will face some critical test\nand its your belief that this is what made it possible for them to construct this base to starfleet standards\nperhaps its like those incidents you describe in your report as almost magical attempts to please us\nnone of it suggests anything threatening if only every life form had as much desire to please ready to be am down im looking forward to meeting this gropp ler zorn\nas if its something q is doing to trick us over here ive asked the counsellor to join us in this meeting may i introduce our new first officer commander william riker commander riker this is our ships counsellor deanna troi\nhave the two of you met before\nexcellent i consider it important for my key officers know each others abilities\nmy crew and i need a bit more information before we make our recommendations to starfleet\ngood since we admire what weve seen of your construction techniques starfleet may be interested in your constructing star bases elsewhere also\ncounsellor what is it\nyes no secrets here if were to be all to be friends agreed gropp ler\nthe source of this gropp ler do you have any idea\nand that sit no other comment\nwhile evading even our simplest questions about it well adjourn for now while we all reconsider our positions\nfine i hope they find you as tasty as they did their past associates\nvery good commander\ngood idea\nchildren are not allowed on the bridge\ndoctor crusher\nyour son\nwell as long ashes here i knew your father wesley want a look around\nbut dont touch

orbit with us\ndo you know who it is\ni asked if you knew who it is you mentioned the ferengi alliance to me\nare you certain\nsensor scans mister worf\nbring photon torpedoes to ready\ntune that down commander riker come in can you hear me\ncommander riker come in where are you\nand farpoint station any damage there\nits from an unidentified vessel thats entered into orbit with us here\nno id no answer to our signals\nunderstand commander\nwould you object to your captain ordering a clearly illegal kidnapping\ngropp ler zorn may have the answers we need get him bring him here\ntheyre forcing a difficult decision on me counsellor\nwe are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them lieutenant lock phasers on that vessel\nget off my bridge q\nweve no idea who is on that vessel my order was a routine safety precaution q\ncaptain to cmo\nare you reading any of this\ncompliments on that doctor any questions starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever q\nlets consider your thoughts you call us savages and yet you knew those people down there would be killed it is your conduct that is uncivilised\ngo to manoeuvring jets position us between that vessel and the planet force fields full on\nfrom the same source as before\nthat is enough damnit q\nan agreement which you are at this moment breaking by taking over our vessel interfering with my decisions either leave or finish us q\ndo nothing that he asks q\nill risk none of my crew on that unknown q\nat least you impressed him number one thats hopeful\nill attend to my duty\ni see nothing so bitter about that\ni didnt want you thinking me harsh coldblooded\ni didnt welcome you aboard personally professionally i made you come to me on the bridge i yelled at your son who as you pointed out was quite correct he does seem to have a very good grasp of starship operations\nah but now your assignment here i would consider and approve you a transfer for you\nhardly your service record shows your e just the chief medical officer i want\nim trying to be considerate of your feelings doctor for you to work with a commanding officer who would continually remind you of a terrible personal tragedy\nyou requested this posting\nah then welcome aboard doctor\nieri hope we can be friends\ntransporter chief yank them back now riker acknowledge q\ntransporter chief do you have their coordinates transporter chief q\ntransporter chief come in ive people in trouble over there q\neveryone at ease that san order q my people are in trouble let me help them please ill do whatever you say q\nit seems i did make that bargain\nno do nothing he demands\nwas there a reason q\nif you d earned that uniform your e wearing you d know that the unknown is what brings us out here q\nlets test that beginning with the tunnels you have under farpoint gropp ler\nin return for some pain you d given other creature\nthank you that was the missing part lieutenant yar rig main phaser banks to deliver an energy beam\nand into specific patterns of matter just as our transporters do\ngropp ler you captured something like that didnt you\ntransmit the message leave farpoint space station immediately\nattacking those who had captured capture its mate\nlock it in on farpoint station q\nlet it have whatever it can absorb energise\ndiscontinue gropp ler zorn there ll soon be no farpoint station if im right about this q\nwhich your world furnishes you in plenty\nonly enough to keep it alive so that you could force it to shape itself into whatever form you needed\nwhy do you use other life forms for recreation q\nleave us weve passed your little test q\nget off my ship q\nall stations\nsome problem riker\noh no number one im sure most will be much more interesting lets see what s

constructing this space station your energy supply must be as abundant as ive heard\nthank you but it still seems incredible to me that you could have constructed this station so rapidly and so so perfectly suited to our needs\nif there san apple\nit doesnt matter what i was saying was ill be damned\ngropp leri could have sworn it was n there a minute ago\nnot at all gropp ler\nand its delicious thank you good morning gropp ler zorn\ndoctor crusher\nhello wes enjoying farpoint station\ni saw you i thought i might join you for a stroll\nive been meaning to visit them all myself\nim willing doctor although were not officially part of the enterprise i thought there might be something useful we can do while we wait\ninvestigating some things that ive noticed since ive been here the last was a piece of fruit\nisnt it remarkable they happen to have exactly what you asked for\nlets see where were we\njean luc picard you know the captain\nmy pleasure doctor wes\nsee you onboard\nis this an official report lieutenant laforge\nstar drive section only what happened\nour new captain doesnt waste time its a good idea thank you lieutenant\nenterprise this is commander riker at farpoint station standing by to beam up\nwith the saucer gone i assume something interesting happened on your way here\nriker wt reporting as ordered sir\nhe calls that a little adventure\nnot exactly a run of the mill happening captain\nsir\nyes sir\nas ordered\nvelocity to one half metre per second adjust pitch angle negative three degrees watch your roll angle connall stations prepare for reconnection thrusters to station keeping all velocity zero her inertia should do the job now lock up now\nthank you sir i hope i showed some promise\nin my opinion sir altair three was too dangerous to risk exposing the captain\nrather the reverse sir but a captains life means a great deal to me\npermission to speak candidly sir\nhaving been a first officer yourself you know that assuming that responsibility must by definition include the safety of the captain i have no problem with following any rules you lay down short of compromising your safety\nno sir\nanything sir\nsir\nyes sir\naye sir\nwhere willi find commander data\nan admiral\nwhy a shuttlecraft why wouldnt he just beam over\nyour exact message bon voyage mon ami\nyou reacted fast mister worf\nwhat do we do now captain with them monitoring our every move and every word\nthis planets interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal energy sir but its about all this world does offer\nyes sir we have to assume that they ve been trading their surplus energy for the construction materials used here according to our ships scans many of the materials used are not found on this world\nthose events did happen sir\ni have a feeling theres more to it than just pleasing us sir\nlikewise counsellor\nwe have sir\nif i may captain then a trade gropp ler some things you need in return for lending us architects and engineers who can demonstrate your techniques\nensign can you help me find commander data i understand hes somewhere on this deck\nthank you\nthank you\ni do\nhello\nthere are some puzzles down on the planet that the captain wants answered he suggests that i take you with me on the away team that ill be leading\nyes when the captain suggested you i looked up your record\nthen your rank of lieutenant commander is honorary\nyour file says that your e an\nto be honest yes a little\nnow that does trouble me do you consider yourself superior to us\nnice to meet you pinocchio a joke\nyour e going to be an interesting companion mister data\ni didnt believe these simulations could be this real\nyes of course and these rocks and vegetation have much simpler patterns\ni cant see it\nincredible\ncareful the next rock is loose\nwesley\nmister data has agreed to join me on the away team captain\ntasha you and the counsellor and geordi i want your eyes down there you and i will start with topside\nhave you noticed anything unusual\nconstruction records\nhow are you examining them\nim sorry counsellor but you must we need more information\nhang on im coming enterprise lock us onto her signal\nim sorry close your mind to the pain\nwho\nwhat in the hell kind of place is this geordi what do you see\ntroi you ve been at it enough\ncome on lets get to the surface\nyou tasha and geordi will be am up to the ship now come on i want to see exactly what s happening\nyou have your orders lieutenant carry them out\nriker to enterprise come in\nwith data on the edge of the old city sir its being hit hard sir\nnegative on damage to farpoint sir whoever they are it seems theyre carefully avoiding hitting the station\nthe old band i city s being hit hard sir many casualties very probable\nno objection sir\naye sir\nyes you\ndrive who away gropp ler\nthen if we can learn nothing from you well leave\nfirst officer to enterprise weve lost zorn something like a transporter beam seems to have snatched him away\nquestion sir could it be this qq\nwith all respect captain i want to beam over there q\nhave you understood any part of what he s tried to tell you humanity is no longer a savage race q\nthank you captain captain if he s not open to evidence in our favour where will you go from there\nto the bitter end\nriker to picard were ready to beam over sir\nphasers on stun energise\nwhat is it troi is it the same as you felt down there\ngood dont stop my friend\nenterprise riker this is turning out to be a very long tunnel or corridor sir\nno ships crew insight no sign of mechanism or circuitry no controls or readouts this is nothing like any vessel ive seen before\nzorn can you hear me\nit was that which sent us back captain\nidentical to the ones on the space vessel life form over there why was it punishing you gropp ler\nyour e right captain it has to be conceivable that somewhere in this galaxy there could exist creatures able to convert energy into matter\njust hoping this isnt the usual way our missions will go sir\nships sensors have detected the presence of a vessel approaching this planet no ship is scheduled to arrive at this time sir\nthe vessel does not match the hoods configuration or id signal\nit measures twelve times our volume captain\nstill no response sir weve done everything but threaten them\nget to your feet

thought sir we should look for some way to distract them from going after the saucer\ni must because i grew up on a world that allowed things like this court and it was people like these that saved me from it this so called court should get down on its knees to what starfleet is what it represents\nlieutenant yar of security sir captain picard will see you on the battle bridge\nbattle bridge thats for the captain to explain sir\ncommander riker sir\nall setup sir\nthis ways irq\nyes sir q\nrecommend that someone could begin by examining the underside of the station sir\nteam leader\nweve found something interesting were in a passageway directly under the station sir\npain again\nmy god was that a phaser blast\nphasers locked on captain q\nstanding by on phasers captain q\nits much the same

advanced sir or certainly very very different\nall decks acknowledging sir\nthat will bring them herein just minutes sir\naye sir all language forms and frequencies\ncareful sir this is not an

do\ni too would never say goodbye imz adi\ni can sense only strong emotions gropp leri am only half beta zoid my father was a starfleet officer\ndo you want it described here sir\npain pain loneliness terrible loneliness despair im not sensing the gropp ler sir or any of his people but its something very close to us here\nour sensors do show some passages sir perhaps you and i\nsir ive avoided opening my mind whatever i felt in the gropp lers office became very uncomfortable\npain such pain pain\nunhappiness terrible despair\ni dont know no lifeform anything like us\nnoi feel close to an answer of some kind\nyes thats exactly the feeling ive been reading as if someone doesnt want us to be in touch with our ship\nthose stairs are where we entered down here sir\ndont if you should be hurt\nyes sir im sorry sir enterprise three to beam up\nbut i doubt protecting the band i would violate the prime directive true they are not actual allies but\ncaptain suddenly im sensing something else satisfaction enormous satisfaction\nno that was on the planet this is much closer q\nno this is much more powerful full of anger hate\nno its directed down toward the old band i city\ngropp ler zorn sir a great fear just ahead\ntheres a different feeling here than in the tunnel very different\nhas the alien communicated\nthats it sir its just one alien that im sensing here\nnot true he does know\nthe agreement isnt valid sir it wasnt q that saved us q\nyes sir it is not merely a vessel sir somehow it is alive q\nthen it was a pair of creatures i was sensing one down there in grief and pain the other up here filled with anger\nsir wonderful a feeling of great joy and gratitude great joy and gratitude from both of them\nyou will agree data that starfleet s orders are difficult\nah commander riker i thought you d want to know weve still no word from your vessel i trust we made your waiting comfortable\nmother its commander riker\nyes sir\nif youre wondering about mom commander riker shes not unfriendly shes just shy around mens he doesnt know\nmom that gold pattern wasnt there\nwhen i was little he brought my fathers body home to us\nsir\nyes sir\ncommander riker\ncommander riker isnt this great this is one of the simpler patterns they ve got thousands more some you just cant believe\nwow\nsir may be i should get something to wipe this water up\ntheresa low gravity gymnasium too itd be hard to get bored on this ship\nmom could you get me a look at the bridge\nare you afraid of the captain too\nbut captain picard is a pain isn the\njust a look at the bridge ill

bounce off some things happening sir theyre firing on farpoint sir\nwait sir theyre hitting the old band i city not far point station\nsir theyre firing on the planet again\naye sir impulse power to we have no ship control sir its gone\ncaptain\nah commander riker i thought you d want to know weve still no word from your vessel i trust we made your waiting comfortable\ngood good\nanything\ngeothermal energy is the one great blessing of this planet ill have all the details of that sent to your quarters\nwould your care for an earth delicacy commander\nim sorry commander\nah yes there was another selection here\nand did your failure to notice it make it unwelcome\ni trust it will be the same with farpoint station commander a few easily answered questions about it wont make starfleet appreciate it less\ngood morning\nyou have been told not to do that why cant you understand it will arouse their suspicion and if that happens we will have to punish you we will i promise you\nno objections to that but but im puzzled over you bringing a beta zoid to this if her purposes iris to probe my thoughts\nwell i have nothing to hide of course\nwe are not interested in building other facilities\nband i do not enjoy leaving their home world if starfleet can not accept that small weakness then we will be forced unhappily to seek an alliance with someone

reading a history of all the past starships named enterprise\ncaptain i believe weve have the answer to what happened over there\nsimilar conditions they were monitoring a planet that was breaking up

your shoes\nhold on the rei must tell you captain will riker was in for a trim yesterday and he agrees with me a hundred percent\nuh oh thats right along the cardassian border\ni told him we shouldnt colonise so close to the cardassians\ncaptain picardi a morta please forgive my appearance unfortunately some years ago as a guest of the cardassians my face was mutilated my vocal cords were cut\ni am sorry but after speaking with rol are ni decided that it was\ni am not at all interested in peace and i am not convinced you are either ro\nall is not what it seems to be captain perhaps someone is using you to get to me perhaps you are a victim of this deception as well i do not know\nyour mission was to seek out the bajoran terrorists who destroyed the federation settlement on solari on four\nas i have informed rol are n it was not the bajor a\nwell one does not always have the luxury\nyes wherever possible\nwell you know that really does look very nice mister moti think that will be sufficient\nyes\nlay in a new course im on my way\nreport\nhail them on upper and lower band frequencies mister worf\ntime to the solar ion system\ni understand you ve been discussing alternative adversarial engagement strategy with mister mot\nopen a channel\nginger tea with honey eighty degrees celsius\nmy aunt adele s cure for the common cold\ndid he have anything to say about this attack\nbut in forty years theyve never attacked a federation target\nand our response\non many worlds we ve been to they are isolated treated as pariahs\nbut this could be done through diplomatic channels admiral what do you really want of us\nanyway i can\nand what do i have to offer orta that might persuade him to cooperate\nadmiral\nadmiral theyve endured generations of sympathy and promises how can i believe this orta will be satisfied with more of the same\ngo ahead\nnegative\nrol are n from the wellington\nstandby commander\nadmiral respectfully i would appreciate consulting rights on the assignment of a new officer especially one with the record of rol are n\nthere are other bajoran sin starfleet assign one of them\nafter what happened on garon two she has no business serving on any starship let alone the flagship my ship\nits that important to you\npicard to riker\nproceed with the transport\nill fill you in later\ni hope you and i dont regret this admiral\ntheyll have to learn to live with it\ni would expect nothing less it wont be for long will come\nyes ensign laren please have a seat ro\ni beg your pardon ro\nim sorry i didnt know ro\ni wish to be candid with you ensign ro\nim fully aware of your starfleet record your problems on other ships and the incident on garon two that led to your court martial and im concerned about your presence on this delicate mission ro\nnevertheless we will all be serving together commander riker and i have expectations of your o\ndismissed captains log supplemental we are approaching the valo system on the outskirts of cardassian territory where many bajoran shave resettled\nwhat can you tell us about him doctor\nand thats a big advantage on this mission very well mister data will you contact holz a arrange a meeting\nwell lets hope that your e mistaken ensign but can you point us at the right individual as mister data suggested ro\nim pleased you agreed to meet with us mister ke eve\nensign ro has educated me\ndo you know where we can find orta\ncan you help us locate him\nthen i dont understand why you are unwilling\nwe were saddened by those events but they occurred within the designated borders of the cardassian empire\nwell im not here to debate federation policy with you but i can offer you assistance\nweve had our problems with the cardassians too but now that we have a treaty were in a position to help your people have been forced to resettle all over the quadrant but now we can make a legitimate case with the cardassians that this is not an isolated problem we can work diplomatically on your behalf but first these terrorist attacks must end\nmister data see to it that the replicators provide a blanket for every man woman and child before nightfall\nmister worf determine what these people may have in the way of emergency needs and provide for them\nin an age when their technology should be able to clothe and feed all of them that they should have to live like this ro\nany indications of weapons or vessels beneath the surface\nwhich is very likely why they chose this moon for their base of operations\ncaptain picard to ensign ro\nany activity at the meeting site\nprepare to transport us to the same location ensign ro beamed to mister worf phasers\nsee if we can determine their direction standard search pattern\nmister worf you come with me\nit was not necessary to abduct us\nthen she has done us both a disservice i am committed to peace\nwhatever your motives youve already done enough to damage these negotiations ro\nthere will be no bloodshed ro\nthen perhaps you would share them with me ensign\ndeception\nyes\nensign romay i see you in my ready room ro\nyou do not leave this ship without authorisation ro\nthis is not a discussion your e restricted to your quarters for the remainder of this mission dismissed ro\ncome\nensign ro has been confined to her quarters\nguinan i dont know why you are involved in this but\nplease sit down guinan is very selective about whom she calls a friend ro\nwhat can you not do any more ensign ro\ni know that part ro\nwhat kind of incentive ro\ni find that almost impossible to believe that admiral kennelly would consider supplying weapons to the terrorists ro\nyou have been in contact with admiral kennelly during this mission ro\narming these people is a violation of everything that the federation stands for even you can not be blind to that ro\nhave you made this offer to or taro\nthat was a wise choice ensign it probably saved you from another court martial have you briefed admiral kennelly since we returned from the surface ro\nthen we have one thing in common do you think that orta would cooperate with us to determine the truth herero\ngood our orders were to find him to bring him back to the camps any way we could perhaps that is exactly what we should doro\nand then watch what happens captains log supplemental i have become convinced that we are somehow involved in a conspiracy i am hopeful the purpose behind it will be revealed in the next few hours\nit was a team effort admiral ensign row as invaluable\nthe enterprise will escort a bajoran antares class carrier to the valo three camp at oh five hundred hour sorta and his people will be a board\nacknowledged hows that cardassian virus admiral\nim pleased we will report as soon as our mission is accomplished picard out\nmister data keep an eye on the cardassian border\non screen hail them mister worf\nthis is captain picard were prepared to escort you to valo three\nensign roset a course for valo three half impulse ro\ncan you identify the class of these ships mister worf\nyellow alert continue to monitor them\nthats where it will be\nensign roset a course to intercept the cardassians mister worf open a channel to the bajoran vessel\nthis is the enterprise we are moving to intercept two cardassian warships maintain your present course and speed\non screen\nopen a channel mister worf this is captain jean luc picard of the federation starship enterprise how can we help you\nim pleased to hear that gul do lak for all of us in the federation value the peaceful relations with our cardassian neighbours\nwell now that weve established our mutual goodwill whats on your mind\nterrorist carrier are you certain\nrest assured gul do lak there will be no terrorist attacks today we are escorting the bajoran settlers to their camp on valo three you can monitor their course if you wish\nthis is neutral space gul do lak you have no jurisdiction here\nif we withdraw what do you intend to do with the bajoran vessel\ni see that puts me in a difficult position i promised to escort these people to their camps\nim sorry to offend you gul do lak but we can not withdraw\nis that intended as a threat\nadvise starfleet of our status mister data when admiral kennelly calls ill speak to him in my ready room\nit seemed admiral that they knew our course our destination our plan\nim not convinced of that\ndo you have any suggestions admiral\nsiri see no way to protect the cardassian peace without sacrificing the bajoran s\nno im not willing to give them up\nwell i just see a different big picture admiral it looks something like this is ee the cardassian liaison with his cardassian virus coming to meet with you after the attack on solari on four now we have a common enemy he says the bajoran terrorists the cardassians cant find them but maybe the federation can im beginning to see that our mission has in fact been to expose orta so that the cardassians can move in and destroy him\nensign roset a course bearing one eight seven mark one zero two one quarter impulse ro\nhold present course\non screen\nno here on screen\nthe cardassians have destroyed the bajoran ship admiral\nno sir\nno sir no one was on board\nthe ship was controlled from the ground communication was handled through a subspace relay onboard the vessel\nactually no it was ensign ros idea but i fully endorsed iti suspected that something like this might occur\nadmiral i am more concerned with protecting the honour and integrity of starfleet\nthe bajoran s did not attack solari on four\nyes\nadmiral or tas ships are old and obsolete they dont even have warp capabilities they couldnt have reached another star system let alone attacked one\ni would suggest you ask your friend the cardassian liaison admiral the only explanation i can think of is that the cardassians staged it\nperhaps they were hoping to find someone in starfleet like you admiral naive enough to solve their bajoran problem for the mro\nim not sure a hearing certainly probably a court martial ro\nin a few weeks we have some surveying to do insect or two one three oh five ro\nensign you were recruited for one mission and if you wish to be relieved of further duty i can certainly arrange it but id like you to consider remaining in starfleet ro\ni think it would be a shame for starfleet to lose some one of your potential ro\nthat can change ro\nive noticed qualities in you that could be harnessed moulded ro\ni think you ve got a great deal to learn from starfleet ro\nthat

formations may act as an effective barrier\ncommander the refractory metals in the rock strata may also interfere with communication\ni am not entirely certain they will sir\nit has been over an hour since we heard the entity sir it may be gone\ndoctor iran a full spectrographic analysis section by section trace elements confirm that it is the same entity which destroyed the colony at omicron theta\ndoctor the cave in which we hid was made of rock which contained heavy concentrations of kelboniteandfistriumwe surmise that the entity was unable to penetrate that barrier\nyes sir\ndoctor there is evidence of residual bit rious matter in the soil it was not present before the entity s attack\ndoctor doctor marr you have made it clear that my presence disturbs you however i do not see how we can achieve our task if you continue to ignore me\nthen i do not understand your lack of interest in the bit rious filament i mentioned\nas i have speculated the presence of refractory metals\nwere those caves laced with kelboniteorfistrium\nthen perhaps the combination of the two metals prevented the entity from\ni do not understand\ni can not see what effect my being here would have had\ndo you believe that i lured the entity here\nno doctor because lore betrayed the colonists on omicron theta you believe that i am capable of the same behaviour you are mistaken doctor my programming is distinctly different from lores\ni do understand and i am attempting to explain to you it is impossible\nthat is true doctor\nyes doctor\nwere you expecting a different result this time doctor\ndoctor have you ever scanned your samples for gamma radiation\nwe are seeing high energy reactions that may show up in a gamma scan\nif the entity left a residual trace of antiproton in the samples we collected a gamma radiation scan would reveal that\nif we try a logarithmic scale we will have better resolution\nyes doctor\nthe thanks actually go to doctor clen denning on omicron theta who did the first experiments with gamma scans\nthat is correct but i possess much of his knowledge he was working on new detectors at the time of the attack on omicron theta\nit is true doctor the contents of their logs and journals were transferred into my memory cells the man who created me also experimented with scanning the synaptic patterns of the colonists temporal lobe sand programming them into my neural nets\nto some degree doctor soong hoped to provide me with an amalgam of the colonists memories\nyes sir there are two possible destinations the brechtian cluster and the argos system\nyes sir the brechtian cluster has two inhabited planets\ncome in\nnot at all doctor\nthat is very gracious of you to say doctor but i have not been injured by you\nthat is true i have experimented with producing vibrations in crystals by means of graviton pulses\nexactly i will call up the results i have achieved this far for you to study\ni do not possess the minute to minute remembrances of each person although the more intense recollections are contained in my memory banks\nmarr raymond called renny yes i do\nyes\nblame you\nthere are no records of any blame against

here\nokay doctor weve input all the data you collected on the surface\nyou handle that unit like a veteran doctor\nand if they do we might find a pattern a kind of marker left behind by the entity thats a good idea data\ngetting that readout now data\nthere it is do you see it\nso we know the entity leaves antiprotons behind\nsure we can set the ships lateral sensors for gamma radiation\naye sir\nno change in the sensor readings\ncaptain im reading a transmission from the entity a series of graviton pulses\nall graviton pulses from the entity have stopped\nvibration amplitude is increasing it cant last much longer\nmay be i can create an override sequence shut it down from here\ni can override her programme but its going to take some time\ncommander doctor ki lamarr\nyou were on the surface during the attack\nremarkable you and your group are the only known beings ever to survive an assault by the crystalline entity\ni should say and your android he was there too\nwell shall we get started\noh commander a chance to talk to survivors so soon after an attack ive been waiting years for this i dont want to waste a moment more\nthats typical it could take years for anything to grow again\nthe crystalline entity seems to function like a gigantic electromagnetic collector it needs a lot of power to keep going so it strips every form of life from the worlds it encounters and converts it all into energy\nexcept witnesses for the first time in eleven recorded attacks now why i wonder did it spare your group\nmy point is that until now there have never been any survivors\ni would like to do interviews with each of the survivors collect as much specific detail asic an of their observations\nand id like to inspect the remains of melon a colony as soon as possible\nif you dont mind captain i prefer to choose my own team\ni am aware of his origin sim very much aware that his brother lore worked with the crystalline entity led it to omicron theta where it killed every living thing i dont think its unreasonable that i should prefer to make another choice\nas you wish captain\ncommander i can hear everything you say to me if there is anything worth my response you can be sure i will not be silent\nits old news tomei found evidence of bi trium on the last three attack sites it seems to be a residual that the entity produces after it absorbs living matter im actually more interested in this cave it still amazes me that your group was spared\nrefractory metals yes i know on two separate occasions settlers sought refuge in caves some of them deeper than this one they perished anyway\nthe tunnels on for lat three had strong deposits of kel bon it eyes\nperhaps it was you\nmaybe it was your presence which made the entity pass over the people in this cave did that occur to you\nif you had been in contact with the entity if thats the reason melona was attacked it surely wouldnt have killed it sally\ndid you\nyou dont understand i am accusing you of collaborating with that monster\nits amazing you cant feel anything can you nothing i say to you hurts you\nim getting a slight elevation on mono caladium particulates in this cave wall are you making note of it\nmy son died on omicron theta he was sixteen when the colony was attacked that is the reason i have became an expert on the crystalline entity i have spent my life studying it tracking it and hoping someday to find it and if i learn you have been helping that thing in any way whatsoever i will see to it that you are disassembled piece by piece\njust a minute commander i have some cellulose readings from soil samples that we rent included\none thing about spending your life gathering information you learn your way around computers hydrocarbons slightly elevated bit rious filaments in trace amounts lanthanides nitrates all normal nothing different everything falls within the parameters i established at the other attack sites\nive never surveyed a site so soon after an attack i thought maybe id find something new something that would make a difference\nwhy would i do that\nfrankly i just dont see what that would get us\na sharp spike atten kev another a pattern\nif it also deposits antiprotons in space as it travels can we detect them\nwell lets get to it shall we\nit seems i owe you thanks commander\nive never read that it wasnt in any of his records\nid heard that you d been programmed with the experiences of the colonists but frankly i find it hard to believe bridge\nyou possess their thoughts\ninteresting\nthere a spike atten kev and again its the same pattern we saw in engineering\ncaptain ive done some preliminary estimates on the firing pattern we need in order to destroy the entity the photon torpedoes will require some reprogramming but with your permission ill give the calculations to lieutenant worf\ni beg your pardon\ni dont understand why are we pursuing the entity if not to destroy it\nwhat do you propose we trackitdown greet it warmly and ask if it would mind terribly not ravaging anymore planets\nwhy why not just kill it\nwhat\nto what end\nits needs are to slaughter people by the thousands it is nothing but a giant killing machine\nthat would be small comfort for those who have died to feed it were not talking about cuttlefish were talking about people\nami disturbing you\ncommander theres something i want to say you have been helpful to me and kind and i repaid you with accusations and i realise i may have been wrong\ncaptain picard has told me youve done work in trying to establish communication with the entity\nlike tapping a crystal goblet\nall right commander just what kind of memories do you retain of the colonists\ndo you have any of my sons memories\ni see and his journals\ni was wondering do you know did he blame me\nfor going away for leaving him on omicron theta\ni left him with friends i chose to pursue my own career i planned to go back but things kept interfering i kept thinking ill go next month and there werent anymore next months\nhe was what else do you know\ni believe so there are some details to iron out\nive found it easy to talk to you commander do you mind if i tell you something\nafter hearing the screams of those men i found it hard not to think about my son about what happened to him ive read stories about soldiers in the battlefield wounded dying they call for their mothers and ive often wondered if my son called for me if he died wondering why i didnt come to him\nill write a subroutine that will allow us to change the frequency of the graviton beam data you told me you carried some of my sons memories\nwhat can you tell me about renny what were those thoughts was he was he happy at all on omicron theta\nrenny started par rises squares when he was young too young really but the older children kept asking him to play and i couldnt keep him away he had this natural gift\ni remember he wrote me about that he was so proud im characterising pulse width sin nanoseconds sound right to you\na girlfriend i never knew about that of course the last person he would tell would be his mother what was she like\nthere now we can vary all the parameters directly from the bridge\ncould you do something for me it would mean a lot\nyou see all i have left of renny the only connection of him is there inside you i was wondering if you would talk to me in his voice i know you have the ability to sound like other people isnt that right\nmay be something from his journals\ncaptain we are reasonably sure its between here and the brechtian cluster if i start emitting the graviton beam now it may serve as a lure a kind of beacon\nwell start with a pulse width of five nanoseconds frequency one pulse per second\nlets ramp frequency\nwhat is it do you have something\nits beautiful\nyes yes proceed commander\nlets test that ramp the frequency again commander\nits working thats a response to our signal\nlet me try something else a continuous graviton beam\nits for you renny i did it for you\nit will never hurt anyone again\nof course\nhow long will you live data\nim glad as long as your e alive hell be alive i need your help data\nlike you did before tell me that you understand renny that you know i did it for you because i love you because i wanted to give you peace at last\nwhat kind of disturbance\nsee if you can contact the colony\nhow far are we\nbridge to laforge\nare you picking up any readings from melona\nensign increase to warp eight\nkeep hailing them all channels mister worf\ni know

crystalline entity than commander data he originated on omicron theta\nyou may request additional team members but in the best interest of this investigation i think you should work with commander

brechtian cluster\nreprogram the torpedoes mister worf lets hope we dont have to use them\nif we can possibly avoid firing on it i would hope it would be marr\nperhaps you should join me in my ready room\nwere not hunters doctor nor is it our role to exact revenge\ni dont denying that it may be necessary to fire on it but i look on that as a last resort\ni want to try to communicate with it\nwe know from our own experience that our shields will protect us so long as were in no danger i will make every effort to communicate\nif we can determine what its needs are we might find other sources to supply it\ndoctor the sperm whale on earth devours millions of cuttlefish as it roams the oceans it is not evil it is feeding the same may be true of the crystalline entity\ni would argue that the crystalline entity has as much right to be here as we do now commander data has some theories on how we might communicate please confer with him\na distress call from a ship called the kallis ko its

that were still picking up the gamma radiation pattern of the entity\nhave you and commander data made any progress in finding a means of communication\nplease keep working at it we may need it soon\ncome\nvery well oh one thing number one starfleet will be notifying carmen davila s family of her death and returning her personal effects would you care to enclose a letter\nis there something more number one\nof course\nwhy do you think that\nare you sure that thats it number one or are you being influenced by personal feelings\nmake it so\nfull stop\ndoctor continue emitting the signals

the doctor to her quarters\nfine but dont leave her unattended\nvery good at this rate well be able to bring the next wave of colonists in in about six months ive to tell you i envy you this is a beautiful place to put down roots\nno how do i strike you\nan adventurer arent you pioneers adventurers at heart\nvery interesting id love to discuss this further with you dinner tonight\nhavent we gotten you a replicator yet\nthis is sounding better all the time\nmy favourite part of dinner\nwhen the enterprise comes back tomorrow well get a crew started on that\ncarmen have you got construction started i didnt know about\ndata\ndata whats our best bet for cover\nstart gathering everybody together weve seen this before we know what it is now get moving\nfollow him lets go come on come on\nno stay together stay together this way this way this way\nive got you\ndata carmen\ncome on keep moving\nlets go lets go keep moving deeper into the cave come on deeper into the cave keep moving\nhow much protection will this cave give us\nlets seal off this entrance\ntheres got to be a ventilation source somewhere we need some light\nhow are the others\nshe didnt make it she was trying to save an old man who d fallen\ni think were going to be all right in here im not sure about the air supply so stay put dont move around dont expend unnecessary energy with any luck well be able to wait this thing out\nriker to enterprise riker to enterprise\ndata weve only seen the crystalline entity once before how do you know these metals will protect us\ni was afraid you were going to say something like that\nif i open that entrance and its still out there were dead\nor it may be out there waiting for us\neverybody stay here\nlieutenant worf i dont think ive ever seen a more beautiful sight\nthe crystalline entity paid usa visit we lost two colonists but we got the rest in here captains log stardate 451223 we have notified starfleet command of our intention to pursue and investigate the crystalline entity to that end we have been joined by doctor kila marra xeno log ist who has made studying the entity her life s work\nwelcome to the enterprise i am commander william riker\nglad you re here\nthats right\nwe were lucky\nlieutenant commander data was there yes\nid be glad to show you to your quarters\ntheres no vegetation no insects not even soil bacteria it left

much as we expected sir no survivors\nits still headed for the brechtian cluster we vere established our course\nyes sir id like that very much\npermission to speak freely sir\nive been thinking may be doctor marris right maybe we should destroy the entity\nits already killed thousands it will undoubtedly continue to kill unless we stop it i dont want those deaths on my conscience\nwith all due respect sir im not a raw cadet ive lost people on missions before if we take time to try to communicate with this thing we may lose our chance to destroy it and i dont think we can risk that i think ill go write that letter to carmen s family\nare we still picking up the entity s pattern\nshields up\nwhatsit doing checking us out\ncaptain the fact that they re not responding doesnt necessarily mean theres anything wrong the atmospheric disturbance could be jamming the signal\ni dont think you need an empath to sense that womans feelings theres hostility that she seems to have transferred from loreto data perhaps you shouldnt have forced them together so soon\nis it responding to us\nmaybe it doesnt like what were doing\nsome things very wrong captain\ncaptain sensors indicate a disturbance near the outpost on melon a four\ni can not tell we are still too far away it could be an electrical storm\naye sir captain there is no response from melon a colony but the disturbance in the atmosphere is increasing\nat current speed twenty seven hours\nsir the disturbance on melona is becoming more intense\nstill no response sir\nsix hours\ncommander commander riker are you there\ni can not sir there is no response\nsir the brechtian cluster is now five light years away\nsir\na large mass approaching at warp speed\nyes sir",

hours without any permanent damage well need a few days of hyro nalin treatments\ntheyre at eighty three rads and rising at a rate of about four rads per minute\nthe radiation levels is about twenty percent lower at this end of the bay lets move the containers over to here\nthe levels are still rising there must be some way to put that fire out\nlets hear it\nwhat about us\nwhat about this\nonce the air is vented the first thing youll feel is extreme pressure in your lungs you have to resist the temptation to exhale next our hands and feet will get cold then numb and some of the capillaries on exposed sections of the skin may burst\nwe will have about fifteen seconds of useful consciousness then about ten seconds of extreme disorientation then we pass out\nmay i\ni have surveyed all the turbo lifts and service crawl ways on this deck access to the bridge has been completely severed by emergency bulkheads\nheavy damage to section twenty three a has cut off access to sickbay i have ordered a security team to bring casualties here until further notice\nin that circumstance reestablishing control should be our top priority\nyes sir the most direct route is blocked but i believe we can use a starboard service crawl way\nthat is correct sir we have approximately fifty two metres remaining in this crawl way before we can safely exit into a main corridor\ncommander the current can not be off down from this relay box\nif the energy flowing through that arc were interrupted by a nonconductive material it is likely the circuit would be broken\ncommander much of my body frame is made up of tri polymers a nonconductive material\nyes sir\nthe power surge would cause a system failure in my internal processors and melt my primary power couplings however there is a chance that the damage would not be irreparable\ncommander our options are very limited\nmy positronic brain has several layers of shielding to protect me from power surges it would be possible for you to remove my cranial unit and take it with you\nyes sir is something wrong sir\nmy memory core and neural nets are self contained i would be fine sir\na remarkable experience commander\napparently so sir my neural nets are still fully operational you may begin by opening the ventral access panel located two centimetres beneath my right ear\nvery good commander you have established a connection i can now raise the door\nthe power reaching those monitors has been diverted from the bridge sir\nno siri do not have access to the containment field you will have to establish a new link locate the conduit sir\nyes sir you must now change the input matrix in my secondary optical port and then connect the conduit\nthat is not the correct port sir\nyou must hurry commander the containment field has dropped to sixteen percent\nthe field continues to drop sir collapse is imminent\ni have a connection siri am now stabilising the containment field\nan analysis of the lifespan of the swarming moths of gonal

hiro\nits all right hes just doing somersaults here feel\nright there\nsure there feel it when he s not turning hes kicking and punching when i want to sleep he wants to wake up at this point i just wish it were over\nokay a little foggy\nokay\nthere that should do it\nim all right i think\noh oho him having contractions\nno i mean contractions im going into labour\nits not open for debate like it or not this baby is coming\nthats easy for you to say\nworf has the baby turned\nso the head is down doctor crusher told me a few days ago that it hadnt she was nt worried because i still had a month to go\nworf have you ever done this before delivered a baby\nsometimes it doesnt go by the book worf\nthats what ive been doing\ni dont know i dont think its up to me it happens when it happens\nwell im sorry\ni am pushing\nokay\nhello you were wonderful worf i couldnt have done it without you hello captains log supplemental we are en route to starbase sixty seven to undergo repairs life aboard the enterprise is slowly returning to normal\nno\nno\nall right i am the very model of a modern major general ive information vegetable animal and mineral i cant do this\ni can not sing in front of people\nright and bypass the flow current and the computer still wont release the doors\nyes we can try theres an emergency hand actuator\nyes\nwhere\nim all right but i think we ve got a new problem one of the energy conduits must ve ruptured and ignited the poly duran ide inside the bulkhead thats a plasma fire\nwe ve got a bigger problem than that the quar atum in these containers is used in emergency thruster packs its normally pretty stable stuff but when you expose quar atum to radiation it has a way of exploding\nwhat are the radiation levels in the quar atum\nthat stuff gets unstable at around three hundred and fifty rads i still havent been able to get any power to this transporter\nthats a good idea it should buy us some time you know were going to have to do this by hand with all the radiation floating around in here we cant trust the anti grav units\nthe energy s being fed by the ships internal power grid and we cant even get near that the only way to stop it would be to eliminate its supply of oxygen wait a minute doctor ive got an idea its kind or wild but we just might be able to kill two birds with one stone\nokay we open the external door that would de pressurise the cargo bay and suck all of those containers out into space at the same time the lack of oxygen should put out the plasma fire\nwe just need to find something in here to hold onto while the air is evacuating then we close the door re pressurise the bay\nyeah that ought to do it\nsounds like fun\nokay once the air is evacuated one of us is going to need to get to that panel to re pressurise the bay\nwere ready are you okay ro\nsensors are picking up subspace distortions and high energy particles directly to starboard\ntheres another filament moving toward us sir\nchief

impact\nif its a boy michael after my father\nwe talked about this last night\ni have to go ive got a transporter simulation on the bridge bye bye michael\nim not sure who to feel sorry for the captain or the kids\nweve lost primary life support switching to secondary systems impulse and warp engines are offline\ncounsellor\nthe computers down it looks like we still have impulse power but not much else\nthis is the federation starship enterprise calling any vessel within range we are in distress and need assistance please respond im still not sure were even transmitting ill set the message on auto repeat and see if we get a response\nare you all right ro\nwe were hit by a quantum filament most of our systems are down and we havent been able to contact anyone off the bridge ro\nconfinement mode ro\nif the computer senses a hull breach it automatically closes emergency bulkheads to isolate the breach until we can clear those bulkheads well be cut off from the rest of the ship\nwhat about ten forward ro\nmy wife s there\ncan you sense anything counsellor\nlieutenant monroe was in command but she s dead i believe counsellor troi is the senior officer on the deck ro\nshe carries the rank of lieutenant commander\ni recommend we initiate emergency procedure alpha two bypass computer control and place all systems on manual override\naye aye sir ro\nthere just before the second time we were hit see the subspace distortion\nit can be hundreds of metres long but it has almost no mass which makes it very difficult to detect\nno thats a completely different phenomenon\nhow did you do that ro\nyou what ro\nbut thats a completely improper procedure you cant just dump that much raw energy into a bridge terminal without blowing ro\nswitch to primary bypass ro\nwhen the filament hit us the ship was momentarily charged as if it had come into contact with alive electrical wire ro\nif it falls to fifteen per cent the field will collapse and well have a containment breach\nif the containment field strength continues to drop at its present rate we still have at least two hours before it becomes critical ro\nexcuse me sir but thats damn coldblooded what about the people down there ro\nno evidence theyre dead either if you were trapped down there would you like us to just cut you loose and leave ro\nyes but my readings indicate theres no power down there they dont even have monitors to tell them theres a problem\nyes sir ro\naye sir ro\nwere in no danger until it drops below fifteen percent we can afford to wait and see if anyone in engineering notices those monitors\nensign theresa thermal inversion in the power coupling ro\nsir the field strength is stabilising eighteen percent twenty twenty five ro\ngot it\nthat is not the correct port sir\ncan we see the battle bridge and torpedo bay\ni planted radishes in this special dirt and they came up all weird\nwhy dont they answer\nwhat was that\ncani be an officer too\nyes sir\ni want to stay here with you captain\ni dont want to be an officer anymore i want to stay here with you\nwhat if that one doesnt open either\ni made the back piece\nhello\nno im afraid not but we will be visiting the hydroponics and astrophysics laboratories\nwell if youll come with me\ni want you to know were very proud of the science fair winners perhaps some of you will choose to pursue a career in starfleet well then what did you do for your science projects\ni see thats very very commendable and you\nhow interesting and you picard\nare you are you children all right\nbridge this is picard this is the captain can anyone hear me\ni dont know\ntheyre not dead communication is down thats all\nwe most certainly are not now listen to me no one here is going to die the bridge will be sending a rescue party as soon as possible so i want you all to stop crying everything is going to be all right\nthe external power is cut off\ni dont know\nyour name is marissa is that right well marissa im going to need a first officer to help me your e the oldest and so that makes you my number one\nthats what i always called my first officer so here\nthere now number one we need a crew to help us get that hatch off dont you think that jay here would make an excellent science officer what do you say jay will you join our crew\nof course forgive me jay gordon\nthere\nwell let me see your science project involved radishes did it not\nthen i shall appoint you my executive officer in charge of radishes\nthere right then lets get to work\ncan you climb up\ngood now look down the sides of the lift can you see two big clamps\ncan you see if those clamps are attached to long beams inside big grooves\nall right come down\nall right number one those big clamps are part of the emergency system if something goes wrong they redesigned to hold the turbolift in place but it would seem that they re damaged\nthats right now when they give way we shall fall so you ve got to get your crew out of here before that happens now there is a ladder along the wall of the shaft you can climb up that until you come to an open doorway\nmy ankle is broken i will just slow you down when you need to move quickly now you are the leader and that san order\npatterson your e an officer you have to obey orders\nwe dont have time to argue you must go now\nall right ill try but i want you to know this is mutiny now number one look at that control panel now the yellow control pad hit that once now the one below it hit twice now that should release the panel underneath\nnow you can pull it away\ngood now that bundle of wires thats optical cabling see how much of that you can pull out\ni cant open this door were going to have to climb up to the next deck\nwere going up ready\nthe lifts falling hang on\nwere all right were going to keep on climbing just dont look down\nwere right with you patterson your e not going to fall everything will be all right if you just keep climbing what we need is a climbing song marissa is there a song you sing at school\nim afraid i dont know that one i know frere jacques thats a song i used to sing when i was at school patterson do you know that one good it goes like this frere jacques frere jacques dormezvousdormezvous\nvery good now keep singing\nhello its good to see you again what brings you to the bridge\nthank you thankyouverymuch\nand a wonderful job you did of it too well later this afternoon were going to finish the tour i promised you starting with the battle bridge ill see you at fourteen hundred hours you have the bridge number one\nwait ive got it william its a great name william obrien its got a nice ring to it\nhes going to be a hell of a gymnast\nhow do you feel\njust lie still for awhile well get you to sickbay as soon as we can\nreport\ni think we should assume the worst that everyone on the bridge is dead theres no one is in control of the ship\nagreed can we get to engineering\nokay you and i will try to get there mister worf this room is going to fill with wounded in a few minutes and they re going to need help i want you to stay in charge here\nlets go\nthirteen sixty five baker that should put us right behind shuttle bay two\ncoolant leak\nwe cant just sit here\ni dont see any material in here that could handle that much current\nare you suggesting we use your own body\ndata theres half a million amps flowing through that arc could your body handle that much current\nno\nfirst of all android or not i wouldnt ask anyone to take that kind of risk second if the computer is not working in engineering im going to need your help to get control of the ship\nlet me get this straight you want me to take off your head\nwell data would you be all right\nwell like you said our choices are very limited riker\nare you all right did the shielding work\nokay try it\ntheres no power on this entire deck yet somehow these monitors are working\nbut why unless there s something they want us something they need us to see wait a minute data the containment field strength is down to eighteen percent can you stabilise it\ngot it\nsorry\nim trying you need a bigger head\ntry it now\nyou just cant stay away from the big chair can you\ncaptain picard to the bridge please\naye sir back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc copyright 1966 present the

ro\nyes how big is a quantum filament\nso its like a cosmic string\nwhat is our engine status ensign ro\nwhich means ro\nwhat do you suggest ro\nyou said there was no way to stabilise the containment field from the bridge could it be done from engineering\ncould we divert energy from the bridge to those monitors\ni believe there are still people alive down there and im going to give them every chance assuming they re alive they ll be hoping theres someone up here who can help them so well help them chief divert the necessary power to engineering\nthank you ensign proceed\nhave you made preparations to separate the saucer section ro\nwhat happened ro\nwe will separate the ship when i decide that its time and not before is that clear ensign ro\nyou could have easily been right\nnow just wait here\ni dont think im cut out to be captain first officer may be i understand there are nt many qualifications\nsickbay\nyes sir\nover here\nthere will be a sharp pain as is et the bone

are doing very well i am sure the child will arrive soon\nturned\ni am not certain cant you tell\nyesno i have taken the starfleet emergency medical course in a computerised simulation i assisted in the delivery of a human baby\ni am sure everything will be fine\ncongratulations you are fully dilated to ten centimetres you may now give birth\nbearing down is the next stage it should start at full dilation why has it not begun\nthe computer simulation was not like this that delivery was very orderly\ndid you feel an uncontrollable urge to push\ngood you are bearing down now you must push with each contraction and i must urge you gently but firmly to push harder push keiko push hard push keiko push push\nthe baby is emerging head first one more contraction\nthats good push push hard i have

figure it out\ni noticed it uses a visual interface we could connect it through an optical sensor\nlets see what happens\nits activating the reticular formation\ni wonder what happens after prolonged exposure\nthe effect seems centred around the frontal lobe\nits stimulating the septal area\nno wonder its so popular\nim seeing widespread bonding to neuro receptors\nare you saying you think the games addictive\ndoesnt that area control higher reasoning\nive tried it thanks its great\nwhere have you been everyones after me to try it\ni hope he makes a ship wide announcement or something because this thing is really starting to give me the creeps\nwe left them in our quarters\nno thanks\ndata\nthe nurse is still playing the game\nhow can that be hes unconscious\nwesley look at that\nthe cuts are precise look how clean the edges are computer increase magnification factor four\nwhy would one of them do this to him\nthen data would be a threat to that plan and only with data out of the way would everybody become addicted\nit worked\nim supposed to be on duty in engineering ive got to get back before commander laforge suspects something\nwesley dont forget law ninety one always watch your back\nwhat are you doing\nits your turn wesley play the game\ni never saw you wear these afraid someone might see your birthmark\ni wish you didnt have to go\nyoull write wont

sir\nyeah i thought after being on the enterprise it would be a breeze but theres a lot more to learn than just starship operations what was your first year like\nlike what\ntell me about it my first week that i was there this guy named adam marton i reprogrammed the sonic shower to cover me with mud it took me a while but i got him back really good\nthanks\nthey still hold it every year\ni know what you mean i cant even dance\nthe dancing doctors he tried to teach me too but i just dont have the knack\nill let you know\nill modify the planetary scanners\nno problem ill compress the signal

novakovic h for anthropology and horne for creative writing\nyeah he is and hes good too and you ll be pleased to know i took your advice the first week that i was there i went and met boothby\nhe didnt remember you sir at first i found an old yearbook photo and he remembered you right away he said he s very proud of you that your e captain of the enterprise\nnot that i can tell he took me on a grand tour of the place he showed me every single blade of grass practically\nsir what do the initial saf stand for\nboothby said he caught you carving those initials into his prized elm tree\nconduits twelve and twenty two are still down for testing\nyou have a funny way of looking at conduit configuration but it works\nwhat are all these laws that i keep hearing about\nhow many do you have\nit ll be on line in a few minutes im way ahead of you\nwhy do i get the feeling that you already know me\nthere is another side to that story\nthis isnt fair i hardly know anything about

engineering\nmom\nwell have time together i promise\nokay\nmom i really need to get ready\nthanks i will\nreally my very first friend was a warp coil\nsounds kind of lonely well now youre here\nwell im glad\nyeah what kind of game is it\nhave you played it\nmy mom has one she keeps trying to get me to play it\ndont you think thats a little strange everybody playing it all the time\ni wonder how it works\nid like to know a little bit more about it before i try it\nyeah we could hook it up to one of the computers the medical programs in the lab can be set up to emulate human responses\nive loaded the neurological behaviour programme this sensor pad should allow the computer to process whatever information the games ends at it\nokay\ntheres heavy synaptic activity all over the place\nspeed up the processor and well find out\ncomputer enhance frontal lobe full spectrum\nthats the pleasure centre of the brain whatever this thing does it must feel pretty good\nlook at this serotonin levels are way off lets run a neurochemical analysis\ncorrect me if im wrong but this looks like a psychotropic reaction\nwhats going on in the prefrontal cortex\nyeah it sure does id better go talk to the captain\nsorry to bother you sir\nthanks\ntheyre coming along fine but thats not what im here to talk to you about\ntheresa game going around its something that commander riker brought back from risa its a device that hooks around the ears\ni did some preliminary tests on the game and what i found leads me to believe that it may have some harmful side effects specifically sir i think its psychotropic ally addictive\nthe game initiates a serotonin cascade in the frontal lobe of the brain now i know that s nothing conclusive but it could explain why everyone is so attracted to it and at the same time it stimulates the brains reasoning centre i dont know what thats all about\nthank you sir\nrobin\ni know i got stopped in the corridor twice i talked to the captain hes going to look into it\nshe said no thanks\nyou know what else is really weird if this game is so addictive theres only one person on board we can be sure wouldnt be affected by it\nright and he managed to get injured right when the game was brought on board wed better take a look at him\nmaybe you should go check again\ni dont know what to make of this theres brain activity all his systems seem to be working\nmay be theresa signal breach between his brain and his body lets map his nervous system and see if we can isolate a weak link patch the neural output through to that station here the signal stops just below his cortex processor theres some kind of damage its almost undetectable lets look at it on the viewer\nit looks like some of his positronic links have been severed\nonly two people on board know enough about data to do something like this commander laforge and my mother\nmay be theres more going on here than we thought what if someone s trying to use the game for some purpose other than pleasure\nand everyone has except us\nin here mom\nwe should keep these mockups with us we cant trust anyone anymore not even the captain\nokay when you get there start accessing the codes for the security tracking system theres something i want to try\nyou too\ndeck thirtysix\nim only levelten\nthats great\nill try that\ni think were going to be okay ive just got one more thing to do help me compile the force field overrides\ni created a site to site transporter programme if things get difficult this ll keep us one step ahead of them were able to access the security tracking codes robin\ncomputer transport programme crusher one\nno let go of me\nno\nno\ni managed to reconnect his positronic matrix\nnow i wonder who started that birthmark rumour\nme too\nsomebody has to kill all

with everyone who wants an audience but he is one man the demands on his time are formidable if you would like me to take him a message\na favour\na cloaked vessel this is no small favour captain\nhow would it benefit the klingon empire im sure gowron will ask\nthat is what you want me to tell him\ni see\ni apologise captain for the mystery but we must attempt to contain the information im about to reveal to you at least as long as possible\nthree weeks ago one of our most celebrated ambassadors an advisor to federation leaders for generations disappeared he left no word of his destination two days ago intelligence reports placed him on romulus and i assure you it was an unauthorised visit computer initiate linkage between this terminal and starbase computer system alpha two nine\nif it is the damage to federation security would be immeasurable taken on romulus by long range scanner computer enhance image in section four delta captains log stardate 452364asi study the intelligence

your right eye is point zero zero four higher than your left\nthese two still have an appointment with mister mott to have their hairpieces designed\ncaptain i have a visual identification of senator par dek of romulus this is a bar olian record of a trade negotiation in which par dek participated four years ago\nyes sir\nhe has been in public service since he was a young man a senator for nine decades he is considered a man of the people he has sponsored many reforms reportedly romulan leadership considers him to be somewhat of a radical because he has been an advocate of peace throughout his career\nthe district he represents is called the kr oct on segment he maintains a dwelling there\nthere is more siri have taken the liberty of expanding the parameters of my search and have discovered that par dek has several relatives in the kr oct on segment i believe you will be able to locate him there on the third day of the romulan week when the senate is not in session\nthank you sir\nremovable\nno doctor they are fully integrated components\ncaptain kv ada is this the captains quarters or my own\nthese quarters were obviously intended for one crew members ir there is but a single sleeping space\nsince i do not require sleep i propose you take the shelf siri am content to stand\nare you comfortable sir\ngoodnight captain sleep well sir\nsir was i making noise sir\ni was processing all of the information we have accumulated on romulan society i am preparing for the task of impersonating a romulan\nwould you like me to discontinue sir\ni am not looking at anything siri am continuing to organise my files\ni am sorry if i was disturbing you siri will not look in your direction\ndo you not wish to sleep sir\ni would be happy to i have been studying the kr oct on segment as you asked and have selected an appropriate site for our transport\ni would not have thought it possible siri am eager to test the success of our efforts it does remain to be seen if the romulans will accept us captain you have seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of ambassadors are ks death\ni do not entirely understand sir as a vulcan ambassador spock would simply see death as the logical result of his fathers illness\nconsidering the exceptionally long life span of vulcans it does seem odd that sarek and spock did not choose to resolve those differences in the time allowed\nthis is definitely the street on which the intelligence scan of spock and par dek was taken sir adjusting for the optical distortions i am able to verify the architectural features\ni am sorry captain i will be more careful\ni understand siri have found the place where they were standing\nit is here at this doorway a legal intercessors office the name is similar to par deks it would appear to be one of his relatives\nnonetheless i recommend we keep this location under observation i have clearly determined par deks routine on days when the senate is not in session he invariably comes to this section after the median hour\nwe are here for the day from the city of rate g\nwhy do you say that\nit is a misconception that all rate gs speak with a particular inflection in fact there are twelve different\nwe may not have to direct your view to the far corner sir\nis that not par dek\nperhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup sir\nklim do kachin quartermaster surplus depot

dorian eel onboard a freighter in someones locker\nif you have time ill show it to you i still have it nursed her back to health\nwhat where is it what happened to it these are the correct coordinates\nthe tp au is missing\nim not accustomed to losing things commander i will find your ship for you i have the tp au cross referenced in four different directories\nof course\nit was routed to the tripoli a holding vessel on the outer rim of the shipyard\nhow can that be\nin all the time that the zak dorn have operated this depot nothing has ever been lost never\ni do not understand this this is not possible we beam goods to the tripoli on a regular schedule there was a shipment yesterday another is set for today it must be there\njust over two hours from now a shipment of deuterium storage tanks\nhes taking the position assigned to the tripoli the coordinates are identical\ni know my duty captain when i am given orders i follow them but i do not like secrets i want to know why we are going on this mission\nyour e going after the defect or arent you\ndo you think information like that stays a secret ambassador spock has gone to romulus and you are going after him\nif we are discovered by the romulans it means death for us all\nhe chugh os very well captain we have set a course for romulus\nit may not be what your e used to on a starfleet ship\nboth we have limited space we are a military ship not a pleasure craft\nyoull sleep klingon style we do not soften our bodies by putting down a pad\nyoull take your meals with us but we do not serve federation food\nja tlh\nso

you\ndont you two look sweet be careful android some romulan beauty might take a liking to you lick that paint right off your ears you do you know what the romulans will do to you if they discover who you are\njust so we understand each other my orders dont include rescue missions\nmeh hod\nme hma hgh os\nsenator we seem to be having some problems\nthat pretty well indicates that they re vulcan and dent arium also means that whatever this was it was originally designed for use in space from the look of the damage it must ve been a high speed impact\ncould it be a weapons array\nthis is going to be like putting together a big jigsaw puzzle when you dont know even know what the pictures supposed to be\nwhat we seem to have here is a navigational deflector array or at least whats left of one\nbeats me commander every question we answer here seems to bring up two more\nyes sir metallurgical analysis confirmed that and by running a molecular pattern trace we were actually able to identify the ship ast pau it was decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot at qual or two as far as anybody know sits still there\nwheres the ship now\nwhen it was brought here was it stripped of material armament sensors\ncan you tell us what happened to its navigational deflector\naye sir\nsounds like they dont want to be identified\nsensors indicate a combat vessel origin undetermined heavily armed mass and density suggest that its fully loaded with cargo id say from these internal scans a good deal of that cargo is weaponry\ncommander readings indicate surface to ship transport has begun\naye sir\nthat ship easily matches our armament commander\naye sir\nwe destroyed one of their phaser arrays looks like collateral damage in the cargo area commander im picking up massive power fluctuations internal explosions with all the armament that ship is carrying its going to blow\nvery good senator\nah senator par dek you received my message\nwhat do you know of this human jean luc picard a starfleet captain\nyou havent seen him recently\ni have received intelligence indicating hes on his way here perhaps here already\nyes curious isnt it i suppose wed better find out if the report is accurate or merely rumour circulate his likeness among the security forces remind them that if he is here hes probably disguised as one of us\ni got here as quickly as i could proconsul\ni know nothing of him\nto my knowledge i have never seen him\nhere on romulus\nill see to it\nill take care of that come 1\nwelcome to romulus captain picard dont let our soldiers frighten you we had to get you off the street as quickly as we could romulan security knows that your e here iam par dek you are among friends captain\nmint tea its been years since ive had it vulcans have some kind of strange concoction they call mint you d never recognise it\nhe didnt even say goodbye to his father before he left\nno he wrapped up all of his affairs carefully he knew he was going\ncaptain as far as im concerned he disappeared a long time ago\nnot between us between spock and his father they had argued for years that was family but when the debates over the cardassian war began he attacked sarek s position publicly he showed no loyalty to his father\ni was offended i made sure spock knew it im very protective of my husband i do not apologise for it\ni dont know if you could sees are kasi do wasting in bed whispering to himself he wants to see his son he wants to heal any rift that may still remain now it may be too late\nif it were anyone else i would never permit it but you are a part of him and he of you\nhe is like this most of the time his emotions have taken over sometimes i can bring him out of its are k you will listen\npicard is here\ni will leave you alone with him he will either acknowledge you or he wont\ni must admit youve piqued my curiosity admiral\na defection\nwe should tells are ks wife of our plans\nand sarek\nthe man is dying and its my honour to tell him that his son may have betrayed the federation\ni met him once what i know of him comes from history books and of course my mind meld with his father\nnot as much as you d imagine sarek and spock well sometimes fathers and sons\noh one other thing take a look at this turned up during an intelligence sweep\nwhat do you make of it\nthey were found inc rates marked medical supplies\nits been sent to vulcan for identification starfleet have requested that we lend a hand\nperrin do you know why ive come to vulcan i must talk to you about spock\nis it possible he could have been abducted\ndo you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this\nwould it be inappropriate to ask what happened between you and spock\ni was not aware that sarek was offended by spock s opposition\ndoes sarek have any idea why spock might have left\nperrin would you allow me to see sarek\nsarek ive come a long way to see you\ni must speak to you about your son\nabout spock\nyes hes missing\nhello old friend\ni need your help i must find spock\ni know hes been reported on romulus\nyes\ni had hoped to find that out from you\nyes do you have any idea what might have taken him to romulus\nis there anyone on romulus he might know or choose to contact\nwho is par dek\nwho is par dek\npar dek represented romulus\nits been suggested that spock might have defected\nbut you believe he might have gone there to see par dek\nive heard of him\ndo you know what business they might have together\nsarek were a part of each other i know that he has caused you pain but i also know that you love him\npeace and long life\nand prosper captains log stardate 452401 to cross the neutral zone i will require a cloaked ship to that end i have set a course for the klingon home world after all we did for gowron during the recent war i am certain he will be happy to return a favour\nstill no response from the klingons mister worf\nhes ignoring me what other explanation is there\nyes lieutenant\ni see\nhe can take all the credit he wants i dont care t but i do need a ship well if gowron wont talk to me get someone who will somebody on the high council kt al perhaps\nthats all\nrun it again computer freeze call up the intelligence scan of spock on romulus computer enhance far left figure and compare same man par dek one question answered what do we know of him\ni can see why spock would cultivate a relationship with him where would we find him other than on the floor of the romulan senate\nthank you mister data\nmister data your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me\ngowron or kt al\nname\non screen\nis gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for the past three days\na message very well tell gowron leader of the high council of the klingon empire that his arbiter of succession jean luc picard needs a favour\ni require a cloaked vessel\nit is for a mission that could have repercussions throughout the quadrant\nthe only benefit to the klingon empire would be our gratitude\nyes and please add that if he is unable to provide a ship then i am sure there are others in the klingon empire who would be willing to help me and then they would have our gratitude\nalso please tell him that i am immensely gratified that he is prospering sowell a tribute to his skilled leadership\nwhat about his skin colour\nnobodys perfect doctor but crusher\nanything from gowron\nthirty minutes number one\nyour e certain this is vulcan\nyes lieutenant\nmister worf will you convey my gratitude to the captain and advise him that mister data and i will be transporting over shortly\nagreed thank you mister laforge\nim sorry its a classified matter\ndefect or\ncaptain your orders are to take us to a set of coordinates near romulus and to bring us back and that is all i am prepared to discuss\ni realise that\nquite nice thank you\nof course this will be fine\ngood i prefer it that way\nive been looking forward gag h havent had it for quite awhile very fresh\nyes i do first officers log stardate 452406 the enterprise is nearing qual or two home of a federation surplus depot operated by the zak dorn we hope to find out how the salvaged deflector array ended up in the hands of the ferengi\nim sure the klingons found it amusing to put us in here together\nvery well mister data thank you\ni suppose so\nthank you\nwhat are you doing\nno not exactly\ni see\nno please go on\nwhat are you looking at\nbut your e looking at me\ni dont think so mister data lets go on with the files\nsarek is dead\nwell mister data what do you think\nsarek and i share a particular bond our lives touched in an unusual way i admit i feel the effects of his death the tenor of this mission has changed mister data at least it has for me we were sent to confront spock about his disappearance now i also have to tell him that his father is dead\nits never quite that simple not even for a vulcan certainly not for spock who is half human years spent in conflict and now the chance to resolve all of those differences is gone\nfather and son both proud both stubborn more alike than either of them were prepared to admit a lifetime spent building emotional barriers theyre very difficult to break down and now the time has come its too late its a difficult moment its a lonely one its a moment spock is about to face\ni have a good idea were ready to transport down to the surface\nwhere were they standing data you removing about in a very well android way\ndont call me captain\nwhere\nhes not open for business yet\nvery well lets sample the

continuing dialogue with the romulans i told him it was illogical to maintain such an expectation spock was always so impressionable this romulan par dek had no support at home of course in the end i was proven correct i gave spock the benefit of experience of logic he never listened never listened\nnever i will accept many things but never that\nthe romulan senator how do you know par dek\nthats what he s done hes gone to see par dek\nnoi never knew what spock was doing when he was a boy he would disappear for days into the mountains i asked him where he had gone what he had done he refused

little rusty\nyes yes i know\nthree weeks ago one of our most celebrated ambassadors an advisor to federation leaders for generations disappeared\nweve just received a priority one distress call from the colony on dul is ian four a massive failure of the environmental support systems theyre going to require evacuation\nim sure its not equipped to handle something of this scale will\njolan tru mister spock here look what ive brought you\nthey read to us from it at the meetings it tells the story of the vulcan separation\ni just wanted to show it to mister spock\nwill you tell us more stories about vulcan\njolan tru\nspock ive been looking for you\ndoes he still speak of reunification\nhave you ever seen these\nthey were my toys when i was small\nyes as did their parents before them to prepare us for the day when we would live again with our vulcan cousins 1\nthis way par dek never saw these caves its safe they wont find us here\ncaptain picard regrets detaining you but it will be necessary for a while longer in addition i require access to your ships computer\ni am going to attempt to penetrate the romulan central information net\ni have unique skills that may allow me to succeed\nyour entry codes can be easily reconfigured after we depart and captain picard has authorised me to share with you any information we obtain from the romulan databanks\nwe will also need to communicate with the enterprise insect or two thirteen\nusing conventional means that would be true however i suggest we piggyback our signal on romulan subspace transmissions\na human metaphor pardon me we would use a romulan signal as a carrier for own one thus disguising its origin\ni believe it would during the last hour i have conducted a systematic review of the entire romulan subspace grid i have compared my findings with the specifications of your own transmission array they appear to be compatible\nthankyou for your cooperation 1\nnegative captain the romulan information net employs a progressive encryption lock i have been unable to penetrate their security measures\nby all means ambassador\nyes sir the twenty ninth is the only one i can not bypass\nin what manner sir\ninteresting i have not considered that and captain picard has been a role model in my quest to be more human\nyes ambassador\nyou are half human\nyet you have chosen a vulcan way of life\nin effect you have abandoned what i have sought all my life\nambassador spock may i ask a personal question\nas you examine your life do you find you have missed your humanity\nno regrets that is a human expression\nwe are losing our romulan carrier wave sir\ncaptain the romulan subspace logs identify a transmission from the romulan surface to a bar olian ship near galor nd on core twelve hours ago\nthis would not appear to be routine i was able to trace the source of the transmission it incorporates the code prefix of romulan intelligence\nit is a short sequence of numbers one four zero zero\nno sir\nhow do you know that ambassador\nlieutenant commander data\nperhaps you would be happier in another job\ni believe so ambassador\ni will be more observant in the future sir\ncommunication lines have been terminated at the transmitter but i am quite certain the message was sent prior to the interruption\ni disagree commander after studying the design of this structure i have determined that our best route of escape would be the underground exit to the east of this wing i have disconnected certain security scanners to assist us i am afraid we can not permit you to warn your guards\ncaptain we will need to reach our transport site in fourteen minutes\naye sir\nthis is ambassador spock of vulcan by now federation sensors are tracking three vulcan ships crossing the neutral zone these ships carry the future of the romulan and vulcan people our long conflict is finally over\nbe careful android some romulan beauty might take a liking to you lick that paint right off your ears you do you know what the romulans will do to you if they discover who you are\nwe have more important things to attend to than acting as your nurse maids\naccess to our computer for what purpose\ndont bother we ve been trying for years\ni can not reveal classified klingon entry codes to starfleet\nanything else\nyou do and the romulans will instantly know our coordinates\npiggyback\nit wont work\ngalor nd on core is along the bar olian trade route they trade a great deal with the romulans its probably just routine\nbeats me commander every question we answer here seems to bring up two more\nnegative commander\nthat would put them on a course to vulcan they dont seem to be in any hurry theyre only moving at warp one commander\nnone of the transponder signatures matches that of the missing ship they could have been altered ill keep checking\nive checked every sensor display backwards and forwards if the romulans altered them they didnt leave any fingerprints i cant tie any of them to the surplus yard\nromulan warbird de cloaking alongside the vulcan ships\nthere were over two thousand romulan troops on board those ships\nwhat do you know of this human jean luc picard a starfleet captain\nenter\nyes par dek come in\nplease ive never liked titles since i was a lowly uh lan in the romulan guardia mn eral how is it again par deks tried to show me\ngood\nwill we see you and your wife tomorrow at the state dinner\nits been years since old par deks been invited to an official function hes far too attached to the common man for most peoples comfort\nlet me tell you something spock were going to start something here you and i that will redraw the face of the quadrant\ni believe it must eventually come our two worlds need each other\ni want you to know exactly where i stand\nthings are not what they once were in the senate the old leaders have lost the respect of the people involvement in the klingon war endless confrontations with the federation they retired of it times are changing and leaders who refuse to change with them will no longer be leaders spock i am prepared to publicly endorse the opening of talks between our peoples what do you think the vulcan people think of that\nbut surely with a man of your influence leading the way\nvery well can we meet again tomorrow\ngood jolan tru spock oh live long and prosper 1\nwhat is that dreadful noise it sounds like a bar daki an pronghorn moose you know what i want to hear\nwheres the waiter is there a waiter in this sorry place\nyes i need more napkins\nwhat did you say\nwho are you\nami supposed to stand up and salute\nwell you ve got the wrong ferengi i never trade in vulcan ships\nwho would want a vulcan ship vulcans are pacifists ideal in warships can somebody get me a napkin\nhypothetically speaking\ni never learned to speak hypothetical\nare you crazy\ni delivered it to a bar olian freighter\ni dont remember ow watch it youre stretching my neck\nat galor nd on core near the neutral zone thats all i know i swear it\ndt an you should not bring that out here you ve been told many times\noff with you well see you later tonight\nperhaps this is not such a good place to talk\nso what do you think of your enemy captain picard\nmany of my colleagues fear what they have to say but i have learned to listen carefully children liked tan are our future old men like me will not be able to hold onto ancient prejudice and hostility young people wont allow it but now now that they ve met their first real vulcan it has only inspired them more i am sure that is evident to you spock\nromulans are passionate people the vulcans will learn to appreciate that quality in us\nwe will know so on the proconsul has agreed to meet with you first officers log stardate 452458 the enterprise remains at qual or two as we continue to investigate the theft of a surplus vulcan ship the trail has led us to the former wife of a deceased smuggler\nproconsul\nambassador spock of vulcan\npermit me to withdraw\nwere looking forward to it\nbut if neral is ready to publicly endorse reunification\nthat may be true\nwhat does it mean\nwhy would they need a vulcan ship\nhow could they know of this location someone has betrayed us\nspock we ve been friends for eighty years\njolan tru spock\nits been suggested that spock might have defected\ni have a good idea\nyouve made a mistake 1\ni have come on an urgent mission from the federation im looking for ambassador spock\nthat was to have been my question of you sir\non the contrary it is very much starfleet s concern you reina position to compromise the security of the federation\nthat is not satisfactory\nand i will not return without a full explanation ambassador with great respect for all that youve achieved on behalf of the federation this sort of cowboy diplomacy will not easily be tolerated anymore\nif you wish to undertake a mission with obvious repercussions to the federation then you should discuss it with the federation im here as their representative youll have to discuss it with me\ni also have the responsibility of being the bearer of unhappy news\nit was an honour he is a great man\ni was with him before coming here he expressed his pride in you his love\nno those feelings came from his heart spock he shared them with me i know\nreunification after so many centuries after so many fundamental differences have evolved between your peoples\nwhat is this first step that par dek suggests\nwhy would you not bring something so important to the attention of your own people or the federation\nhistory is aware of the role you played ambassador\nambassador your logic escapes me if i didnt know better i would say that your judgment is influenced by your emotions\ni speak as a starfleet officer and i can not ignore the risks to you\nnevertheless sir im not prepared to leave until your affairs are completed\nthen im in good company sir\nhow widespread is this movement\nserious enough for the leaders to suddenly embrace a vulcan peace initiative i have some difficulty in accepting that\ni will be the first to cheer when the neutral zone is abolished but i wonder if this movement is strong enough to reshape the entire romulan political landscape\nhello dt an\nthese people are no ones enemy senator\nits hard to believe that he could rise to the rank of senate proconsul without the support of the romulan traditionalists\nthen how can he turn his back on them so easily how can he endorse reunification when its considered subversive 1\nperhaps because he s hoping to expose members of your movement 2\nthat is not true\nyou let their emotions way you\nyou are as sceptical asia mis it logical to ignore your own good sense\nthat is the second time you have accused me of speaking with another man s voice its true he will always be a part of me his experiences his spirit but i speak with my own voice no this\nis it so important that you to win one last argument\nbut your fight with sarek is over spock and you have none with me\neven if it leads you into a romulan trap\nhave you had any success mister data\ni think ill take this opportunity to remove my ears\nand the romulans are suddenly very interested in bonding with the vulcans spock has been meeting with the new senate proconsul about reunification\nthe proconsul says that he is prepared to endorse peace talks\nthe ambassador is sceptical but he cares a great deal about reunification as long as theres a chance of success hes prepared to pursue it\nneither do i counsellor how soon can you beat galor nd on core number one\nwell this may prove to be a wildgoose chase but i dont see that we have any other choice do you\nwell advise you further as soon as you reach your destination number one picard out\ncan you access it\nnothing more\nthe only communication that was sent were the numbers one four zero zero\npeace envoy in a stolen vulcan ship\nthe moment those vulcan ships appear in the neutral zone the enterprise will move to intercept\ndo you seriously believe that the federation will not immediately intervene\nyou can hardly believe this will convince anyone\nsuggestions\nwell done mister data though i dont think you got commander rikers hair quite right\nwell done mister data\nwhat will you do now 2\nthe federation will welcome that day\ni wish you well\nambassador\ni have learned it is useless to argue with you once your mind is set\nwould it surprise you to learn that he found them

have returned they need to see you immediately ive told par dek hell meet you at the cave\ni gave spock the benefit of experience of logic he never listened\nthat will become clear very shortly captain picard welcome to romulus i trust youve enjoyed your visit and this is the android i have come to respect in battle\nthe great spock very well senator par dek your service to the romulan people is noted and appreciated\ndo not be distressed your dream of reunification is not dead it will simply take a different form the romulan conquest of vulcan bring them first officers log supplemental the enterprise has reached galor nd on core near the border of the neutral zone\ncome in gentlemen take a seat please excuse me im just finishing up a speech for you mister spock i rather enjoy writing i dont get to do it often in this job\nplease feel free to change any words that you wish ive tried to make it sound vulcan a lot of unnecessarily long words in a few hours you will deliver this statement alongside our senate proconsul it will announce to the vulcan people that a peace envoy is on its way from romulus we will transmit it on all federation subspace frequencies\nactually three vulcan ships captain the enterprise is only aware of the one we stole from qual or two we have been following your investigation it has forced us to make some minor changes one of them a message sent in your name ordering them to stay where they are\nin that event the enterprise will be given more important matters to attend to in the meantime ambassador spock will be telling his people to welcome the peace envoy and when they do our forces will seize control before anyone realises what has happened\nof course it will and were fully prepared for it but we will be there entrenched and it will be very difficult to get us out once we are reunification will become a fact of life\nif you do not you will die all of you will die\ni hate vulcans i hate the logic i hate the arrogance very well computer holographic programme spock one by taking advantage of holographic sampling during the last several days we have created a programmable spock run programme\nfreeze we would have preferred an interactive spock who could have responded to questions but this will have to suffice\ni dont need to convince them just confuse them long enough to reach vulcan end programme if you ll excuse me its time to send our ships on their journey\nimpossible theres no way they could have gotten out of this room\nhow did you get in here\nceasefire holograms\nit doesnt matter what you do now spock s announcement will be made in minutes our forces will be on vulcan before you can alert anyone\nyoull never get out of this building\nyou have found him captain picard and now the conclusion\nwhat are you doing on romulus\nit is no concern of starfleet\nyou may assure your superiors captain that i am here on a personal mission of peace and i will advise starfleet when it is appropriate\nyou can not remain here captain picard\ncowboy diplomacy\nthat is precisely what i had hoped to avoid\nsarek sarek is dead walk with me picard\ni know of your mind meld with my father which enabled him to complete his last mission\nhe was a great representative of the vulcan people and of the federation\nemotional disarray was a symptom of the illness from which he suffered\nsarek would no more approve my coming here than you do picard for some time now ive been aware of a growing movement here of people who seek to learn the ideals of the vulcan philosophy they ve been declared enemies of the state but there are a few in the romulan hierarchy like par dek who are sympathetic he asked me to come now because he believes it may be time to take the first step toward reunification\nit would seem unlikely to succeed but i can not ignore the potential rewards that a union between our two worlds would bring\nthere is a new proconsul in the romulan senate he is young and idealistic he has promised many reforms par dek believes that he may be receptive to discussing reunification\na personal decision captain perhaps you are aware of the small role i played in the overture to peace with the klingons\nnot entirely it was i who committed captain kirk to that peace mission and i who had to bear the responsibility for the consequences to him and his crew quite simply i am unwilling to risk anyones life but my own on this occasion so i ask you respect my wishes and leave\nyou speak as my father would if he were here picard\ni was involved with cowboy diplomacy as you describe it long before you were born\nin your own way you are as stubborn as another captain of the enterprise i once knew\nthe senate has adjourned par dek will be here shortly\nthere are groups in every populated area ive personally spoken with members from four provinces it has become a serious concern for the romulan leadership\ni sense you have a closed mind captain closed minds have kept these two worlds apart for centuries in the federation we have learned from experience to view the romulans with distrust we can either choose to live with that enmity or seek an opportunity to change iti choose the latter\none can begin to reshape the landscape with a single flower captain\nthis is my friend dt an hes very curious about vulcan\nwhere did you get this this is very old\nyes i will\ni did not anticipate such a passionate response to my arrival\nif we are successful\nproconsul\ni am honoured\nthat is their loss i have found par dek to have a unique insight into many issues\nare you prepared to support reunification\nforgive me i did not expect to hear a romulan proconsul speak like a member of your underground\nand do you believe that you can gain the support of your full senate\nthey will be cautious there are generations of distrust to overcome\nas you wish\nit is more than we could have hoped for\ncaptain picard is correct it is not logical for the proconsul to support reunification at this time 2\ni came here to determine the potential for reunification in spite of what has occurred i intend to continue with my efforts i intend to meet with the proconsul as planned\non the contrary i am pursuing the most logical course\ni fear the influence of sarek has coloured your attitudes captain toward reunification and perhaps toward me\ncurious that i should hear him so clearly now that he is dead it is possible that i have brought my argument with sarek to you captain if so i apologise\nno it is not but it is true that i will miss the arguments they were finally all that we had\ni always had a different vision than my father the ability to see beyond pure logic he considered it weak but i have discovered it to be a source of extraordinary strengths are k would have seen this mission of reunification as a fools errand but somehow i think it is not logic can not explain why i know that i must pursue this\nif the romulans do have an ulterior motive it is in the interests of all concerned that we determine what it is so i will play the role that they would have me play\nmay i assist you commander i have had some experience in these matters\nthe romulans have incorporated a forty three part cipher key into their entry sequence\nhe intrigues me this picard\nremarkably analytical and dispassionate for a human i understand why my father chose to mind meld with him theres almost a vulcan quality to the man\nmore human\nfascinating you have an efficient intellect superior physical skills and no emotional impediments there are vulcans who aspire all their lives to achieve what you ve been given by design\nyes\ni have\ni believe i have isolated the twenty ninth cipher access code is hall attempt to access the proconsul s files\nplease\ni have no regrets\nyes fascinating\ni have been meeting with the proconsul\nhe speaks of nothing else\nthe syllabic nucleus of the vulcan language\nyour parents wanted you to learn to understand vulcan\nit means that the proconsul has apparently been attempting to deceive me for what purpose i can not say yet but his conversations with me have obviously been part of a greater plan which involves the stolen vulcan ship\nthe time the proconsul set for the subspace announcement of our peace initiative is fourteen hundred hours tomorrow one four zero zero\nyes you did\nit is the only logical conclusion you asked me to romulus you arranged the meetings with the proconsul and you knew that picard and data had returned to the surface with new information\ni will not read this or any other statement\nsince it is logical to conclude that you will kill us in any event i choose not to cooperate\ncommander data are they still unaware that we have access to their computers\nthen perhaps you and i can find a way to create a diversion\nim afraid i dont know too much about romulan disruptor settings\ncowboy diplomacy\nthis is ambassador spock of vulcan by now federation sensors are tracking three vulcan ships crossing the neutral zone these ships carry a romulan invasion force and must be stopped i repeat these ships carry a romulan\nnot bad\ncaptain i will not be coming with you\nthe reason for my coming here has never been more clear the union of vulcan and the romulan people will not be achieved by politics or by diplomacy but it will be achieved the answer has been here before us all along an inexorable evolution toward a vulcan philosophy has already begun like the first vulcans these people are struggling to a new enlightenment it may take decades even centuries for them to reach it but they will reach it and i must help\nnot at all captain i have found our arguments quite useful almost as useful as those i had with my father\nironically you may know sarek better than his own son does my father and i never chose to meld\nim afraid i dont see how a stolen vulcan ship fits into all this\nthe romulans could have a cloaked base on the surface\nwhat\nvulcan\nperhaps his reunification talks were successful\nthey destroyed their own invasion force\nami supposed to stand up and salute\nthank you thank you captain\nproconsul the senate has been recalled into session\nwhy would ner allie\nno this is our chance for acceptance finally to be heard 1\nwhat we have always done continue to teach pass on the ideals to a new generation work for the day when new thoughts may be spoken aloud\nsir the ship is locking phasers\ndo you know any klingon opera\nsurely you must know at least one theme from a ktu

second\ntheres no guarantee its going to fail captain id like your permission to remain here on the surface\nthank you captain\nlaforge here still breathing captain\nyou see captain i told you there was nothing to worry about\nweve spend years decades trying to avoid anything that would lead to a greenhouse effect and no where we are about to create one on purpose\nwhat now\nwed better get started before the res nothing left to mend\nlets hope all goes well\nsurface wind patterns over the target are stable\nall thermal monitoring stations are reporting no further temperature drops\nthank you thank you all youve given us what we need time\nwere fairly well quake proof down here picard its the volcanic dust im worried about\nno amount of co2 will help us then\nwe ve got particulate levels right where they re supposed to be and the sun is shining\nim getting in the habit of thanking you picard\ncommander riker\nwould you join me on the bridge please\nare you certain mister worf\nits too close to be a coincidence mister laforge\nwould a delay of one hour affect your plans\nthank you mister data\nensign bring the ship about lets take a look at mister worf s distortion\nthe lieutenants sensors detected a temporal distortion almost in our current course theres a small object back there that wasnt there a few moments ago\nfull stop ensign\non screen\nlife signs\ntry hailing it\nyes mister worf\nreply that the enterprise isnt going anywhere lieutenant\nwhat are you trying to tell me\nwho are you\nreally\nwhere exactly do you come from\nexactly what kind of historian are you\nyou cant expect me to believe that the layout of my ready room can possibly be of interest to future historians\nyou flatter me professor but i cant help but wonder what could possibly have caused you to select me as the subject of your study even in this decade there are far wiser and more experienced humans in and out of starfleet\ni realise that its difficult but we must keep to ourselves questions regarding the future go on professor\nmister data would you escort the professor to his quarters\nyou know everything i do will\nhe is human the medical scans have proved that right doctor\nand there was a temporal distortion back there correct mister worf\nand no one can deny that ship of his is unlike anything weve ever seen before\nmister worf i do appreciate your caution i share it bring his vessel into the shuttle bay place it under guard\ni realise that this visit is going to be difficult for some of us but ive examined his credentials and everything seems to be in order so i think we should extend to him every courtesy\nincluding questionnaires mister worf\nweve located three underground pockets of carbon dioxide here here and here our drilling phasers can release enough of the gas to form an envelope which would temporarily hold in the heat of the sun\nill notify doctor moseley good luck geordi\nwere glad to be of help doctor the enterprise will remain in orbit and continue to monitor your progress picard out\nensign return to synchronous orbit\nwhat kind of questions did he have for you number one\nlocation\nis laforge still down there\nfind him\nmagnify\nare you all right\non screen\nwhat about the dust\nthe mantle is collapsing where the pressure was released\nsort them out commander\nand look what weve done\nthe good news\nthat would be like striking a spark in a gas filled room\nturn the enterprise into a lightning rod\nand the bad news\nmeaning\ncome\ni imagine you know why ive asked you here\nim faced with a dilemma there is a planet beneath us which is slowly turning to ice and unless we do something about it im told that in a matter of weeks thousands may be tens of thousands will die\nyes it would it would be quite a shame\ncommander laforge has a possible solution the margins of error are extremely critical but if successful there ll be no more threat\nevery living thing on the planet will perish\nnot if you were to help me\noh no im not everything that starfleet stands for everything that i have ever believed in tells me i can not ask you that but at the same time there are twenty million lives down there and you know what happened to them what will happen to them\nwell ive never been afraid of reevaluating my convictions professor and now i have twenty million reasons to do so\nbecause your presence gives me potential access to a kind of information that ive never had available to me before and if i am to reexamine my beliefs then i must take advantage of every possible asset it would be irresponsible of me not to ask you here\nhow can you be how can you be comfortable watching people die\nyes professor i know what if one of those lives i save down there is a child who grows up to be the next adolf hitler or khan singh every first year philosophy student have been asked that question ever since the earliest wormholes were discovered but this is not a class in temporal logic its not theoretical its not hypothetical its real surely you see that\ni have two choices either way one version of history or another will wend its way forward the history you know or another one now who is to say which is better what i do know is here today one way millions of lives could be saved now isnt that incentive enough\nof course you know of the prime directive which tells us that we have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alien world snow i have sworn to uphold it but nevertheless i have disregarded that directive on more than one occasion because i thought it was the right thing to do now if you are holding onto some temporal equivalent of that directive then isnt it possible that you have an occasion here to make an exception to help me to choose because its the right thing to do\nevery choice we make allows us to manipulate the future doi ask adrienne or suzanne to the spring dance doi take my holiday on corsica or on risa a persons life their future hinges on each of a thousand choices living is making choices now you ask me to believe that if i make a choice other than the one found in your history books then your past will be irrevocably altered well you know professor perhaps i dont give a damn about your past because your past is my future and as far as im concerned it hasnt been written yet\nhow long will it take to programme the phasers number one\noh on the contrary professor you were quite helpful\nby refusing to assist me you left me with the same choice i had to began with to try or not to try to take a risk or to play it safe your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to choose is and because ive never been one to play it safe i choose to try mister data programme the firing sequence\nits time for you return to the ship mister laforge mister obrien standby to transport\nmister laforge you know better than anyone theres no guarantee this will work if it fails\npermission granted\ngood luck commander\nmister laforge\nreport back to the ship when your e ready commander doctor well stay in orbit and analyse the remaining volcanic disturbances but the best advice would be to let them cool down on their own\nim afraid were going to have to take a look in your vessel\na number of objects have been discovered missing in the last two days and if they re in your possession then we would like them returned\nbecause if i order data never to divulge what he sees in there he wont with the exception of anything that might belong to us\ntrying to make my history unfold in away other than it already has eh professor\nnow what possible incentive could anyone offer me to allow that\na pity you werent a bit more inventive if fewer things had disappeared we might never have suspected you as it was the only stumbling block was your ship our sensors couldnt penetrate it but once the door was opened the computer was able to detect and deactivate everything you d stolen including this\nim sure there are more than a few legitimate historians at starfleet who will be quite eager to meet a human from your era oh professor welcome to the twenty fourth century back to the episode listing star

larger than i thought\nwhere i come from every historian knows the bridge ofold1701d\nwhy earth late twenty sixth century earth to be ex active travelled back nearly three hundred years just to find you\nmy focus is on the twenty second through the twenty fourth centuries early interstellar history you know it was always believed this was on your desk not here fascinating dont move it on my account\nno less so than your legendary modesty captain if i could describe to you what a thrill it is to be here this is the original\nid love to tell you picardi really would but try and imagine what a young caesar might have done differently had someone had given him a hint of what lay ahead or if lincoln had been coerced into changing his theatre plans i truly wish i could be more specific on why you were selected but im afraid the exchange of information will have to flow in one direction only five six seven metres hai was right\noh i picked the right day all right just wait youll see do you always sit there on that side of the table\nits not important\nnow now commander you know better than that ive studied a great deal about your century including the fact that your e all quite aware of the dangers of anyone altering the past and thats exactly what id be doing if i were to divulge information like that\ni beg your pardon\nill be preparing questionnaires for each of you please complete them at your convenience if youre concerned about a possible breach of security im sure your captain can make a determination and thank you in advance for curbing your curiosity\nthis is really a thrill data like running across a redstone missile or a gutenberg bible to think the model to fan droids\nist and corrected\ni suppose it will have to do for no will get you a list of the things ill be needing okay\nit dbe best if you kept your assumptions to yourself wouldnt it\ni hope im not intruding\nas i promised here are your assignments im sure they ll be painless please try and complete them by tomorrow\nyour e all very calm\nhistory always records where people were what they were doing when important events took place but it rarely remembers their activities say a week before or a day or even an hour\ni didnt say that did i please just go on doing what you were doing and pretend im not here\nwere obviously very careful as a matter of fact a colleague and i recently paid a call on a twenty second century vessel\nisnt it fascinating how everyone has different interests when it comes to history different perspectives on progress\njust checking the time no problem\nno its nothing nothing what about you commander what do you see as the most important example of progress in the last two hundred years\nspoken like the consummate explorer\ni beg your pardon\nah you see doctor our klingon friend is a perfect example of what i was trying to tell you he views history through the eyes of a hunter a warrior his passion lies in the perfection of the tools of violence how delightfully primitive\nahha just the two im looking for ive brought you the forms i need you to complete shouldnt take any more than a couple of hours\nis that as fast as he can go\ntheres little known about datas efficiency almost nothing about his part in this mission its a topic of great conjecture\nit dbe best if you just thought of me as a fly on the wall and went about your business\ndata at pen thara four\nyour prosthesis what do you call it again\nvisor right avis or you know i have a picture of you wearing that in my office how do you like it\nyou know homer was blind and milton bach monet wonder\na fly on the wall\nwho said these moments were any less exciting when you know the outcome\nhave i missed much\nyouve given us what we need time\nvery clever picard and well done weve always known how you did it but to experience the moment to witness the nuances its indescribable\nthere you are well that certainly was exciting wasnt it\nyes couldnt be better thankyou i just thought we might chat about your questionnaire buck up crewman your e a credit to that uniform\nno please counsellor i would very much appreciate your remaining\ndoctor in response to my sixth question you spoke of a neural stimulator may i see one\nyou dont like me very much do you\nkeep your eyes wide soldier youll be telling your grandchildren how you were there at pen thara four but you dont trust me you should you know\npicard sem path wont trust you thats what they all said\nwere not that una like you and i you possess a sense that is foreign to the others my knowledge of the future is similar you know some of my best friends are em paths they trust me\nwere birds of a feather were colleagues we could learn a lot from each other\ni knew you d say that\nthank you\nyour e a very curious woman nono i dont mean curious like that i mean your e curious about things about beryl it e levels about the future\ni understand but your e different your e more vibrant more\nyou know whenever i travel back i meet very interesting people men and women but ive never anyone who gave me thoughts about not going home\nwhat in gods name is that\nmusic\ndo you think you could thin it out a bit\nhow the hell can you listen to four pieces of music at the same time\nonly four today\nwell i came to thank you for answering my questions though i probably should have asked you to limit yourself to fifty thousand words\ni realise its hard to believe data but very few records of doctor soon gs work survived to the twenty sixth century so it would be invaluable to myself and other historians if you could provide us with some schematics\nas long as its before oh nine hundred tomorrow thats when ill be heading back\nwhich do you suppose he s going to want to hear first\nyeah i have a fairly good idea\nthat dbe a shame\nso whats your dilemma\nand if its not successful\nso do nothing and thousands will die do something and millions could die thats a tough choice\nyour e not suggesting i tell you the outcome of your efforts\nso it seems you have another dilemma one that questions your convictions\nand why did you ask to see me\nhowever you come to terms with your beliefs captain i must tell you that im quite comfortable with mine\nlet me put it to you this way if i were to tell you that none of those people died you d easily conclude that you tried your solution and it succeeded so you d confidently try again no harm in that but what if i were to tell you they all died what then obviously you d decide not to make the same mistake twice now what if one of those people grew up\ni see it all too well but you must see that if i were to influence you everything in this sector in this quadrant of the galaxy could change history my history would unfold in away other than it already has now what possible incentive could anyone offer me to allow that to happen\neveryone dies captain its just a question of when all of those people down there died years before i was born all of you up here as well so you see i cant get quite as worked up as you over the fate of some colonists who for me have been dead a very very long time\nwere not just talking about a choice it sounds to me like your e trying to manipulate the future\nplease dont ask me captain i cant help you im sorry\nso youve made your choice after all and without my help\nhows that\nwell this is it\nlaforge remained below\nwell id love to see more but its nearly time for me to go i am tickled pink to have had the opportunity of witnessing this picard and you did it all without any help well must run got some packing to do you know your e taller in person commander\nwell would you look at this who would have expected a teary farewell\ncurious till the end eh captain you cant be serious picard we ve been through this more than once\nim not herein search of relics im sure they ll turn up\ni doubt you have the means\nconsidering the sensitive nature of my equipment i think youll understand if i request that only mister data be allowed to see it\nback in a minute\nnor does this this phaser is set at the highest stun setting if im correct that is sufficient to immobilise even you\nfar too valuable for that you see in the century i come from they havent even been invented yet\noh this is a time pod and it is from the twenty sixth century at least thats what the poor fellow said you see he decided to travel back to the twenty second century thats my time and he had the misfortune of meeting me his clothes fit quite well dont you think took me weeks to figure out how to work this thing\nmore of an inventor up till a few weeks ago a dismally unsuccessful one\nwell thanks to your captain it seems my intentions have changed slightly i was quite content with the notion of returning with those trinkets id invent about one a year but now look what fortune has graced me with you will take a little longer to figure out than a tricorder but it should be well worth the effort if the auto timer is programmed the way i think it is in about two minutes we should be on our way back to a place called new jersey im afraid you wont be awake for the ride\nthat weapon was working yesterday\nthis was all a misunderstanding picard just let me back in there and well forget the whole thing\ndoctor\nnot all of it some of it was real captain\nid love to hear more picard but i really must get back in that pod\nyou cant do this ive got to get back i dont belong here\nno\nwhat kind of drop can we expect\nand i doubt they re prepared to cope with the kind of cold thats coming\nyes sir\nright away sir\nmister w orfs what\ndimensions worf\nwhats odd\nprofessor at what point does time travel become a tool for historians\nwhat did he mean he picked the right day\ndeanna\nwhat if he san imposter god knows weve seen enough of them\nlook whos here\nno problem professor\nis there some reason we shouldnt be\nwhy is there no record of other future historians travelling back to witness important events\nwould you mind telling me what that is\nis something important supposed to be happening here\ni suppose the warp coil before there was warp drive humans were confined to a single sector of the galaxy\nwhat is going on are you expecting someone\nweve gotten word from the monitoring stations theyre all online were ready when you are geordi\nopen a channel mister worf and prepare to fire at target one\nmister data\nfire\ndata\nwhat have you got\nhow are the surface winds geordi\nyou should be getting something riker\nall he wanted to know about was previous starships what i thought was innovative about the last enterprise the one before that he said he wanted to see if we had a grasp of the fundamentals\nweve also got some volcanic activity pretty severe\ncaptain take a look at this these are the coordinates of the eruptions and these are the coordinates of the phaser drilling sites\nwe came here to help these people\ncaptain the electrostatic conditions are about as good as they re going to get if were going to try this nows the time\nweve just got to tie in geordi s atmospheric sensors\nyou have the

him off at starbase two one four\nits hard to tell but he is holding something back\nit might be that i dont know\nhes after more than a history lesson i can tell you that\ni dont know its like he s trying to confuse us misdirect us somehow\nive got some things to take care of\ni dont dislike you professor\nshould i\npicard sem path\nwhy should you care whether i trust you or not\nyour e right i

surface are charging captain\nthe test ship has successfully entered warp sir\nthe test ship is maintaining at warp two point three five sir\nno sir the effect has been localised to within two kilometres of the wavefront\nthat is four hundred and fifty percent more efficient than our own warp drive\nsir the waves power signature is fluctuating\nit is expanding toward us sir it appears to be interfering with our engines captain\nour last readings indicate the craft exploded due to extremes hearing stress\nsir sensors are coming back online\naye sir the wave is continuing on course for the lemma two colony it is bearing zero two zero mark three two nine\nsir the wave has increased in velocity to warp four point one\nsir the energy level of the wave has increased by a factor of twelve at this rate it will have increased by a factor of two hundred by the time it reaches lemma two\nbecause the soliton is constantly changing in both frequency and amplitude it will be extremely difficult to achieve an exact match\nwarp six point three seven\nthe wave has been growing in size as well as power there is insufficient time remaining for us to circumvent it before it reaches lemma two\nthe

in this sector we took the first transport and here we are\nno but i brought alexander with me i thought the two of you would like a chance to visit\ngood\nworf worf its so good to see you you look wonderful is that a touch of grey in your beard dont worry the ro zhen komen have always had beards of iron grey\ndid you see the look on alexanders face when he saw the play area hes going to love it here\nlapsang such ong tea please have you been eating you look thin\nwhen your father was in starfleet i always had to make sure that\nalexander is a fine boy worf hes smart and hes high spirited like you were at that age sometimes when he comes running through the house and knocks over that big green lamp just like you used to do\nwell maybe once when you werent looking when we learned alexander was to come to live with us we were so happy the house had been so empty since you left and we though there is our chance to fill it with the sound of children again but the truth is worf your father and i were getting old\ni dont mean were ready for the grave not yet anyway but were a little less active its harder for us to keep up with alexander were ready to be just grandparents alexander needs to be with his father\nhe needs his father worf alexander shes having difficulties\nhes disobedient\ni do know something about how klingon children behave its not just his willful attitude he doesnt always tell the truth\nhe is a boy worf and boys sometimes take the wrong path they need guidance he needs a father his father to give him that guidance i have to leave so on the transport will be leaving for earth you must do what you think is best for him thats all a parent can hope to do\ntwenty three field coils working in concert will generate the soliton wave from this point on the planet surface we will have our test ship to wed to a position approximately two million kilometres from bilan a three if our theories are correct the wave will envelop the ship and push it into warp\nthe soliton emits a great deal of subspace radio interference youll need to remain within twenty kilometres in order to receive telemetry\nthe wave will be directed toward lemma two about three light years distance our sister facility there which will generate a scattering field which will dissipate the wave and bring the ship out of war pill be sending you more detailed operational plans within the hour\ncaptain were ready to begin the launch sequence\nthis is doctor jada r to all stations you may begin the launch sequence\nthank you captain\ncaptain are you all right was anyone hurt\nthe preliminary data we received indicate a transient power imbalance\nare you still tracking the wave\nwell i hope your e here to see it next time we try mister laforge\nhave you checked the frequency resonance of the subspace\ncommander at that energy level the wave will not only destroy the colony itll take most of the planet with it\ncome in lieutenant worf very nice to see you again and you must be alexander i hear you ll be coming to school with us for awhile well were very excited to have you with us i know the other boys and girls will be happy to have a new classmate first i need to get a little information from you lets start with your name alexander roz henk o thats a tough one maybe you can help me with that could you spell your last name for me\nit doesnt matter i think i can figure it out date of birth\nill get the rest of his personal records from the school on earth and oh one last question how long will he be staying aboard ship\nkyle to lieutenant worf\nim sorry to bother you again lieutenant but i forgot to mention that we need to arrange for a series of placement examinations for alexander if you could tell me when\nas the value of their horns increased the number of white rhinos in the wild kept falling until they finally became extinct about two centuries ago now id like to show you a pair of animals were trying to save from extinction would you follow me theyre from cor van two where their homes in the rain forests are being threatened by industrial pollutants they recalled cor van gil vos theyre a little shy\nthe eating habits of gil vos are very similar to those of earths draco lizards which died out over three hundred years ago there are only fourteen gil vos left on cor van two were transplanting these two to the protected planet brent alia where they should thrive well why dont you all have a look around on your own for awhile if you have any questions please feel free to ask\nalexander im sorry i forgot to tell everyone that the models on the tables were for everyone to play with so i guess you didnt know you werent supposed to take them i saw you playing with the lizard model a little while ago do you still have it\nlieutenant worf i can only tell you that\nlieutenant i saw alexander put the model inside of his jacket lieutenant worf personal log stardate 453768 alexander has acted shamefully and as his father i must now deal with him but i find that i would gladly fight ten armed baldur warriors rather than face one small child\nits quite all right please sit down\nlieutenant your son is a very bright very spirited young man from his test scores im sure hell turn out to be one of my best students however from his behaviour in class so far i do have some concerns\nfrankly hes defiant hes overly aggressive toward the other students and he has a great deal of difficulty paying attention\nand he seems to still have difficulty telling the truth he takes toys from other the other students and then denies taking them he acts like a bully and then says someone else started the fight and hes bluntly told me you said klingons do not listen to teachers\nno of course not hes acting on his internal feelings and then making up stories to explain them it might be a good idea for the two of you to sit down with counsellor troi and\nlieutenant i think we should\ndata data isnt this exciting we are going to witness a moment in history\nnon on ono i mean were going to see something that people will talk about for years i mean think about it no more bulky warp engines or nacelles a ship just generates a soliton wave and then rides it through space like a surfboard this is going to be like being there to watch chuck yeager break the sound barrier or z ephram cochrane engage the first warp drive\nim talking to the wrong crowd donaldson donaldson your e an engineer\ni hope so commander\nlink established receiving prelaunch telemetry now\nthe soliton wave has been initiated its heading for the test ship\ntelemetry looks good soliton wave is steady\nthats a little faster than they anticipated but still well within mission parameters\nenergy transfer is ninety eight percent\nyes sir theres less than a two percent energy loss between the wave and the ship\nwave efficiency has dropped to seventy three percent\ni cant compensate for it\nsensors and warp drive are offline deflectors down to fifteen percent\nthat would be consistent with our telemetry readings from the ship we detected a sudden drop in transfer efficiency just before the explosion\nnot he explosion damaged our main sensor array but i think well have it repaired in a couple of hours\ndoctor you did it warp without warp drive for a while there it was really something to see\nso do i doctor\ni need another hour commander i still have to replace three power couplings\nthe soliton wave has continued to increase in\nthe soliton wave has continued to increase in power its energy level has risen by a factor of ninety six at its current rate of acceleration the wave should hit the planet in a couple of hours\nwell there are two possibilities we could attempt to use our own warp engines to generate an inverse resonance wave if we could match the exact frequency and amplitude of the soliton we should be able to neutralise it\nits a little more dangerous but i think theres a better chance for success we could create a backfire an explosive force set off just in front of the soliton wave a large enough explosion say five photon torpedoes should be enough to disrupt the wave and allow it to dissipate\nthe good news is we can catch it the bad news is that in order to setup this backfire we have to be in front of it data\nwe lost four warp transfer conduits commander\ni doubt that i can keep this speed up\nmuch longer commander you d better fire those torpedoes while were still in front of the wave\ncome mister worf i thought our meeting was scheduled for eleven hundred hours\ni see well mister worf as your e aware several new security officers will be transferring to the enterprise next week and i would like to discuss\ni would like to discuss with you the specific areas of ships security that i would like\nmister worf you are not the first officer on this ship to have a new family member take care of yours on the security matters can

primary school teachers he told me you enrolled alexander in her class this morning\nim sure hell do very well shes a wonderful teacher\ndid she tell you about the father son field trip this afternoon\nwhy not\nthis would be a good opportunity for you to meet some of the other students and parents\ngood ill let them know your e coming\nworf\ni just wanted to know how the field trip went yesterday\nno why\nmay i ask how\ni see sometimes these things are nt over as quickly as they seem to be id be happy to help if you have any further problems\nare you sure this is what you want\nhave you discussed this with alexander\ni see\nim not here to approve or disapprove of the way you raise your son my concern right now is how this decision is going to affect you how will you feel when alexanders gone\nis that how you felt when he left to live with your parents\ni understand the idea of raising a child can seem a tremendous burden particularly to a solitary parent\ni see have you ever wondered how alexander felt about being sent away\ndo you think he felt abandoned after all he left very soon after kehl e yrs death in a way he not only lost his mother he lost his father as well\nits possible children dont have the experience to handle emotional crises instead of dealing with their feelings they act on them tell me about the last time you spoke with kehl e yr the night she died\nwhat about\nso you were angry with her\nare you still angry with her\nit would be very normal to be angry with her angry because she died and left you alone with a son you never knew you had being angry doesnt mean you loved her any less worf but you cant hide from your feelings just as alexander can not hide from his you both have a lot of healing to do perhaps you should think about doing it together\nvery exciting\ntransfer the signal to this station\nmother\nis father with you\nvery well i will make arrangements for you to come aboard\nhello alexander\nit is good to see you both how long can you stay\nmother why does alexander believe he is remaining\nmother\nmother we need to talk about alexander\ni dont remember you smiling when i knocked over that lamp\nmother you both have many years\nmother that is not possible we must find another option\ndifficulties\nmother klingon children are often difficult to control\nmy son is a liar\ndid you enjoy going to school on earth\ndid you like your teachers\ngood i understand you lived in my old room\ngood\nalexander the teacher asked you a question\nyes yes of course\nit has not been decided\ni apologise for being late captain i was detained in school i was enrolling my son in class\nworf here\nthis is not a good time i will contact you shortly miss kyle sorry captain\nyes doctor\ni would rather discuss this at a later time\nthank you captain\nyes\ngood\nyes we can not attend\ni have a personnel review scheduled at thirteen hundred hours\ni might be able to reschedule the review\nare you accusing him of stealing\nalexander did you take the model of the lizard from the table\na klingons honour is more important to him than his life a klingon would gladly face the most horrible punishment rather than bring shame or disgrace to his family name his word is his bond without it he is nothing do you understand\nwhy did you lie to me\ndid you fear the punishment you would receive\nyou dont know why you lied and yet you did you dont know why you stole and yet you did alexander come here when i was a child younger than you i lost my parents my family my people everything i had was taken from me except my sense of honour it was the one thing i had which was truly klingon and which no one could take away do you know who they are\nand his brother morath they fought for twelve days and twelve nights because morath had broken his word and brought shame to his family when you lie or steal you not only dishonour yourself but your family you dishonour me\ni accept your word we will not speak of this matter again\ncounsellor\nyou have not heard\nbridge there was an incident alexander stole a small model and then told a falsehood but i have remedied the situation\ni pointed out his error told him about kahless and morath and explained the value of honour the boy understood\nthank you that will not be necessary alexander will not repeat this mistake\nincoming message from doctor jada r\nseveral injuries reported on deck twenty seven no fatalities\nincoming message from bilan a three captain\ni apologise i was detained\nthank you\nwhat sort of concerns\nperhaps you do not have experience dealing with klingon children they require a firm hand\ni did not tell him that\ncomputer where is alexander roz henk o\ni will handle this\ncomputer what programme is being run\ncomputer freeze programme\nyes i saw why are you here\nbut you did not ask permission to take my bat leth or permission to use the holodeck\ni also said i wanted you to obey your teachers and keep your promise to mems kyle has told me about your behaviour about your lies\nalexander do not continue to\ni will not listen to more lies return to our quarters\nnot now not after you have broken your word\nenough it is now clear to me that i have failed in my duties as your father you have no understanding about what it means to be klingon i will arrange for you to attend a klingon school there you will learn the lessons i have failed to teach you\nwould you further dishonour our family with your disobedience\nyou will go to our quarters and remain there until i return\nit is not a question of what i want it is a question of what is best for the boy he will be better off at a klingon school\nhe is a child i informed him of my decision\nyou disapprove\ni will be pleased that he is receiving the guidance he requires\nthat was different at the time i felt he needed a home a family things i could not provide for him\nhe was no burden i simply knew that a klingon child required more attention than i could provide\nhe was very young im sure he was confused\nare you saying that his misconduct is a result of feeling abandoned\nwe argued\nalexander about how she did not tell me about him when he was born\nyes\nof course not\nalexander\nstop for a moment let us talk\ni want you to understand why you are going away\nyou do not understand im concerned about your future a klingon school will be a better environment for you\nthat is not true\nalexander if your mother were here i do not think she would want us to fight like this\nacknowledged remain here i will return shortly\nexcuse me\nthe

with that\nyes but we will discuss that at a later time\nklingon schools are designed to be difficult the physical and mental hardships faced by the students are meant to build character and strength

recall everything you heard people say aboard the vico before it was destroyed\nsir drop the shields\ncaptain drop the shields\nour own shields caused the increases in the wavefronts sir we have been

know about five i guess it was before i got the first visor and it was only a couple of minutes before my parents found me and pulled me out and nobody got hurt but i tell you that was the longest couple of minutes of my life it was a while after that before i could even let my parents get out of earshot it was like i absolutely needed to know that they were there you know\nyeah\nmagnetic residual analysis confirms that the vico was attacked inside the black cluster the graviton wavefronts pushed the ship to where we found it\nno sir torsional stress levels point to a disrupter style

i dont think were going to find anything\nlaforge to data\ni need your help with the shield modulators\nto get anywhere near the centre were going to have to push through the gravitational wavefronts

greater than you were indicating\nyou tend to underestimate humans my brother praising young wesley on the helm for example lore\nhe has a childs body but we have found him to be much more\neverything available on a doctor noon ien soong\nbut he had destroyed his own reputation by making what seemed wild promises about his positronic brain design almost all of which failed\nif you get one the way i did lore it will mean four years at the academy another three as ensign tenor twelve on varied space duty in the lieutenant grades\nhow\nand will we also discuss lore which of us was constructed first\nyou lived with the colonists\nquite true i keep trying to be more human and keep failing\nand do you realise lore that i am obligated to report all of this to our ships captain\nuse it also to describe for the captain the time you spent among the colonists including everything you know about what happened to them\nthank you lore i now have duties to perform unless of course you need something more\nto go\nwhich is used in our construction that particular compound is no more suspicious sir than a human looking for an antiseptic or an ointment nevertheless i should check it out\nchampagne\ni have some doubts about the value of human customs in this my brother\ni will function sufficiently to stop lore doctor\nhow sad dear brother you make me wish i were an only child\ni will stay with wesley doctor\nwest he transporter\nwesley now\nyes sir im fine\nyes captain\nsir we are now twenty minutes from omicron theta mark\naye sir\napproaching close parking orbit sir\nnow in close parking orbit sir\nagreed sir the soil appears almost completely lifeless\nthis once was rich farmland id say something like twenty to thirty years ago\ncommander id say that everything on this planet was either dead or dying at the time data was found\ncommander i think ive got this place figured out here this was really very cleverly done to make this look like a natural hollow in the terrain here there are signs of it being constructed in a hurry as if to hide something here\nyeah thought so\ndoctor noon ien soong my friend happens to have been earths foremost robotics scientist\ndata its you\ncommander riker looks like some sort of storage area\nlooks like just these two i mean that and the real data\nwill we know how to turn it on\nagreed captain\nwell to make it easier for humans to relate to you had to be but your designer may have had something else to prove as well\nand helm control is here with the ships heading given in measurements we call degrees three hundred and sixty of them in a full circle this way\non the nose\nmy brother that has a nice sound to it data\ncaptain im picking up a bogey coming in on a five oclock tangent\nits like a giant snowflake crystal but much more complex the entire electromagnetic spectrum seems to play about inside it but i havent the slightest idea what it is sir\nnow i call that communicating\nhe was but they found him imperfect and i was made to replace him you may call me lore\nthen you say mark\nso by ordering a heading so many degrees this way and so many this way the ship can travel in any direction all three dimensions\nhave i committed an offence\nyour every clever wesley i now have duties to perform correct\nbecause i was designed to be so human my brother i enjoy pleasing humans\nits not important\nhe didnt seem that clever ill be more careful\nthankyou for that information too you do care about how i perform i pledge to be worthy of your teaching my brother try not to be jealous of my abilities\nwhat information are you requesting\ngood old often wrong soong a joke brother actually he was a genius by human standards\npromises he later proved to be true which made you and me possible brother our beloved father will iso on have a uniform like that brother\na system designed to compensate for limited human ability and you brother are beginning to think as a human you andi are completely different from them are you truly satisfied with the knowledge and memory of a few hundred human colonists suppose it could reflect thousands or millions or the knowledge of hundreds of millions of life forms of every kind\nwe will discuss that in time\nit would be foolish to underestimate you brother yes i lied when i said you were made first but with good reason doctor soong made me perfect in his first attempt but he made me so completely human the colonists became envious of me\nuntil they petitioned soong to make a more comfortable less perfect android in other words you brother havent you noticed how easily i handle human speech i use their contractions for example i say cantor isnt and you say can not or is not i say tomato you say tomah to isay potato you say pot ah to a very old joke but then you also have trouble with their humour ami right\ndo you realise brother i can help you become more human\ni assumed as much when i began studying you may i use this to learn more of this vessel and its customs\ni promise a report of great detail and accuracy\ni have more than i dreamed possible brother captains log stardate 412425 thanks to lores report we now know what happened to the colonists beginning with a childs drawing enhanced by lores description our computer has constructed the image of a great crystalline entity which feeds on life insatiably ravenous for the life force found in living forms capable of stripping all life from an entire world\nlesson number one in becoming more human you must observe all human customs\nan ancient ritual still practiced when they celebrate events of importance my brother i toast our discovery of each other may it fill our lives with new meaning\nand let us toast also doctor soong who gave me the full richness of human needs and ambitions a perfect match for my mind my body\nand let us toast also the great crystal entity with whom i learned to communicate before doctor soong disassembled mei earned its gratitude by revealing the way to the colonists can you image its gratitude when i give it the life on this vessel\ncrystal entity upon arriving here you can identify me as the machine named data end of message come in please\nglad you are here wesley lore suddenly attacked me and i had to turn him off\nhe discovered we have been using sensors to follow what he does i practiced his facial tic do i have it right\nyes i do use language more formally than lore please inform the captain i will come up to the bridge and report on this\na change of mind doctor if i can not trust the bridge crew whom can i\nbeautiful isnt it\ni will have to examine him to know sir\nwesley is only showing himself to be alert and responsible something to encourage come you can watch everything i do\nbe careful of lore good he is still unconscious notice the same twitch even though he is unconscious stay back we may have problems if he senses someone else is near lore i have a few questions to ask you\nlore it is data he senses you i can not control him if you stay please i will record everything he says\nand you want to be as stupid as them dear brother\nno captain let me talk to it\nopen hailing frequencies crystal form i identify myself as data advising you to stop your attack the humans here are powerful capable of injuring or even destroying you\nsuggest moving fast to confirm what it old it sir permission to use the large transporter in cargo room three there i can be am up some living pattern perhaps a large tree\nsir\nemergency close\nnow show me your warrior fierceness\ncrystal

little man into a torch i promise him exquisite pain unless you obey me too brother\ndo you see now the advantages of being completely human it includes kindness i give you your life doctor go home quickly and i may not injure your son at all\ngo or hell be shrieking by the count of five one two three four\nthankyou for my human quality doctor soong wait a small payment for your sons

think so really i wonder which of them was made first\nim also a bit troubled by it describing you as imperfect\ni wonder but the point of this is whether you and it have approximately the same capabilities\ni see your point my apologies\nand you have about equal physical strength and mental abilities\nwhich requires i now ask you a very serious question since the two of you are closely related to each other\nthank you commander i was certain of that\nwhich explains why data could be left outside in no danger from that creature whatever happened to the colonists he would be found by the first starfleet crew that responded to the signal he transmitted\nwith so little of even our galaxy explored i find it at least possible\nits the act of a starfleet officer obeying his captain

for both compounds\nbile nium and tarr i site are not present\ndard ilion contains the byproduct nili zene sensors do not routinely scan for that substance\nthere is non i liz ene on the enterprise\nis that good\nthat is remarkable you remembered such vivid detail\ncaptain mister tar min gave us a demonstration of his abilities this afternoon its fascinating perhaps you would like to resurrect some memories\nim sure you d be ideal and you must have some intriguing memories\nany change doctor martin\nive tried standard revival techniques she doesnt respond until i find out whats caused this i dont want to try anything more extreme\nno she was found in her quarters this morning when she didnt show up for an appointment she was dressed for bed but the bed hadnt been slept in\nill check the biofilter readings from the ulli an transporter log its possible they could still be carrying a harmful organism\nwill will i promise ill let you know the minute that she regains consciousness\ntheres nothing you can do here youll wear yourself out\ni compared deanna s brains can to one that i took during her last physical there is a difference this time theresa trace of electro path ic activity\ni found the same pattern if i didnt know better id say they both had i resin e syndrome thats the only medical condition that would produce that pattern\na very rare neurological disorder first diagnosed in the twenty third century its characterised by an identical electro path ic residue\nire sine is always accompanied by a severely decreased histamine count both will and deanna showed normal levels ive asked commander laforge to conduct a ship wide diagnostic to determine any other agent that might cause the same electro path ic pattern\nthats true but there is something curious the electro path ic residue i discovered is located in the thalamus thats the area of the cerebral cortex that involves memory function\nin further study of the victims i detected some abnormal patterns in the area of the brain that involves memory\nif i could do further examinations tomorrow perhaps monitor you during a memory probe\nthank you ill contact you in the morning\nyour e the only person on board to undergo a memory probe by the ulli an sid like to do a neurological work up and see if i can detect any residual effect doctor martin will monitor your vital signs while i conduct the scan\nhave you had any unusual symptoms since the probe headaches dizziness\nelectrical activity is normal levels are normal hippocampus is stable and the thalamus the thalamus is normal there is no indication at all of the electro path ic residual\noh you refine keiko but i am no closer to solving this mystery\nno thanks i was just doing some reading on their e

come\ni have to face the fact that he s gone\nits good of you to come with me\nthey have been in contact with us already thank you\nit is perplexing to me that the ulli ans ability to retrieve memory is so highly prized if an event were important enough to be recovered why would it have been forgotten\nthat is correct\nmy understanding of the human brain suggests that the process is the same for you each memory is encoded in chains of molecules if you want to retrieve it you simply access the proper sequence\nthen in what way is it different\nperhaps you remember the pleasant memories and forget the unpleasant ones\nit would seem there is no predictable pattern to human memory\nfour days eleven hours\ni assume from your tone of voice that you were unsuccessful\nemergency medical team

assault\nsurely you would give us the chance to prove that we are innocent\nthen i would propose doing a memory probe of counsellor troi you have said that she doesnt remember anything that happened before she lapsed into unconsciousness i could retrieve that memory there is a possibility that it could explain the coma and prove our innocence\ncounsellor whats the last thing you remember the other night\nwould you get your hairbrush\ntell me about brushing your hair do you do it every night\nwhat is it\nsomeones with you in the room\ngo on\nsome things happening\ngo back into that memory

centuries ago\ni dont know a perverse source of pleasure perhaps a way to exercise control over another\nmy father has never been one to admit that he s wrong but it is difficult to believe hed be capable of this i am told that the punishment for this crime is quite severe we are monitoring my fathers telepathic activities you have my assurance he wont assault anyone else i am sorry for this captain\nwell be reaching starbase soon i wanted to say goodbye and to apologise again for my father\nbefore all this happened i had hoped we might become friends\nafter what he s put you through maybe you can forget im not sure i can you re so lovely i have to go goodbye\nno\nwhy do you have to be so nice so lovely\nyour e so beautiful so fragile\nhave you stopped thinking about us\nits a chipped cup off white with a crack initi can see it but i dont remember anything else about it\nno i dont think so wait yes humming someones humming\nyes but i dont know who it is\nit has a sharp edge where its chipped\na liquid dark\nits not hot its bitter\nyes a wooden handle\nno its more delicate than that\na brush an ink brush i hear that humming again\nit soba a chan my grandmother shes doing ink brush writing i can remember it now she used that cup for cleaning the brushes and it was my job to fill it with water and bring it to the table i would sit beside her and watch the most beautiful characters come from that brush and the whole time shed be humming to herself i remember it like it was yesterday\nfor years ive seen that old cup in my memory but i could never remember what it was or why it was important thank you\nits getting late id better be going\nim happy to help\nno nothing like that it was a wonderful experience\nis that good\nhow about you commander got any memories you feel like digging up\nits not quite the same for us as it is for you data you record every second of every moment of your life\nand then if you want to recall any one of those moments you just access the proper memory circuit\nyeah thats true\nsometimes there are memories we just cant access at the spur of the moment for instance i have no recollection of how i spent my last birthday birthdays are important occasions and you would think that id remember how i spent the day but right now i cant even remember where i was\ndeck two on the other hand i remember everything about the time i got my first peta circassian cat i was eight i remember how funny looking he was i remember how excited i was its as if it happened last week\nno sometimes the bad memories can be the most intense of all\nit would seem\ni dont think so thanks anyway\ncommander i need to bring that door down\ncommander radiation levels are critical we ve got to seal it off\ni need to bring that door down\nive got to get that isolation door down\ni need that door down\ncomputer locate the electro path ic pattern described in medical database four delta one\nokay were going to track down any possible cause of that brain pattern first what are the medical conditions that might account for it\nright and doctor crusher already eliminated that so how many non medical forces or substances might cause the pattern\nokay and how many of those are present on the enterprise\nare the ships sensors calibrated to detect all those agents\nokay lets start with the chemical substances name them\nferraz ene has a complex molecular structure it breaks down into bile nium and tarr i site do the sensors scan for those\nand are they present on the enterprise\ndo any of the substances break down into byproducts that are not scanned for\nwell this isnt a routine situation scan for the nili zene\nhow did i know you were going to say that okay lets move onto the non chemical agents\nive spent two hours having a cozy chat with the computer ive checked everything i can think of any possible agent that might cause that electro path ic pattern\ndidnt find a thing\ndoctor crushers not going to be too happy with\ndoctor crusher had me working on a ship wide diagnostic id gone to give her the results when i found her\nnone ive checked and cross checked theyre just dead ends\nif one of them is behind this will keeping telepaths in their quarters prevent it from happening again\nwell thats it for melina two no unexplained comas during the time the ulli answer e working there\nmaybe or maybe were not checking for the right thing\nwe have nt look into the comas that were explained\nwell remember what doctor crusher said right after counsellor troi became unconscious that it looked exactly like i resin e syndrome except for the histamine count\nmaybe not every medical facility is as careful as doctor crusher maybe its easier to just make a quick diagnosis rather than to keep hunting for the real cause\nright and correlating them with visits by the ulli ans and there we are\nlets check the other planets i think we may have something here\nwe just got the transmission from the nel system data no mention of ire sine syndrome but there are two unexplained comas on one planet none on the other\nchecking the mission logs thats funny on stardate s45321and45323 when the comas occurred tar min was on his home plane the wasnt anywhere near the nel system\nno im still getting unusual neurotransmitter readings in the diencephalon but they might be a result of the coma\nanything more i can do for you\nany luck\nokay ill see you tomorrow\nsickbay to captain picard\ncounsellor troi has regained consciousness shes asked for you sir\nthree days\nrather like the ancient oral historians on earth\nim sure however i dont think i would make a particularly good subject\nyes well\nmister data\ncan you bring her out of it\nwho was the last person to speak with her\nask if they would consent to an examination just to be certain\nbridge to commander riker picard to commander riker answer please computer locate commander riker\nand commander riker\nwhy discount the possibility that its responsible for these com as\ni believe that it would be premature to take that action mister worf theres no real evidence linking these comas with the ulli ans\ni mean no disrespect but we are faced with an alarming situation\nsuspect is perhaps too strong a word im simply trying to determine what has caused two of my officers to fall into com as\nin light of your telepathic abilities it raises the question\nyou shouldnt remember him like this\nyou dont have to do this\nits the least i can do\nyou shouldnt remember him like this\nyou shouldnt remember him like this\nits the least i can do\nits the least i can do\ndid your scans provide any insights into these com as\nmister data i want you to investigate those eleven planets that the ulli ans visited see if there were any reports of unexplained com as\nin the meantime we must consider restricting them to their quarters as a precautionary measure\nwhat else can we do station a guard set up a force field i dont see that those would be any more effective\npicard here\nim on my way\nwhat is the last thing you do remember\nand then\nwe were hoping that you could tell us\nyou were the first the next day commander riker fell into a similar coma last night doctor crusher\nwere not certain it may be that there is some unusual effect produced by the ulli ans telepathic activity im going to talk to them and in the meantime youre to stay here and recuperate and if you remember anything at all about what happened i want you to tell me immediately\nthat you voluntarily confine yourself to your quarters at least until we have unraveled this mystery\nno please dont look on it like that we have done everything we can to explain these com as we have performed physical examinations and neurological scans we have conducted a ship wide diagnostic looking for viruses parasites infestations we have investigated every possible cause we can imagine we have found nothing nothing to explain these com as the only variable that we have not been able to eliminate is your presence here on this ship now in the light of our actions we would ask you to understand my request and to agree to it\ni know that\nim simply considering all possibilities\nif thats possible of course\nim sorry i couldnt possibly subject counsellor troi to a potentially dangerous procedure\nno\ni will discuss the matter with counsellor troi\ncounsellor i want to reiterate if you have any doubts whatsoever about this procedure you dont have to go through with it\nvery well\nim not sure we have any legal basis for such a prosecution memory invasion is simply not a crime weve ever had to contend with\nwhat could motivate someone like your father to commit such an act\nyour father claims quite strenuously that he is innocent\npicard to commander data\nhows your search coming\nwell inform the medical personnel on those planets that we have discovered the true nature of the comas im sure theyll appreciate knowing what\nreally happened\nearth was once a violent planet too at times the chaos threatened the very fabric of life but like you we evolved we found to find better ways to handle our conflicts but i think no one can deny that the seed of violence remains within each of us we must recognise that because that violence is capable of consuming each of us as it consumed your son back to the episode listing star trek and related

say that even when someone sin a coma they may be able to hear when people talk to them that it might help stimulate the brain speed the healing in fact i think you did that for me once when i was in

    "episode 111": "enterprise i am aaron conor\ni dont want to be rude captain but we dont wish to interact with outsiders im only responding because of your warning\nyes i know we have been tracking it but our biosphere has been constructed to withstand quakes of eight points even on the richter scale\nevacuate that is not possible there must be an alternative\nour environment is sealed no one can get in or out\nmatter energy\nreally thats quite remarkable\nnoi must stay here but under the circumstances i will permit a small delegation from your ship inside the biosphere if only to see this matter energy transportation you speak of\ngood lord martin what would you have me do\nwe have nothing to hide\nits them look at this martin\nnot just reluctant miss troi it is imperative that we remain\nyou see this is an engineered society\ngenetically engineered our ancestors came from earth to develop a perfect society they believed that through controlled procreation they could create people without flaws and those people would build a paradise\neight generations of us\nthank you martin perhaps youve also made it clear there are still a few imperfections were working on for the most part weve achieved a fully integrated existence not just among ourselves but with our environment we dont just live here were a part of our environment it is part of use very plant life every microscopic life form is part of a master design we can not separate ourselves from it without irreparably altering who and what we are\nif we do not survive the balance of our society wont mean a great deal will it\ni apologise but he is performing his function as he is designed to do\nhe is the interpreter of our founders intentions for this society\nyes more or less obviously he has no diplomatic talents\ni have been bred to fill this specific role we grow up knowing exactly what our society needs from us what we are expected to do\nnot at all my entire psychological make up tells me that i was born to lead i am exactly what i would choose to be think of it another way are there still people in your society who have not discovered who they really are or what they were meant to do with their lives they may be in the wrong job they may be writing bad poetry or worse yet they may be great poets working as labourers never to be discovered that does not happen here it is for us an ideal existence we will not give it up easily\nhannah id like you to meet our guests\nhannah bates is one of our scientists if there s any way to shore up our defences hannah will find it she has a remarkable talent with theoretical physics\nnono that would be fine id like you to see it\ndisruptive you mean what martin was saying\ntoo late the damage is done\ni sometimes think that strict interpreters like martin have forgotten were still human well adjust accommodate\nour geneticists are able to screen out any congenital health risks before conception our population is diverse enough to maintain a genetic balance in the event of accidental death but very little that is unexpected occurs here ami making this sound incredibly dull\nill tell you the truth but ill deny it if you tell martin ive found today exhilarating meeting you meeting new people with new ideas\na student of human nature\na him afraid you wouldnt find much work here counsellor\nwell in that case i shall have to have them build one\nno one had ever come here and no one had ever left until today this is a date to note in our history books\ni dont think they intended us to die martin\ntemporarily the

do we tell our children such ghastly stories\nwe are every bit as fragile as an egg and as impossible to reconstruct we are integrated and refined to such a degree that any fundamental change would lead to chaos\nyou have helped you ve been wonderful these past few days you ve been my counsellor\nfriends that just wont do either\nwill it\ni must confess a part of me knows that if i transport

doesnt have to happen again\nengineering crews\nis there any other choice\nyes captain\ni can not adequately express my appreciation to your crew is hannah able to hear me\nthis is an historic achievement hannah youve done a wonderful thing for our people\nwe look forward to honouring you appropriately when you return thank you again captain conor out captains log supplemental the stellar core fragment has passed safely out of the moab system the colony was shaken by powerful temblor s but fortunately there were no injuries and only minor damage was reported\nthey ve been invaluable commander thank you again\nwould you tell deanna troi for me that im sorry i didnt have the opportunity to say goodbye personally\na breach in the biosphere get hannah bates\nhow long do we have hannah\nmartin\ni want to talk with captain picard alone\nthank you martin\nthe irony is hes the one who saw this coming from the moment you arrived because i didnt want to hear it i chose not to listen\nnono i wish it were that simple but i cant for give myself so easily you see captain i know what hannah bates is feeling ive been feeling it as well ive found your people intriguing and stimulating as she has ive been every bit as curious about you as the next man but i am not the next man i am the leader of these people and every genetic fibre in my being demands that i protect them instead i have betrayed them i have allowed this to happen\nthen let us both find a way to stop it from going any further\npicardi was born to govern this colony not to dismantle it\nif even a handful leave the damage to this society will be devastating what about the rights of those who would stay behind they are the ones who will inherit the social chaos that will follow for generations your arrival created this problem your departure solves it\nrefuse them passage\nnor can you ignore the fact that thousands will suffer if you agree to take them and as suffering grows more will demand to leave we are witnessing the end of this existence i implore you captain do not let this happen\ncaptain picard has decided to grant transport to any individuals who wish to leave genome colony im asking you to stay\nthe experiences of the past week will become part of our heritage we will adjust in a few generations we will be able to\ngive me six months just wait six months before you leave\nhannah this is your home we are all in a sense your family dont we deserve an opportunity to open a dialogue on this issue at the very least i am only asking for six months\nwhen your e ready to come home you will be welcome\nattempt to assess the damage spend the rest of my life on the near impossible task of rebuilding this society without the proper pieces\ni replay each step of this in my mind looking for the wrong turn the mistake in judgement i can find only one and as hard as i try i can not regret even that one in fact im quite certain that given the opportunity i would choose to make the same mistake again i can only wonder why with all the hundreds of genetically compatible women i would fall in love with you\nperhaps its your imperfections which make you so unique but i am in love with you deanna troi and i will always be\nacknowledged commander riker\nthe society is genetically integrated suddenly there would be gaps missing pieces\nthere must be something we can do to help\nan artificial environment has been constructed on the southern continent sir\nyes captain sensors are reading human life forms\nno sir\nthe fragment has a density of one hundred billion kilograms per cubic centimetre as a result when it passes moab four it will cause tectonic shifts well beyond eight points even on the richter scale\nincreasing impulse power to tractor emitters power levels rising\naye sir\nwe have lost one of the emitter circuits\nweve lost data\nship wide life support failure in fifteen seconds sir\ntermination of all life support in five seconds\nthe fragments course has been altered by one point two one degrees sir\neight generations of us\nyou can go hannah\nif we have to evacuate any things possible\ntransferring warp power to tractor beam generator\naye sir\noh yes of course from the starship ive been looking forward to speaking with you\nive worked up a few schematics based on gravimetric potentials and deflector energy allocation\nthe biosphere s superstructure will never withstand the tectonic shocks the environment would be compromised\nyour ship what kind of energy output is it capable of generating\nwell either were going to have to move or that fragment is\na wild idea purely theoretical\nwhen we first spotted the fragment approaching i came up with the idea but we cant generate the kind of energy we would need you can\nwith my theories and their equipment we might be able to alter the fragments path its our only chance to avoid evacuation\nif we increase warp power transfer by eighty percent\nwe wont be able to reinforce the conduit to hold that power level it just doesnt work\ngeordi\nwere you always blind\nno\ndont im sorry i didnt mean to embarrass you\nmay i see it your visor\nno\nit was the wish of our founders that no one had to suffer a life with disabilities\ni dont know what to say here you go how does it work\nwhat about the data conversion rates how do you avoid a sensory overload\nwed have to avoid tractor force rebounding but that shouldnt be hard\nwhat\nand we needed a much more efficient emitter to do that\nand we couldnt get anywhere near that without overloading the emitter arrays\nthats true we wont be able to move the fragment as far as wed like to but\nwith some of the shield improvements ive discovered here it could work\ngood news aaron we should be able to change the course of the core fragment but well also need to fortify the structure and were going to need help to do it\nfifty officers are waiting for your approval to transport down we dont have much time aaron\nnone\nyou too\nemitter circuits one hundred seventy percent over standard\ngraviton generators operating normally surge pulse now synchronised emitters radiating at three hundred twenty percent over standard\nthree hundred ninety percent over standard\nno change in the fragments course\nthe emitter circuits wont hold for long\nfour hundred percent over standard\nthe fragments moved point four degrees off its previous heading point six five its working\nfragments new heading adjustment is at one point zero one degrees is it enough\nalmost there geordi course shift is at one point one six degrees\none point one eight\none point two we ve got it\nyes yes go ahead aaron\nthank you\napparently there fortification wasnt adequate theres definite structural damage it appears that the tectonic shifts created a breach\ni dont know ill have to run a diagnostic in the lab unless we seal it and fast we may have to evacuate\nbased on the level of toxicity im reading it may be only a matter of hours\nisnt it amazing after all we went through\nlooks bad its cracked well beneath the surface\nwhat do you mean\nwhat are you talking about look at it its right here i measured the toxic leak you saw me\nthe damn thing doesnt miss much does it fine ill tell them the truth will that make you happy\ni was born to be one of the best scientific minds of my generation and in the past five days i have encountered technology that i have barely imagined and ive got to ask myself if were so brilliant how come we didnt invent any of these things\nbut all my needs have been anticipated and planned for before im even born all of us in this colony have been living in the dark ages its like were victims of a two hundred year old joke until you came we could only see to the wall of our biosphere suddenly our eyes have been opened to the infinite possibilities\nthe welfare of this colony would be best served by rejoining the human race\nif wed followed that advice martin wed all be dead by now so much for the welfare of this colony\nim leaving and ill tell you something else there are at least a dozen others who are ready to go with me\ntheres nothing else for them to talk about\naaron dont you see we cant be happy here any longer we were innocent it will never be that way again\nwere not willing to stay here a few generations\nwhat will that accomplish\nin other words we are being asked to stay here for six months while they pressure us to change our minds\nwould you ever choose to liveaboard a ship in a bottle captain you are in command of a starship you live to explore the unknown we ask for that same privilege\nit wont make any difference youll only be putting the people of this colony through unnecessary pain and anguish\ndont you see aaron its over its time for you to lead our people into a new era you could come with us\nim pretty sure they know were here\nour sensors are picking up deep em readings looks like wave patterns from an obsolete subspace relay\nbeyond us\ni can see you just fine sir\nwhat function might that be\nthat show i see it\nwe have a matter antimatter warp reaction system the most powerful in the starfleet normally it kicks plasma up into the tera watt range why\nwe can move a small moon or an asteroid but a stellar core fragment thats much too massive for our tractor beam\nwhats that\na multiphase tractor beam\nwed need hannah on the ship\nit wont affect her at all theres been over a century of evidence to prove that\nenterprise three to beam up energise captains log supplemental commander laforge and hannah bates have spent three days trying to find a way to adjust the path of the core fragment if they do not succeed in the next forty eight hours we will need to begin evacuation\nits just going to blow the emitters again\nyeah i havent had any sleep in so long my eyelids feel like they have lead weights attached\nhmm\nim sorry i probably shocked the hell out of you didnt i\nill put it back on\nive never been embarrassed by this hannah never i was born blind ive always been this way\nsure so i guess if i had been conceived on your world i wouldnt even beherenow would i\nno id ve been terminated as a fertilised cell\nwho gave them the right to decide whether or not i should be here whether or not i might have something to contribute\nwell the visor scans the electromagnetic spectrum between one hertz and one hundred thousand terahertz converts it all to usable frequencies and then transmits that information directly to my brain\na bank of preprocessors compresses the data stream into pulses you see that way my visual cortex never wait a minute wait just a minute we should be able to send a high energy pulse through the tractor system if its short enough it shouldnt overload the emitters the technology is right here if we could adapt those pulse compression routines and then apply them to the warp power conduits\nsure with a few modifications oh thats perfect\nif the answer to all of this is in a visor created for a blind man who never would have existed in your society no offence intended\nin order to move the core fragment to a safe trajectory we needed our tractor beam to be able to handle high power pulses\nabout four times more efficient\nso we added a little visor technology to the process and we were able to boost the effective force and at the same time lower the power conduit stress levels\nup to almost three hundred percent\nbut if we also fortify the biosphere s structural integrity at the same time\nof course well have to lend them some of our engineering support crews\nwell need to bring down engineering crews from the enterprise to work with your people for the next forty eight hours\nthey have to install five new shield generators and power supplies\nenterprise you may begin transport when ready captains log supplemental the enterprise has moved to a parallel course with the core fragment we must adjust its trajectory by a minimum of one point two degrees to ensure the colony s safety\nyes sir good luck\nengage tractor beam okay lets give it a try shutting down non critical systems\ntransferring warp power to tractor beam generator\nbridge we need more power\ncome on come on\nwe ve got to increase the pulse frequency\nwe wont need them for long\nokay now were getting there\nacknowledged\nnot yet hold on\nhold on captain\nyes sir shutting down all tractor emissions transferring power back to life support\nmind if i give her a hand commander\nyeah amazing\nwhy are you doing this\ntheres no breach\nhannah my visors positronic scan would have detected the leak its molecular pattern enhancer would have picked up even the smallest crack\nwhy are you doing this\nwell maybe necessity really is the mother of invention you never really look for something until you need it\nshe wants to leave the colony\nwe have to do that\ni understand these are human beings counsellor with free will if she wants to leave she has every right to\nthis is a mistake aaron\nanything that would keep them out of here\nwe have a great deal to lose\nwhat is that\nit would be suicide to evacuate it would destroy everything weve worked for two centuries to accomplish\nwe have immeasurably extended the potential of humanity physically psychologically we have evolved beyond beyond\nfrankly yes no one in this society would be blind for example no offence intended\nyes well my point was just\nyour presence here has already begun to affect the entire balance of our society\nno\nthis is indirect violation of the intentions of our founders aaron\nher absence will create an additional imbalance\nwe have no idea how molecular transport will affect her dna\ncan it be repaired\nyou would ignore the welfare of the colony for your own selfish interests\nshe has been contaminated by the people on that ship\nthis is your doing we should never have answered your hails\nyou are not taking her with you\ni think it would be helpful if i\nbut\nyou are the ones who are causing pain and anguish in this colony you\nisnt that exactly what we anticipated\nhave you definitely established that theres

you shortly picard out\nyouve spent a good deal of time on the surface how do you suggest we change their minds\ntheyve managed to turn a dubious scientific endeavour into dogma\nit was a bad idea whose time is long past\ntheyve given away their humanity with this genetic manipulation many of the qualities that they breed out the uncertainty the self discovery the unknown those are many of the qualities that make life worth living well at least to me i wouldnt want to live knowing that my future was written that my boundaries had been already set would you\nthis leader of theirs conor he seems to be a reasonable man\nim sure will he leave when he sees theres no other choice\nyou admire him\nthen help him to see the reality of what may happen to his colony if he makes the right decision if he sas good a leader ashes designed to be then perhaps the others will follow\nwhats the increase in efficiency\nadvise mister conor number one and brief the appropriate officers prepare

appreciate that computer resume\ndeanna we all went into this with the best intentions\nbut you didnt and that shuman we make mistakes genetic manipulation or not nobodys perfect\nmister conor i believe that you and i should talk\nyou made decisions you felt would save your colony\nwe have both allowed this to happen\ni wish i could see away\nif you force them to stay you will be suppressing their human rights\nthat is simplistic\ni can not ignore the requests of people humans who ask for transport away from here\nyou would have me make the decision for you nut i cant do that i am willing to talk to these people with you and i will urge them not to make an impulsive choice but if finally they choose to leave the enterprise will not turn them away\nits true that our presence here has had an unintended influence on your society but its done and there is no way to undo it but feelings are running very high perhaps its not such a bad idea that you should take adequate time to weigh carefully the consequences of what your e about to do we are prepared to return in six months\nin five days you have seen only the most superficial evidence of what life is like outside this biosphere\ncome\nhow many finally\nif we ever needed reminding of the importance of the prime directive it is now\ndoesnt it our very presence may have damaged even destroyed their way of life whether or not we agree with that way of life or whether they re human or not is irrelevant number one we are responsible\nof course we did but in the end we may have proved just as dangerous to that colony

doing here\nno it doesnt\nnot much the brains can sive run are unusual but theres no damage to the hippocampus that suggests that we still have our long term memories but somehow theyre being blocked\nthats what im hoping what i need now is to see some normal brain scans for comparison is there any chance i can get the crews medical files\nthank you\ni found several cases resembling our condition in the medical index the causes are different but the cure is similar in each case\nthats my hope it involves increasing the activity of the medial temporal region of the brain using short term memory synapses to retrieve long term memory\nas soon as our medical files become available it would be dangerous to attempt treatment without them\nas selective as what was done to our own memories skills still in place but personal knowledge is unavailable\nit would be dangerous to do it without them\nthats strange the dien cephalic activity is exactly the same there should be some increase lets try broadening the bandwidth go to thirty point one raise the frequency as well increase by thirty three percent\nsome things wrong with the sequencing programme\nkieran kieran\ni dont know something went wrong with the sequence initiator were lucky we didnt lose you did any of this work do you remember anything more about yourself\nback to square one\nthe characteristic response to the kris kov gambit is to counter with the el mitra exchange particularly since i have already taken both your rooks by missing that opportunity you have left your king vulnerable\nas you wish counsellor check\nintriguing you have devised a completely unanticipated response to a classic attack you will checkmate my king in seven moves\nyou are a challenging opponent counsellor\ni will honour our agreement\nones a marian sunset made in the traditional style\ni hope you enjoy it\ni hope you enjoy it\ncan i get you something a beverage\nthe data banks that identify who i am are not functioning\nthis vessel is called the enterprise we are part of an organization called the united federation of planets the federation is currently in a state of war\nstarfleet command believes the lys ians are using a new weapon which has shifted the balance of power to their favour\nour scientists theorise the lys ians are using an energy wave either plasma based or a subspace interference pattern the weapon severely disrupts a starships computer system as well as the mental functions of its crew\nour mission is part of a highly coordinated effort to put an end to the war there are other vessels on other fronts all working according to an intricate plan\nat our current speed approximately thirty seven hours\nthe ship matches the starfleet description of alysia n destroyer a short range attack vessel with disruptor style weapons and a standard crew of fifty three\nthe destroyer has minimal shields their disruptor capacity appears to be only two point one mega joules\ncaptain the destroyer is hailing us\nit is conceivable sir\nthe lys ians have stopped transmitting captain they are powering up their disruptors they have locked on to us sir\nthere appears to be a command path discontinuity is hall attempt to rewrite the locator subroutine\nyes\ni have expended considerable thought with respect to my apparent uniqueness among the crew\nseveral possibilities suggest themselves i may represent an entire race of artificial life forms if so there may be a home planet for others of my kind a shared history and a culture of which i am not presently aware\ni have considered that possibility as well it may also be the case that every starship in the federation is equipped with an artificial life form such as myself\nthere is another possibility perhaps my origin is unique in that case i am alone we have accessed the information storage area considerable damage has been done to the files themselves\nas well as the crew records and the personal logs\nwe are entering th elysian system sir\nsensors show several objects in our path sir they are twentynine metres in length and are unmanned\nthe pods are equipped with fusion generated pulse lasers and minimal shielding\nwe are through the perimeter sir\ni am picking up no vessels no additional sentry pods\narmaments consist of four laser cannons and thirty nine cobalt fusion warheads with magnetic propulsion defensive shield output is four point three kilojoules\nfifteen thousand three hundred eleven\nim afraid so what do you think\nsomething like that\ngood\nsame thing only that time i flattened out when i should have tucked\nwell that helps a lot\nthis hurts\nthanks\nbut what about me i mean im a patient in a bathing suit that doesnt say much\ndo you have any clothes around here i could borrow at least until i figure out where the swimming pool is\nthe configuration is unfamiliar nothing in our database comes close\nwere being scanned its not like any sensor system ive ever seen shall we raise shields\nscanning intensity has increased by fifteen hundred percent\ncomputers are going down\nwhatthehell\nlooks like were all in the same boat\nbetter still who did this to us ive got some intermittent sensor readings here the scan keeps repeating itself like its stuck but it looks like theres metallic debris right in front of us distance seventeen kilometres\nthats a good possibility\nno interface period hey got something ive accessed the basic system directories\nlife support systems throughout the ship are fully operational navigation propulsion offline ro\ncompletely disrupted ro\nwe do now\nill go with you i want to get my hands on the computer core see if we can reestablish control from there\nive accessed the optical data network for the engineering core i can monitor every system thats routed through herero\neverything looks functional now if we could just access the control systems we could get them up and running\nthats where ill start\nyeah you too\nengineering to bridge\nive regained control of navigation propulsion weapons and communications\nwe should be able to tie them into the bridge in just a few minutes\ncomputer give me a biographical listing of all personnel responsible for primary operation of the ship\nis there any list of the ships senior officers\nthats better than nothing give me the crew manifest\naye sir ro\nwe have nt finished a full search of the computer records but we have found out quite a bit\nth elysian alliance theyre a genocidal race determined to destroy us the war has been going on for years\nover the last two months fourteen federation ships have been captured apparently very easily their crews held captive only sia\nyes sir were approximately here we ve been ordered to cross into lys ian territory and destroy their central command this is it the nerve centre for the entirely sian military operation\nour orders specifically require us to maintain radio silence\nwere the lynchpin to the operation if we dont destroy the central command the entire effort will fail\ndata and iran into some trouble accessing the medical file areas in the computer but with a little time im pretty sure well be able to get there three hours maximum\ni dont get it im still hitting a file wall\nyou must have been one hell of a bartender its too bad there are nt anymore of you around we could certainly use the help\ni wonder why your e the only one on board\nany conclusions\nthen again you could ve been built just for this ship\nif thats true maybe you all lookalike a standard issue android hard to construct so only one allowed per vessel\nthe mission reports are gone\nso are the medical records\nwhat bothers me captain is how specific this damage is any records of a personal nature any files that could tell us about who we are those are the ones that are gone\nbut who are we what are we doing herero\nbut how did this happen what did this to us\nif they stunned us with some type of bio electric field that could have wiped out our memories ro\nweve heard from all decks there are over a thousand people on board everyones had their memories affected in the same way we have\nwere a battleship\nbut no one theyve talked to knows any more about their identities than we do\nthe phasers are operational\nthe computer was damaged some processors might still be down\naye sir\nthats what happened to us\nhow long till we reach their central command\nactivating phaser arrays ready to fire sir\ncaptain our orders were to destroy all lys ian warships\nno their new weapon whatever it was that erased out our computers and our memories maybe this is how they do it over communication channels\nif youre wrong it could mean our destruction we cant take the risk captain\ncaptain\nwell done captain\ntheyre going to be on alert ro\nit is consistent with what we know about the newly sian weapon\nhes right captain i volunteer for the procedure\nim all right im all right what happened\nno im sorry doctor\nyou wanted to see me captain\nconcerns as to its success\nive been asking myself the same thing im sure our superiors feel their orders are justified\norders we cant ignore\nso do iid feel a lot better about this if all the questions were answered and if you want to abandon our mission until our memories return thats your choice but i must ask you is it right to risk prolonging this war to allow the needless deaths of thousands on both sides solely on the basis of our moral discomfort\ncome\nlieutenant\ni did please memory or no it seems clear that both you andi were born for battle more so than the others\nits conceivable that is the very reason that we ve been assigned to this vessel the enterprise has science officers medical specialists engineers our captain is undoubtedly an accomplished diplomat but we we are the warriors there are times for diplomacy this is not one of them\ni am concerned about completing our mission ending this war in victory we may soon face a critical moment the success of our mission may hang on a split second decision a hesitation would kill us all and those that are counting on us will surely die as well we can not let this happen that ll be all\nthe central command is directly ahead still beyond weapon range\naccording to starfleet records they res entry pods programmed to defend their central command\napproaching central command\nphaser banks ready loading torpedoes\nwere within range captain\nwaiting for your order sir\nthe rest of our forces are depending on us\ntheir battleships may be on the way right now we must attack\nbelay that order theres something wrong with the captain im taking command of this vessel fire all weapons mister worf captains log supplemental we are on a course to starbase three zero one doctor crusher has been working steadily and has restored the memories of most of the crew\non screen\nanalysis mister worf\nhail the vessel\nno lets begin this with a show of good faith\nshields up\ntake evasive action ro\nwhat happened\nnor do ii dont even remember who i am\nbut you still know how to work it ro\nclearly we still possess certain skills it would seem we know how to operate this ship but our identities have somehow been erased or suppressed\nit seems to me that determining leadership is not crucial right now we need to find out who we are and well what were doing out here\nbut if that presumption is correct then we could have sustained other damage um computer status report\ncan we get a general status report\ndo we have an onboard communications system\nlets use it this ship must have a crew they may still have their memories ro\nso far our survey team has found no deaths or injuries among the crew shuttlecraft are all operational as are the transporters\nwell i would recommend that before we prepare for combat we try to access the ships logs find out who we are what our purpose here might be\nthe question is for what\nwe should run a complete diagnostic of all command systems\nif were going to trust our lives to these systems we should be certain theyre not going to fail\nis it possible to bypass the normal pathways to get at those memories some other way\nthe medical records are our next priority\ncommander macduff have the other officers listed here report to the bridge\nyour next priority will be to retrieve any information you can about this ships mission contact the operations officer to assist you\nmister worf were all doing the best we can in a difficult situation think nothing more of it\nwhat do we know about this weapon\nmister laforge do we have any record of our current mission\nwhat are you saying\ncommander macduff set a course forth elysian central command\ntake us out of

could get our memories back is there anything you can do\nwhen can you start\nmister laforge\nproceed\ndoctor is it absolutely necessary to see the medical files to attempt treatment\ncome\nyes commander please come in sit down i find myself having grave concerns about our mission\nno no no more fundamental doubts whether or not it can be justified\norders which we cant even verify\nbut i also cant ignore that we have greatly outclassed the only enemy vessel weve encountered and that every single possible shred of information which might shed some light on this situation has been conveniently eliminated i feel as though ive been handed a weapon sent into a room and told to shoot a stranger well i need some moral context to justify that action and i dont have it im not content simply to obey orders i need to know that what i am doing is right\nslow to one quarter impulse ro\nred alert battlestations bring us to an attack posture mister worf\ntactical analysis mister

defences\nwhat are the defensive capabilities of the central command\nstandby\ni do not fire on defenceless people mister worf open a channel to the lys ians\nthe lys ians have identified commander macduff as a sat arran an alien race thats been at war with the lys ians for decades i have conveyed our deepest regrets to the lys ians over the tragedy of their lost ship and crew\nthe sat arran s weapons technology is no more advanced than the lys ians one photon torpedo would have ended their war\nnavigators on this ship have been doing flight handling assessments the same way for years ensign ro\nbridge do you mind if we discuss changes in procedure before you make them ro\ni might have said ro\nyes may be the point is i didnt get the chance ro\nthe rules on this ship do not change just because rol are n decides they do\ni dont know who any of you are\nmake that on the same starship\nthis console has tactical configuration\nwe are on the bridge theres a good chance this is our ship looks like your e the leader\nthe remains of another ship\nno voice interface\nif we even knew where to send it\nthat sounds like the next logical step start with the most crucial areas ro\nwho await a minute we ve got to coordinate our efforts here first ro\nlook i feel the same way we all do but if any things going to get done ro\nwell were going to have to depend on each other if were going to get through this okay ro\nwere going to search the ship\naccording to the schematics the engineering computer core access is down that corridor ro\nwell begin our crew survey on decks five through ten when you get those systems going try to pull up the personnel files itd be nice if we all had names right good luck\nif its any comfort were all in the same situation so stay put for now well be back in touch\ntheres a large room up ahead called ten forward ro\nid be having more fun than searching the ship id imagine ro\nwell with that holodeck we just saw i think i could conjure up an interesting programme or two ro\nwhy ro\nwho reported to the bridge from this group\nhave you found anything that might give us some insight into what happened\nno thank you ro\nyour memories are gone as well\nyou were going to mention something else\nis something wrong\nyou remember me\nsurvey team here go ahead\nthese are your quarters\nrecognise anything\ni dont imagine war ever feels right\nwhat is it\ncan you remember anything specific about us\ni hope they re good feelings\nits been a long day weve all been through a lot\nill see you tomorrow goodnight ro\ni know i didnt get the wrong room ro\nreally ro\nfor all we know you and i could hate each other ro\nwe might regret this ro\nmaybe we should switch quarters ro\nwhat if i snore in my sleep ro\nthey reno match for the enterprise\nfull shields\ncould the same treatment work for us\ncome in\nplease whats wrong\nyour e never going to feel good about this war none of us will but we ve got to complete our mission ive been doing a little research trying to find out about william trike r\nhes a musician for one thing\nno one was more surprised thani\nhes athletically inclined loves to climb mountain hes from somewhere called alaska he enjoys exotic food and takes his vacations on a planet called risa\nopen it\nthat may explain some of the familiar feelings we have\ncome in ro\nno\nof course thank you counsellor ro\noh we were just discussing the situation were all in ro\nits a little too selective to be coincidence\nits a risk i think we have to take\nim reading forty seven of them around the perimeter\nnot much power there\nthat was too easy\noptimal firing range in fifty five seconds\none photon torpedo ought to do it\nhow can our mortal enemy be over a hundred years behind us in weapons technology\nwith all the power that macduff had to alter our brain chemistry and manipulate the computers its hard to believe he needed the enterprise\nit almost did\ni hope im not interrupting ro\nwell im glad i ran into the two of you when you have no memory of who you are or who anybody else is you find yourself ro\nshe said that\nwell im a little confused\nwell see\ndata chess isnt just a game of ploys and gambits its a game of intuition\nthanks but dont think a compliments going to get you out of our bet you owe me ones a marian sunset made in the traditional style as only you can make it data\nits beautiful\ni did\nnot specifically but there are two things that seem unusual the bartender is an artificial life form\ni dont know if this means anything but i seem to have an ability that the others dont i have a very strong sense of what other people are feeling at times its almost\nno just for a moment you seemed familiar\nnot exactly i mean i dont know who you are but theres something about you\nwith whom\ncaptain theres been a great deal of damage to our computer system may be were not getting the correct information\nthat we get confirmation of this mission from our headquarters\nthere could be thousands of lives at stake\nthanks for your help come in for a minute\nits like it belongs to someone else nothing feels right this room this ship most of all this war were fighting\ni suppose that s true\nthat same feeling you seem familiar your e the only thing that does\ni dont know its more like remembering an emotion feelings that your e somehow associated with\nyes they are this entire situation is a little unnerving\nwe certainly have\nits also possible that they just want to talk to us i think we should respond\nim restless mind if i visit for awhile\neverything everytime i think about this war our mission i feel a sense of panic like a hands closing around my throat\nwhat have you discovered\nvery impressive\nso what else has your research uncovered about william riker\node to psyche john keats\nto will all my love deanna\ni dont know what to think\nensign ro\nno\ni was just visiting well talk again soon commander\ndata how many people

energy\nit might force whatever it is out of our people ro\nif this is going to work we have to have some way to contain or neutralise this anionic energy once its out of our people\ni think ive come up with an idea for a containment field\nthis anionic energy seems to be vulnerable to the same magnetic flux density we monitored in the storms if we can duplicate it we can trap it\nonce its out of our people\nexactly what i was thinking\ni can have the containment field ready by then\nthey have the same anionic signature we saw on the biofilter scans\non our way captain\nhow do you feel\nthats a good sign go home\nthe intense electromagnetic whirlwinds on the moons surface make it virtually impossible to locate the source of the signal captain\ni believe so commander at starfleet academy\ni will verify it just as i thought it is a starfleet subspace distress signal standard to daedalus class starships\none hundred seventy two years sir\nthe essex under the command of captain bryce shumard is appeared in this sector over two centuries ago\ni have accessed the subspace transponder signature of the essex it is identical to the signal coming from the moons surface\nshields are

no life sign readings other than our own\nwe might be able to employ virtual imaging to interpolate missing data\nmy apologies it seems my primary speech processors are experiencing a minor fluctuation i will have it corrected in a moment\nsir given the em field properties of this moon i recommend a search pattern beginning in the southern polar region\nthe essex signal was never clearly

immediately\nyes first officers log supplemental the enterprise has moved into asynchronous orbit near the southern polar region we await further instructions from ten forward\non the contrary weve had a difficult time with transporters since we arrived here thats why we had to send down the shuttle you should all have been aware of that fact\nmister obrien was the one who safely executed the return of the away team hes the most qualified person on board to operate the transporters under these circumstances\ni could give you safe passage to a transporter pad in one of the cargo bays\ni can give you all safe passage\nbecause i assume that if you choose go to the cargo bay then you wont to take all of the hostages their safety is my chief priority\nlet me talk to him number one i think we have an opportunity to end this siege\nit will require the cooperation of all concerned\nour guests will be moving shortly to cargo bay four where the transport will occur i want you to ensure them of safe passage between ten forward to the cargo bay\ncaptain shu mar how do you intend to achieve this rest that you so desire\nwell how do you intend to free yourselves of this existence that has so trapped your consciousness\nreally what is your scientific basis for that\ncaptain shu mar when are you going to tell me who you really are\nescape\ndid you really think using their identities would gain our sympathy\nthen this moon is a penal colony\nyour threats are meaningless now\nare you prepared to sacrifice the lives of the others theyll all die when the cargo bay hatch is blown\nif you each know the officers you inhabit then you know they re equally ready to give their lives for this ship free them now and i will return you to the moons surface\npicard to bridge\nour guests will be leaving shortly i need an emergency medical team down here\nmister worf prepare to transport these prisoners back down to the moons surface\nwhat about the entity that controlled you what were your perceptions of him\nhave you ever heard anything like this data\nthere hasnt been a daedalus class in service for what\nw arrived a little late\nwindshear is incredible data keep an eye on the stabilisers if its anything like this on the ground i dont see how anyone can survive on this moon for long\nquestion is where i still cant locate the source of the damn signal its bouncing around more than we are\nenterprise\nweve lost our thrusters attempting to compensate with secondary boosters\nhold on were going down\nmaintain the approach attitude data im taking her in brace for impact ro\nyea him pretty sure that s broken enterprise\nwell stay in the area until the enterprise finds us take an inventory of the shuttle see if there s anything left in there thats usable the ground cover is all nonporous rock which makes me believe its even less likely theres anyone living here\nthat doesnt look like any stormfront ive ever seen\nwell i hope they can find us because theres no way well find them\nmister obrien nice of you to join us\nis this stormfront going to interfere with the transport chief\nim with you\nlunchtime miles lets do it\nready for duty sir\nits not the first bone ive ever broken\nit was just one hell of a storm it moved in on our position faster than anything ive ever seen\nno but if troi was right we were very close to it\nwe need to adjust the scanners so they can penetrate those storms do you have any ideas data\nmister data deploy sensor scans when your e ready ensign take us to asynchronous orbit aligned around our crash site ro\nthe polar region that would be starting from scratch mister data our latest readings would suggest that we begin our scan around our crash site\nwell you might be right but id like to give the crash site a once over first maintain our current orbit\noverride the mro\ndo you know anything about this mister data data\nsecurity to the bridge\ncomputer transfer command to engineering full security alert\ncomputer

everybody sort it out later\nthe southern polar region thats where data tried to move the ship\nwhy wasnt i affected\nmy broken arm\nwhat about data\nwe have to find a way to penetrate the force field around ten forward\nsir putting you down there only strengthens their position\nyes sir\ngeordi how long will it take to get it all ready\nkeep me advised\nstanding by\nas you say captain riker to laforge return to the bridge\nany sign of the essex\nbridge to ten forward\nintense storm activity over the southern pole is making it virtually impossible for us to pick up any trace of the essex\ncan you tell whats there\nim sure as hell not going to beam up whatever might be down there\nbridge to ten forward\nwhatevers blocking our scanners will prevent the use of the transporters\nin order to do that riker\nunderstood captain doctor mister laforge\nalmost had the men sign nice try ten forward our mistake remaining transporter functions are being transferred to you\nsecurity teams standby ro\nmister laforge doctor theyll beat their destination in less than a minute ro\nsecurity allow them access into cargo bay four\nmister laforge\ni hope that ll give the captain enough time to play his hand ro\ntheres only one reason he chose cargo bay four if it becomes necessary ensign you will blow the cargo bay hatch on my order sro\ni think we can give the captain a new bargaining chip doctor crusher flood the cargo bay with your containment field\naye sir\naye sir\nim not sure we have someones down there alive first officers log supplemental the electromagnetic interference on the surface has been judged too dangerous for anyone to transport down so we have taken a shuttle to investigate\nmaybe they ve been living underground\nyour arm\nwhat is that\nthere is someone alive here im more certain of it now than ever\ntheyre coming theyre coming with the storm\nwhere\nmy skin its tingling\nvery glad to be here\ncaptain may i speak with you a moment in private\nive never felt anything like it it was as though they were calling to me\nperhaps for an instant it was like their voices were being carried on the wind\nim not sure but they were calling me to the southern polar region i believe that s where we should look for the essex ro\nwhat happened\nyou couldnt wait the captain would have done it for me\nwhat deck is this\ncan you move us again\ndo you know how to deactivate this\neveryone get down on the floor\nyes bridge he can hear you captains log supplemental following an aborted attempt to take control of the bridge counsellor troi mister data and chief obrien have seized ten forward\nwhat are you doing now\ngood\nthey will now attempt to negotiate for the safety and release of their people interesting under normal circumstances i would be counselling the captain at a time like this\ni would help him find a way to secure our trust\nstop it\nwe can discuss your wounded but first you will move the ship\nyou will\nchange the ships orbit to an inclination of eighty degrees south\nyou have thirty seconds to change your heading or additional members of your crew will require medical attention\nfive of your people have been injured\nyou klingon tell him\ni will release no one\nthe crew values pi cards life above all others captain picard we agree to your proposal\nacknowledged\nlower the force field\nwelcome captain allow me to introduce myself i am captain bryce shu mar of the federation starship essex\nindeed i know i was there this is my first officer commander steven mullen and my security chief lieutenant morgan kelly\nspirits ghosts but your e a man who would never believe in ghosts picard isnt that true you see troi knows you and so i do as well\nyes of course she is i have no wish to harm her or to harm anyone else\nwe have been forced to take this action captain because we need your help\nour consciousness has been trapped on this moon for two centuries we must escape this torture\ni cant explain how it happened i only know that it did the essex was caught in an electromagnetic storm just as your shuttle was moments before we crashed the bridge was struck by lightning the ship was ripped apart somehow in that instant our consciousness was absorbed in the magnetic currents on the surface\nbecause as is aid i knew you would not believe us even now i know you dont\none seven three daedalus class starship crew two hundred and twentynine\nadmiral utt anna rsu starbase twelve you will find all this in starfleet records\nthen you know i am correct\nno you dont trust us and i cant risk trusting you\ncaptain picard has every right to be curious\ni know that i also know that he will make every effort to protect the lives of his people since our demands are not excessive captain i hope you will see that it will be simpler to accede than to risk further injuries\nall you need to know for now is that we want to rest simply finally to rest\nleave her alone\nvery well were taking you to our crash site\nthat is correct\nas i told you captain the ship broke up in the atmosphere and the bridge went down here when we reach it you will be am whats left of our skeletal remains on board this ship and then take them back to earth for a proper burial you see how simple a request this is\ni will release no one\ni wish you were truly as open minded as you say picard\nare you ready to cooperate\nwe are giving you the exact coordinates of our remains onboard the wreck of the essex\ncan you do it from here\nwe must not be separated\nwhat are the risks when we leave this room\nwe will each take a hostage for protection\npicard you are mine\nlower the force field\nwhat do you mean\nit will fade as we move further from this planet\ni dont need a scientific basis just be quiet\nproceed ro\nyour e quite right picard its not rest we seek only escape\nwe were brought to this moon over five centuries ago from a star system called uxmal we were separated from our bodies and left to drift in the storms once we almost escaped onboard the essex but that ship was incapable of eluding this moons electromagnetic storms\nit was a better approach than asking you to allow hundreds of condemned prisoners on board\nthats correct but now we have your ship and your bodies to carry us homero\nno let them go or you will all die\ni advise you picard not to pass our way again\nit was as though my own consciousness were pushed to the side i was watching everything happen hearing my own voice but not being able to control any of it\nhe was intelligent actually thoughtful in a ruthless sort of way cold\ndaedalus class\nscanners read negative sir but they may be affected by the interference\nsir the shuttle crafts impulse generators have shutdown\ni am picking up the shuttles trace signature but the surface interference is distorting its position\ncaptain a major stormfront is moving in on the away teams coordinates\ntheyre in turbolift four

has suffered what looks like a level five phaser hit and four others have secondary burns they require medical attention and our captors are not affected by phaser stun settings\nspiritual possessions of this sort have been reported throughout klingon history it is called ja ty in the taking of the living by the dead\nthen you believe they may be telling the truth\nsir they know much about the essex if it is the spirit of captain shu mar\nafter living disembodied for two centuries perhaps theyve gone mad\nto die defending ones ship is the hope of every klingon\ngladly sir captains log

there is no restraining field\ni know you cant move because one of the containers shattered seven of your vertebrae and crushed your spinal cord im afraid theres no way we can repair this kind of injury captains log stardate 455873 lieutenant worf has been removed from active duty following a severe injury although an euro specialist has arrived doctor crusher believes his paralysis may be permanent\nwelcome to the enterprise doctor russell im beverly crusher\nof course send it to med lab four\nreally your e the first person to mention it\nthank you have you had a chance to review worf s case history yet\nits a cultural bias when i contacted the klingon medical division they informed me that they usually let the patient die in a case like this as a result theyve done almost no research on neurological trauma\nworf is having a hard time dealing with his injuries hes always been a difficult patient but now hes a little tough at first but im sure you ll get to like him after you get to\nyes your e probably right\nright this way\nthe cortical spinal tract has continued to deteriorate over the last seventy two hours despite enzymatic therapy\nineffective\nunnecessary the klingons refer to it as the brak lul almost every vital function in their bodies has a built in redundancy in case any primary organ or system fails\nive read of some of the preliminary work youve done\nreplace his entire spinal column\ni had no idea you were already using this on humanoids\nfirst time\neven a holographic patient would balk at those odds\nyour e talking about a spinal column even before we could replace it we have to remove the existing one and we dont know enough about klingon neurological medicine to reattach it if something goes wrong hell die i agree it has remarkable potential but your e still in the most preliminary stages of research no im afraid i cant justify the risk to worf well have to do with more conventional approaches\non my way\nhow many people were aboard\nill need to convert all three shuttle bays to emergency triage centres i also want all civilians with medical training to report for duty\nwould you like us to come back later\nthis is doctor to by russell shes from the adelman neurological institute she specialises in spinal injuries like yours weve discussed a variety of surgical procedures im afraid none of them will repair the spinal cord but we have found a way for you to regain much of your mobility we can implant a series of neural transducers in your lower torso and legs they redesigned to pick up the electrical impulses from your brain and stimulate the corresponding muscles with a little work you can eventually regain sixty to seventy percent of your motor control\nno no thats good for a first try it will take some time before you get used to manipulating the\nthese are very sophisticated devices with enough time they will give you\nperhaps this all seems a bit frightening to you know i want you to take some time before making a decision think about it\ni thought we had discussed gene tronics\ni also thought wed decided against recommending it\nhes grasping for straws and your e giving him one now instead of dealing with his paralysis hes going to be thinking about this miracle cure of yours\nyour e using the desperation of an injured man as an excuse to try a procedure that you couldnt do under normal circumstances i checked with starfleet medical they have turned down your request to test gene tronics on humanoids three times already\nlook before you do any of this\ngo ahead captain\nwere ready down here we have triage teams standing by\nabsolutely\nuse this to ca ute rise the tissue\nwhat happened here\nfrom lep or a zine thats unusual\na morath i al series\nyou used this man to test one of your theories\nmorath i al would have saved his life\nthe point is you didnt even try standard treatments\ni think you used this situation in order to test one of your theories just like your e trying to do with worf\nwhat this is about is the kind of medicine you seem to practice\ni doubt if that will be any comfort his family\ni will not be drawn into a hypothetical argument doctor your research on this ship is over your e relieved of all medical duties until further notice is that clear\nbe my guest just dont expect a lot of conversation he sinfull klingon mode honourable strong and closed

sickbay he won till put him in a restraining field and post security around his door before i let him commit suicide\nif i have to suicide is not an option putting aside for a moment the fact that a paraplegic can live a very full life there is also a conventional therapy that could restore much of his mobility\nno not all of it there are some things i cant fix klingon or no he is going to have to accept his condition\nthe first tenet of good medicine is never make the patient any worse right now worf is alive and functioning if he goes into that operation he could come out a

your e going to have to make your decision based on that friendship\nwill look im sorry i can not help you to make this decision but i can tell you this klingons choose their friends with great care

asking of him you want him to go from contemplating suicide to accepting his condition and living with the disability but its too far the road between covers a lifetime of values beliefs he cant do it beverly but perhaps he can come part of the way maybe he can be persuaded to forgo the ritual in order to take the chance at regaining the kind of life he needs a klingon may not be good at accepting defeat but he knows all about taking risks\nthis may not be good medicine but for worf it may be his only choice\ngood i understand from mister laforge theres a minor fluctuation in the starboard warp

mean his life is over\ni cant accept that\nworf isnt dying and he is not in pain he could live a long life\ni can respect his beliefs but he is asking me to take an active role in his committing suicide\nwhich leaves me back where i started\nive been studying this ritual of yours do you know what ive decided i think its despicable i hate everything about it the casual disregard for life the way it tries to cloak suicide in some glorious notion of honour i may have to respect your beliefs but i dont have to like them\nno all you really expect me to do is bring you the knife and then walk away so you can kill yourself in peace well im not going to make it that easy for you\nremember sandoval hit by a disruptor blast two years ago she lived for about a week fang lee marla aster tasha yar how many men and women how many friends have we watched die ive lost count every one of them every single one fought for life until the very end\nare you sure because i get the sense your e feeling pretty noble about the whole thing look at me arent i courageous arent ian honourable klingon let me remind you of something a klingon does not put his desires above those of his family or his friends how many people on this ship consider you a friend how many owe you their lives have you ever thought about how youve affected the people around you how we might feel about your dying\nyou are my friend and in spite of everything ive said if it were my place i would probably help you but ive been studying klingon ritual and klingon law and ive discovered that its not my place to fill that role according to tradition that honour falls to a family member preferably the oldest son\nthe son of a klingon is a man the day he can first hold a blade true\nthats an excuse what you really mean is it would be too hard for you to look at your son and tell him to bring you the knife watch you stab it into your heart then pull the knife from your chest and wipe your blood on his sleeve thats the rite of death isnt it well im sorry mister worf i cant help you theres only one person on this ship who can\nive notified starfleet that our survey of sector three seven six two eight will be delayed at least a week while we drop off survivors from the denver\nive scheduled a stress simulation routine for this afternoon to check it out has there been any word\na pleasure i have some equipment aboard the potemkin would you please have it sent to one of your medical labs\nbefore we get down to business i just wanted to say that i had the pleasure of reading your paper on cybernetic regeneration recently\ni thought it was brilliant\nyour ideas on bioactive interfaces border on revolutionary its going to be a genuine pleasure working with you\nonly briefly i must admit i was a little shocked to find the state of klingon neurological medicine to be so primitive\nwell be in uncharted waters\ndoctor i know that as a starship doctor you have to maintain close ties with patients but i think it would be best if i maintain a discreet distance that way i can give you a completely objective opinion regarding treatment\ngood well i believe you said ill be working in med lab four\nwhat about al ky sine treatment\nover designed klingon anatomy twenty three ribs two livers eight chambered heart double lined neural pia mater ive never seen so many unnecessary redundancies in one body\nits a good design in theory but in practice all the extra organs means just that much more can go wrong let me show you something ive been experimenting with based generators this is a gene tronic replicator it reads the dna coding of damaged organs translates that into a specific set of replicant instructions and then begins to grow a replacement\nthe early results have been very encouraging beverly the gene tronic replicator can create a completely new neural conduit for your lieutenant worf\nexactly instead of splicing and pasting together broken connections like a couple of glorified tailors we create a new living system\ni havent been this ll be the first time\nive done dozens of holo simulations the success rate is up to thirty seven percent\nsooner or later it has to be tried on a living patient\nyour e probably right its too radical an approach\nthe first step would be to fit your legs with motor assist units like this one theyre a training device once youve mastered using them we can move onto the implants\nnow try to move your leg\nthere is one other option id like you to consider its called gene tronic replication its still in the experimental stage but if it works it will restore virtually all of your mobility and without the need for artificial implants\nwe did\nyou heard him he d rather die than live with the implants i just gave him a better option than suicide\ntheresa real chance this could work and if it does it ll be a major breakthrough in neurogenetics that will change a lot of peoples lives\nare you really going to hide behind the rules of some bureaucracy beverly your patients life is at stake here\nbeverly could you use an extra pair of hands\nhe went into neural met aphasic shock\nhe couldnt take lep or a zine his blood pressure was too low i had to try a different treatment\nno i tried a newry bo therapy ive been working with its called borat hi um ive had some very good results\nborat hi um is decades ahead of lep or a zine and morath i al\nhis injuries were so severe i dont think any conventional treatment couldve saved him\ni made the choice i thought gave him the best chance of surviving isnt that what you would have done\nthats what this is really about isnt it lieutenant worf im offering him a chance to recover fully a chance you cant give him\ni make no excuses for my approach to medicine i dont like losing a patient any more than you do but im looking down a long road doctor this man didnt die for nothing the data that i gathered is invaluable it will eventually help save thousands of lives\nlet

hes been injured and hes embarrassed and to have anyone see him now would make him feel worse even if it were you\nalexander that klingon stuff is very important to your father\nits been a long day why dont you get ready for bed and well talk about this again in the morning\nalexander is scared confused hurt all because his father is refusing to see him\nyes i do its not the klingon way right\nall i care about at this moment is a little boy who s terrified hes going to lose his father\nmaybe its time you stopped lying here worrying about your honour and started thinking about someone

true\noh no men want to be attractive too believe me they just go about it differently\nno colour they like to pretend theyre not doing anything to attract a woman even when its the most important thing on their minds\nneither in the past women were often considered weak and inferior but that hasnt been true for a long time\nwill your copilot is going to be fine the injury was minor\ni dont see any problem but if you feel any symptoms headache dizziness come back\nlet me get this straight are you saying its a womans game because women are weak and need more help\nand just this afternoon i was insisting to one of the jna ii that those attitudes were but a distant memory\nwell one of them seems to be overcoming the differences at least in regards to one of us\ni could be wrong but i get

readme\nwell try to get a tractor beamon you\nright away commander\nthats it commander everything checks out the energy buffer is installed and functioning i estimate it should reduce the power drain to your systems by about forty percent\nlets just say you dont want to waste any time once you get in there youll have to give him continuous readouts on energy consumption i cant even predict if the drain will beat a constant rate\nthen thats it commander ill monitor you as far as i can but once you get inside that pocket your e on your own\nill notify doctor crusher to be standing by\nlaforge to bridge\nwere ready to initiate shuttle prelaunch sequence\nyes doctor\nis the shuttle still there\nthen perhaps our crew has survived\ncommander were grateful for your help whatever resources we can provide are yours\nyou are aware of the charges against you\ndo you intend to dispute them well what is your response\ncommander riker these proceedings are closed to everyone\nsir this is a private matter we are grateful for your recent help but that gives you no right to interfere with our personal concerns\nis this true\ni congratulate you soren your decision to admit your perversion makes it much more likely that we can help you\ncommander\ncommander after soren s diatribe you must think that we are a cruel repressive people nothing could be further from the truth\nwe are concerned about our citizens we take our obligations to them seriously soren is sick and sick people want to get well\nyou dont understand we have a very high success rate in treating deviants like this and without

system contains one of these null pockets if were right the pocket would absorb electromagnetic energy from anything that entered it\nor a probe making them powerless\nwe think so the shuttle probably wasnt able to sustain its energy but other than that it wouldnt be damaged\nwe can send one of our own shuttles but its energy would also be absorbed our chief engineer is working on a way to maintain the power reserves long enough to rescue your crew\nits a starfleet craft\nyou cant pilot a shuttle your e not familiar with\ni happen to be a good pilot too and i know my way around the starfleet shuttle so what if we team up\nright now\nthis is it short range craft two twelve hundred fifty milli cochrane warp engines\nright\nnone usually this ones been fitted with two type four phaser emitters well use those to chart the nullspace\nmister laforge wants to get an idea of the size of the pocket he thinks the rate of energy absorption is linked to its size\nwell thats where the emitters come in we shootout a series of photon pulses into the pocket and chart where each one disappears from that we should get a fairly complete outline\nlater well try a flight simulation right now lets do a systems review ill talk you through it\nyou handle these controls like you grew up in a shuttle\nhe had a good student\nokay for two days ive been trying to construct sentences without

i had it programmed into the replicators well\nits very healthy helps to keep you warm on cold alaskan nights\ni see\nstill sounds better than pea soup\na little its hard to grasp the idea of no gender\nsnips and snails and puppy dog tails\nits an old nursery rhyme girls are made from sugar and spice and boys are made from snips and snails\nits an old fashioned way of looking at the sexes not to say that theres no real difference between them physically men are bigger stronger in the upper body we have different sexual organs men cant bear young\nmost people think so but thats the kind of question that would take a lifetime to answer let me ask you whats it like on a planet where the people have no gender\nwell who leads when you dance if you dance\nwithout the battle of the sexes you probably dont have as many arguments\nfrom the sound of it theres not that much difference between our species\ni like one who s intelligent and sure of herself who i can talk with and get something back but the most important thing of all she has to laugh at my jokes\nnot at all some like quiet demure women others prefer a lot of energy some only respond to physical attractiveness others couldnt

feel better\nthe port nacelle must have nipped one of the protrusions from the null pocket and shut it down\nthat depends on how you redoing\nwhoa maybe we should get the doctors opinion first\nthe portable transporter array is in when we get into nullspace well need to initialise it before we can transport the jna ii crew to this shuttle but there should still be enough power left to beam all of us back to the enterprise\nnot yet geordi thinks that ll be ready by oh eight hundred hours tomorrow but before that we should see if we can balance this engine can you access the starboard manifold thrust\nset the arc at six point three ill optimise the plasma flow\nwhats that\ni have to admit i had a feeling you were different\nwhy\nhow long have you known that you were like this\nand when you realised what then\ndo you have relationships with others\nany guess how long well have\nwe dont have any idea what condition the shuttle crew is in sowell all beam directly to

give us one last shot\nwill explode but if we stay here were dead anyway maximum energy levels five seconds see you in a minute\nyour colleagues oren was very helpful\ni just needed some air i can only take so much of these social functions and then i need to breathe a little\ni was raised outdoors im never been very comfortable in crowded rooms\nyes it is its beautiful\nyes i would ive always been interested in exo botany\nthank you its kind of you\nwhats all this\ndo you know who any of these people are\nthis one looks like you deanna i have something on my mind i had to see you\nive met someone someone who s becoming important to me\nyes your e my friend i thought i dont know i thought i should tell you\nnothing will change between us will it\nhello im here to see soren\nwe had an appointment we were going to discuss\nexcuse me\nwhere is soren\nanswer me where is soren\nthe hell there is nt\ni think i just opened them\ni want you to know what really happened its all my fault i was attracted to soren i pursued i insisted i didnt understand your ways until she explained them to me and rejected me nothing happened between us i ask your forgiveness i behaved inappropriately\nsoren\nwait wait wait you dont have to do this\nlet me take her with me she can go back to the enterprise we would give her asylum you would never have to see her again that would solve the problem wouldnt it youd be rid of her she would never be able to influence anyone again\nim just trying to find a solution that would satisfy everyone\ndid it occur to you that she might like to stay the way she is\nshe is\ndont do this soren\nriker to enterprise one to transport\ni cant just leave her there theyll give her these psycho tec tic treatments i dont know what to do\nsir their minds are set they dont want to hear another alternative\nthere has to be my relationship with soren is not trivial shes very important to me its my fault that this happened i have to help her\ni know that but i have to do something\nim aware of that\nyouve made yourself very clear sir\nthank you may i be excused now\nwho is it\ncome in\nfine leave it ill take a look at it later\nthank you youre dismissed\nlieutenant\nsome things happening theyre leaving\nokay excuse me i need to speak to her alone for a moment\ndont worry well be out of herein a minute\nall right 1ere almost there\ni wont let them hurt you youll be safe on the enterprise\nevery things going to be all right every things going to be fine\nwhat are you talking about\nwhat\nmay be doctor crusher can treat you and bring you back to the way you were\nsoren i love you\ncaptain\nyes sir\nfinished sir\nit couldnt have travelled outside the system\nthere has to be an explanation\nwhat happened where did it go captains log supplemental the sudden disappearance of our probe suggests that we may have found the first instance of what is called nullspace an anomaly which until now had been only theoretical commander riker has been working around the clock with a team of jna ii specialists to formalise this hypothesis\nduring the creation of a star system when clouds of interstellar dust and gas coalesce turbulent regions of magnetic and gravitational field s may develop if certain conditions occur these fields can condense into abnormal pockets of space\nlike a shuttlecraft\nbut outside the pocket all the energy is bent around it making it naturally cloaked thats why we can not see it and our sensors can not read it\nsince our shuttles carry ple store ne based backup systems we think life support would sustain for as long as ten days\nive been thinking when the time comes i would like to pilot the shuttle\ni can not ask you to put yourself in danger to rescue our crew\ni happen to be a good pilot\nwhen can we go over the shuttle flight operations\nis this the one\nlooks like micro fusion thrusters\narmament\nchart it\nim not sure how we go about mapping something we cant see\nlets take a look at the controls\nlet me try it propulsion system transfer conduits wheres the schematic reactor assembly oh there it is engine nacelles theres nothing here thats unfamiliar navigational deflector redundant graviton polarity source generators\ni did my parents were pilots i was flying with them before i could walk and as soon as i was old enough i entered flight school k rite was my instructor\nhe commander there are no hes or shes in a species without gender\nwe use a pronoun which is neutral i do not think there is really a translation\nwell if thats the systems review i dont see any problem whats next\nwhat is it\nunusual but i think i like it\nwe prefer to stay warm by sleeping with a friend\nnot to mate just to sleep together for warmth\nwe are puzzling to you are nt we\nits just as hard for us to understand the strange division in your species males and females you are male tell me about males what is it that makes you different from females\nyou have a dogs tail\nthat makes it sound better to be female\nand what about feelings or emotional attitudes are they different\nim afraid i dont understand\nwe do and whoever staller leads\njust because we dont have gender doesnt mean we dont have conflicts were very strong minded we love a good fight\nmaybe not what kind of woman do you find attractive\ntell me is that the kind of woman that all human males prefer\nyou make it sound very complex\nwell perhaps it is that complexity which makes differences in the sexes so interesting\nplease take my place k rite i have to be going thankyou for going over the flight protocols commander it was very helpful captains log supplemental commander riker and the jna ii pilot have set out to chart the nullspace pocket if they are successful we can then proceed with a rescue attempt\nive illuminated the delta four grid map well start there and expand\npulse vanished at delta four point two by point three\ndelta four point four by point five\ncommander tell me about your sexual organs\nis that an uncomfortable subject for humans\nim interested in your mating practices what is involved with two sexes\nmating\nour foetuses are incubated in fibrous husks which the parents inseminate from what we know of other species our method is less risky and less painful\nless enjoyable\nthats just the last step mating is a long ritual for us full of variety and invention i assure you it is extremely pleasurable\nthat may be coming from our shuttle ill note these coordinates\ni wonder\nif a human and ajna ii would be sexually compatible\nof course it would never be permitted\nthe idea of gender it is offensive to my people you see long ago we had two sexes as you do but we evolved into a higher form i dont mean to sound insulting but on my planet we have been taught that gender is primitive\nless evolved\ndelta five grid map is fully plotted\nreducing power in the starboard nacelle\nthrusters arent responding ill try to reroute the firing sequence\ndoctor you are female\nforgive me i do not mean to be rude but im curious what is it like\nive noticed you tend to have longer hair and you arrange it more elaborately and you apply colour to your bodies\nyou put colour on your mouths and your eyes your cheeks your fingernails the men dont\nthen it is up to women to attract the men\nno colour\nthis is very confusing then are women considered more superior or are men\nim afraid your e not rid of me yet commander i will be able to complete the mission\nwhat happened what made the shuttle go into a spin\nare we still on schedule then\nim fine we should go check the port engine\ndoctor\nyou have my word\nis the buffer field generator installed\nthere\ncommander id like to tell you something something thats not easy to say\ni find you attractive im taking a terrible risk telling you that it means revealing something to you something that if it were known on my planet would be very dangerous for me occasionally among my people there are a few who are born different who are throwbacks from the era when we all had gender some have strong inclinations to maleness and some have urges to be female i am one of the latter\ni was hoping you would but in front of k rite and the others i must be careful not to reveal myself\non our world these feelings are forbidden those who are discovered are shamed and ridiculed and only by undergoing psycho tec tic therapy and having all elements of gender eliminated can they become accepted into society again those of us who have these urges live secret and guarded lives we seek each other out always hiding always terrified of being discovered\nive known i was different all my life but i didnt understand how or why until i was older\ni remember when i was very young before i knew what i was there was a rumour in my school that one of the students preferred a gender in that case male the children started making fun of him and every day they were more cruel they could tell he was afraid and somehow that seemed to encourage them one morning in class he appeared bleeding and in ripped clothes he said he had fallen down and of course the school authorities found out and took him away and gave him psycho tec tic treatments when he came back he stood in front of the whole school and told us how happy he was now that he had been cured after that i realised how dangerous it was to be different and once i got older and knew what i was i was terrified i have had to live with that fear ever since\nyes with those who have discovered they are male i have had to live a life of pretence and lies but with you i can be honest please dont say anything just think about it\ni understand\nheading confirmed energy readings are normal with power reserves stabilised at one hundred percent\nits dead ahead approximately fifty kilometres\npower reserves are down to eighty four percent\ncalling the tar is m urn do you readme\npower reserves at sixty eight percent and dropping\nwe used ten mega joules with that attempt were down to thirty four percent of reserves\nthey need medical attention quickly\nwere down to nine percent we dont have enough to get back\nbut if we use an energy shift of that size itll overload the phase compensators the shuttle\ni will see you later tonight commander\nthere you are commander i wondered what had happened to our guest of honour\ni would think you had attended so many affairs like this that it would become second nature to you\nwhat do you think of our planet isnt it beautiful\nwe have many varieties of plant life perhaps you would like to inspect some of them\nplease let me take you on a tour\none of my favourites is this men ellen tree the leaves first turn pure white and then blue when the weather gets cold

remain in orbit of jna ii charting the anomaly\nyes\nno\ni am tired of lies i am female i was born that way i have had those feelings those longings all of my life it is not unnatural i am not sick because i feel this way i do not need to be helped i do not need to be cured what i need and what all of those who are like me need is your understanding and your compassion we have not injured you in anyway and yet we are scorned and attacked and all because we are different what we do is no different from what you do we talk and laugh we complain about work and we wonder about growing old we talk about our families and we worry about the future and we cry with each other when things seem hopeless all of the loving things that you do with each other that is what we do and for that we are called misfits and deviants and criminals what right do you have to punish us what right do you have to change us what makes you think you can dictate how people love each other\nwait\nplease dont\nyou can not do this\ni am so sorry it was my fault that you got involved in all this\nno it is not\nit was all a mistake and i should have realised it from the beginning\nthat i was sick i had these terrible

going to sound pretty wild somehow weve entered what seems to be a temporal causality loop we think were stuck in a particular fragment in time and we ve been repeating that same fragment over and

weakness it was mathematics\nhis mother and i thought he d never get out of calculus then he found out what the academy entrance requirements were like that turned him around he stayed after class got a tutor he really worked hard never gave up on anything and he had a lot of respect for you and everybody on the team i realise it was his fault that everybody could have been killed and i want to say that i want to say im sorry im sorry that he let you down\nhey cant you see that sa flowerbed\ni know that what happened to your hair\nim pretty damned cranky thank you ive already replanted this bed four times this week\nyou\nwell dont plant em too deep the stems\ncaptain picard of the enterprise no less and giving the commencement address\nsurprised uhuh nothing you ever did surprised me son except that time you caught that ligon ian with a reverse body lift and pinned him in the first fourteen seconds of the match didnt think you had it in you\nhmmm\ntheres nothing to tell\nyou made a mistake there isnt a man among us who has nt been young enough to make one\nyou did what you had to do you did what you thought was best i just made sure that you listened to yourself\ni was and by the way i was about the same age you are now\nyou needed to get your bearings i knew that the important thing is what you did with your life afterwards seems you did okay thats thanks enough for me\njosh albert yeah crusher hajar sito locarno i know them all\nthese weeds keep popping up in the pittosporum poor plants dont have a chance to grow\nand you could explore space on a holodeck instead of a starship\nnot going well is it\ndo you remember the par rises squares tournament of twenty four\nit took me three weeks to repair the grounds after the celebration\nwell the cadets today are just as proud of the nova squadron the celebration they held after nova won the rigel cup made twenty four look like a dinner party to the other cadets the members of that team are gods and thats a hard image to live up to but nick locarno he watches out for them he keeps them together nick is what makes that team special hes their coach surrogate father and best friend allinone a natural leader the members of that team love him if he asks them to do something they do it even if it means going right over a cliff\nhello captain i know your e a close friend of the crusher family\ni wanted to inform you personally theres been an accident\nthere was very little left to salvage from the wreckage we did recover one of the ships data recorders but it was badly damaged were attempting to restore the information but that will take some time standard procedure calls for an immediate investigation by two command level officers captain satel kandi will be taking depositions from nova squadron at fifteen hundred hours today commander albert im sure that everyone in this room joins me in expressing my deepest sympathies to you on the tragic loss of your son there will be a memorial service for cadet albert this evening in the west garden it has been suggested that we should cancel the graduation ceremonies in the light of whats happened commander albert and i have discussed this and weve agreed that commencement should go forward as planned the cadets should know that even after a tragedy like this there are still duties to perform and life continues thank you all for coming\nits good to see you again captain i wish it were under better circumstances\nim sure well be able to conduct the investigation but thankyou for your offer\nand you were still in the lead position\ncontinue\nthank you mister locarno cadet hajar\na steam navigator you filed a flight plan with the academy range officer before the exercise correct\ndid nova squadron deviate from that flightplan after you entered the saturn range\nthen how do you explain the fact that the low apogee turnaround titan was at least two thousand kilometres closer to the moon than indicated in your plan\nthat was not my question cadet\nif you were flying on sensors alone perhaps you could tell us the orientation of his ship before the collision\nyou were flying a ship travelling eighty thousand kph with cadet alberts ship less than ten metres away and you dont know what his orientation was\ngo ahead\nand you didnt report this to anyone\nthen you are saying that the accident was cadet alberts fault\nplease be seated im very disturbed by what ive heard here today by your own admission you allowed your teammate to fly when you knew he was having difficulties maintaining formation that demonstrates a serious lack of judgment i am also disturbed by the fact that you did not come forward with this information immediately we should have the first data from mister crushers flight recorder tonight we will reconvene at thirteen hundred hours tomorrow\nare you ready mister crusher\nwhere is mister albert at this point\nthat is the extent of the data we were able to recover from the flight recorder mister crusher would you describe what happened after you left orbit of titan\ndo you have anything to add to your testimony\ni want you to be absolutely clear on this point mister crusher before the collision was nova squadron in a diamond slot formation\nmister crusher are these ships in a diamond slot formation\nwhat is your explanation mister crusher\ncaptain satel kandi have gone over your testimony and the physical evidence from the crash your statements can not be reconciled with the data collected from the nav con satellite your unwillingness to offer any explanation for this contradiction is disappointing and raises suspicion we can not escape the conclusion that either the data is faulty in some way or you have lied to us however suspicion is not proof and i have no proof that you have lied to this inquiry therefore if no further evidence is presented i have no choice but to close this investigation for filing an inaccurate flightplan and for allowing cadet albert to fly when you knew he was having difficulties i am ordering a formal reprimand placed on each of your permanent record siam also revoking your flight privileges this inquiry is closed\nproceed mister crusher\nmister locarno you are the leader of nova squadron do you have anything to say mister locarno\nsorry im really sorry\nhave they completed the regeneration series\nwesleys allergic to me to rap an treatments i think they ll have to use abi car i dine substitute i should send his complete records to the academy infirmary of course they probably have them already but you cant be too sure\ni know he s fine i know he s fine how did it happen\ndo you know who it was\nwesley spoke of him they were friends wesley was so excited to make the flight team of course i was a little nervous but i was proud of him i always knew there was a chance that something like this might\nwe si was so worried about you\nwe were very sorry to hear about joshua\nhello\nand how are you feeling nicholas\nof course let me know if you need anything\nwhats wrong\nevery things going to be okay wesley there must be an explanation for all this data and geordi are already analysing the flight recorder and the satellite transmission\nthere must be something wrong with the satellite data it might have been tampered with\nwell there must be some explanation for this i know you retelling the truth but the satellite data made it look as if you were lying ive spoken with the other parents i am going to talk to admiral brand and ask her to delay the inquiry\nim not going to let them ruin your career wesley you havent done anything wrong\nwe should be arriving at earth in ten hours sixteen minutes sir\nwe unsuccessfully tried fifty three different computational models in an effort to simulate the movements of the nova squadron just prior to the crash\nhowever it was well within operational limits\nwe did find that wesley opened his coolant interlock just before beginning the manoeuvre around titan\nthat procedure would be extremely hazardous while the ship was in flight\nyes sir\nno sir\nwe were still within flightsafety parameters sir\nwe had discussed changing our approach after i filed the flightplan the final decision was made en route to saturn i didnt consider it significant enough to mention here i apologise for the confusion siri should have been more precise\nno sir my first indications of trouble was when my proximity alarm went off\nhe must have pulled away too soon i think he got scared\ni dont know captain the academy has one of the best reconstructive analysis labs in starfleet im not sure there s much we could contribute to the investigation\nunderstood sir well get right on it\nnothing conclusive we do know that the collision occurred about four seconds after the satellite images were recorded but we still dont know how the ships got into the new formation or why the crash occurred\nthere re just too many variables to take into consideration speed attitude course\nthe starboard power flow was fluctuating\nfluidic pressure in the landing struts was low but i dont know what difference that would make\nthat is a bit unusual normally the interlock is closed unless your e performing a check on the engine coolant levels but theres no evidence wesley was performing that sort of check\nits the first step in purging the plasma exhaust\nyeah the engine would probably ignite the plasma\nhi\ncaptain sir\nhello doctor\ncaptain picard\ni came by to see if we shad healed up all right\nim okay i just never lost anyone under my command before\nyou too sir\nthe inquiry is scheduled for fifteen hundred hours are you ready\ndont worry about it wes every things going to be all right so long as we stick together\nyou nervous\nthats okay so ami but were going to be all right we ve got some tough times ahead but weve always come through for each other whatever happens i want you all to know that leading this team has been the high point of my years at the academy no one could have asked for a better team or better friends lets go\nat this point we accelerated and executed a starboard turn of twenty seven degrees we came out of the turn on course for titan\nyes sir\nas we entered titans gravitational sphere i gave the signal to tighten up and move into a diamond slot formation remaining in the diamond formation we executed a low apogee turnaround titan then began az plus twenty five degree climb in preparation for a yeager loop\napproximately nine seconds later cadet alberts ship collided with cadet ha jars we had less than two seconds to activate our emergency transporters and beam to the evac stations at mimas everyone made it except josh\nno sir\nsir may i\nadmiral josh was a good pilot but lately hed been having difficulties hedge t nervous during close flybys and pull away in the final seconds his formation flying was a little erratic\nno sir i didnt wed flown together a long time i thought he could handle it if i gave him a chance i was wrong\ni think josh got frightened and tried to pull out of the turn prematurely and then crashed into cadet hajar josh was our friend we didnt want him to be remembered as someone who panicked\neverythings fine trust me\ni had to do something\ni didnt lie everything i said was the truth\nlook he was my friend to owes i worked to get him on this team but the truth is he panicked\nof course we do none of us has wanted to say it out loud but weve all had the same thought havent we\nsito\nwes i know you want to protect his memory we all do but we have to lookout for ourselves now what do you want us to do walkin and tell them everything that happened\nare we ready for that well take this one step at a time this is the preliminary report from your flight recorder it was so badly damaged in the crash that the lab could only retrieve a third of the total telemetry on the recorder and all of it is before the collision theres no problem here\nthe first night i met you wes i knew i wanted you on this squad you more than any of the rest would understand what it means to be able to count on someone because you ve been out there putting yourself on the line you know you ve got to be able to count on the people on your team because your life is in their hands and their lives are in yours we made a promise to each other right in the beginning that wed stick together we were nova squadron nobody else could say that and even after we graduated wed try to get posted to the same duty we were going to be a team for a long time josh cant be a part of those plans anymore but i think he would still want us to be a team what do you think\nyour message said it was urgent\ncalm down calm down now tell me exactly what happened\nyou said he d figured it out does he have any evidence\ncaptain picard doesnt know anything he has a theory so let him tell the inquiry what he thinks happened theyll ask us is it true well say no sir theres no evidence so theres no case well get off with a reprimand\nwesley we have to hang on just a little longer then this will all be over\nwesley\nyour e going to tell them what happened you alone are going to decide what happens to me to sito to jean your e going to decide that\nyou cantlie to them you cant live with this you have to tell them what happened who the hell are you\nyour e going to turn us in\nno you wait a minute he got to you didnt he picard told you some big story about duty and honour it must ve been a pretty good speech to make you turn your back on your friends\nwhat about your duty to your friends i got you on this team i gave you a chance when there were upperclassmen waiting in line i said he wont let us down he was on the enterprise he knows what its like to trust somebody with his life i guess i was wrong\nwe dont want to come forward sito jean and me we dont have a problem with this but if you do then resign your appointment to the academy and walk away dont make us pay for your guilty conscience\nto save the team thats more important than you and its more important than me and if i was in your place id do it without hesitation but thats me\nno sir\nmister data\nplease inform the academy mister worf and send my regards to superintendant brand\nweve met a few times shes a formidable woman\nmy superintendent was a beta zoid a full telepath when he sent for you to his office he didnt have to ask what you d done\non screen\nin my ready room\nadmiral brand what can i do for you\nyes\nhe had second degree burns on his chest and multiple fractures of his right arm but he s going to be fine\nim not certain\nbeverly hes fine\napparently his squadron was practicing on the academy flight range near saturn they were flying a close formation there was a collision all five ships were destroyed four of the cadets managed to transport out one didnt make it\nyes his name was joshua albert\nbeverly wesleys alive and he swell\nthis is an unhappy way to begin commencement if you require any assistance then the enterprise is at your disposal\nhow are you feeling wesley\nwould you like to talk about it\ni understand but i just want you to know im available if you should change your mind\nat ease cadet\nmister locarno\nim afraid that never gets easier\nill see you at the inquiry good to meet you mister locarno\nboothby jean luc picard class of twenty seven\nhow are you\nlet me give you a hand\nive acquired an interest over the years\nwill rot\nyou sound surprised\nwell it was all in the legs all that running i did boothby\ni dont think i ever i dont think i ever told you how much i appreciate\nyes there is i just wanted to while i was here look you know as well as i do i would never have graduated if you\nnevertheless\nat the time i thought you were a mean spirited vicious old man\ni didnt speak to you for months\ndid you know the boy from nova squadron who was killed\nwell its unusual to fly on sensors alone in this type of manoeuvre the pilot relies on visual clues from the other ships to maintain formation\nyes that may well be but wesleys one of our own\ngood ive spoken with admiral brand and shes agreed to allow us access to all of the physical evidence and testimony thank you gentlemen\nyou could use a good herbicide instead of pulling the weeds with your bare hands\nboothby tell me some more about nova squadron\nno it isnt\nthe final game against minsk\nwe had a lot to celebrate our team wasnt supposed to win we were very proud of them\nreport\ndid wesleys flight recorder indicate that there was anything unusual about the ship or the way it was operating\nfilling the primary coolant tanks requires an open interlock but that can only be performed in a maintenance bay is there any other reason for opening the valve\nignite the plasma thats exactly what they were trying to do\ncome\ncan you tell me what manoeuvre this is\nfive ships crossing within ten metres of each other and igniting their plasma trails one of the most spectacular and difficult demonstrations of precision flying it has nt been performed at the academy team in over a hundred years do you know why\nan accident in which all five cadets lost their lives i think that nicholas locarno wanted to end his academy career in a blaze of glory that he convinced the four of you to learn the kol voor d starburst for the commencement demonstration if it worked you would thrill the assembled guests and locarno would graduate as a living legend only it didnt work and joshua albert paid the price ami correct cadet i asked you a question ami correct\nyou choose not to answer but youve already given an answer to the inquiry and that answer was a lie\nwhat you neglected to mention was that following the loop your team attempted a manoeuvre that was the direct cause of the crash you told the truth up to a point but a lie of omission is still a lie do you remember the day you first came aboard this ship your mother brought you on the bridge\nyou even satin my chair i was annoyed presumptuous child playing on my ship but i never forgot how you already knew every control every display you behaved as though you belonged on the bridge and then later when i decided to make you an acting ensign i was convinced you could be an outstanding officer ive never questioned that conviction until now the first duty of every starfleet officer is to the truth whether its scientific truth or historical truth or personal truth it is the guiding principle upon which starfleet is based if you cant find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened you dont deserve to wear that uniform im going to make this simple for you mister crusher either you come forward and tell admiral brand what really took place ori will\ndismissed\nmister locarno has been expelled\nthey very nearly did mister locarno made an impassioned plea for the rest of you he said that he d used his influence as squadron leader to convince you to attempt the kol voor d manoeuvre and then to cover up the truth he asked to take full responsibility\nyou should feel bad and you will pay for what youve done admiral brand has decided that in addition to a formal reprimand your academic credits for the past year will be cancelled and you will not advance with your class\nits not going to be easy staying here on campus everyone knowing what you did you have difficult times ahead\nyou knew what you had to do i just made sure you listened to yourself goodbye cadet\nsounds like my superintendent when i was at the academy we had a vulcan superintendent who had memorised the personnel files of every single cadet he knew everything about them it was like having your parents around all the time\nyou got called into the superintendents office thats a story id like to hear\ndid you see mister alberts ship break formation before it collided with your ship\nyou may be seated did any of you see the collision take place\ncadet sito you were in the tail position therefore you should have seen any sign of trouble from cadet albert yet you saw nothing\ndid your attention falter\nsensor readings\nmister crusher will you describe a yeager loop\nmister crusher did your team remain information throughout the loop\ncomputer display saturn nav con file six dash three seven nine these images were obtained by a navigational control satellite in orbit around saturn during a standard sensor sweep computer freeze image magnify sector gamma three and enhance\nthis image was recorded when your ships moved briefly into the satellites sensor range according to the time index what you see on the monitor took place seven seconds after nova squadron completed the yeager loop\nnoyes\nthat is correct sir\nno siri was flying solely on sensor readings at the time i did not have any visual contact with cadet alberts ship when he broke formation\ni dont know sir\ni dont remember sir\nyou shouldnt have said it nick josh wasnt responsible for what happened\nwe might as well turn in our uniforms and start packing our bags\nyou dont have to lie just dont volunteer any new information\ndo you know admiral brand\nnot bad the arms a little sore\nno i dont think so no thankyou i know your e trying to be helpful sir but it seems like that sal live talked about for the last two days i dont want to go through it again\nthank you sir\nhi\nthis is my squadron leader nicholas locarno this is captain jean luc picard of the enterprise my mother doctor beverly crusher\ncaptain mom will you excuse us please nick and i have some things we need to talk about\ni will\ni think so\nyou said we wouldnt have to lie to them we all agreed not to lie to them\nthe accident was not josh s fault\nwe dont know that\ni dont know if i can do this nick\nsir\nnoi was just going over my deposition for tomorrow\nour ski trip josh and i went to calgary last month he forgot his sweater so he borrowed one of mine\na little he only needed help in statistical mechanics\nno he could do it he just didnt like to\nyes sir this is the beginning of our run toward titan im on the right wing\nhe was on my port quarter approximately fifty metres away weve just received the signal to begin the diamonds lot formation thats cadet locarno coming into view were in a twenty degree turnaround titan we should be coming out of titans gravity well about now\nonce we cleared the moon mister locarno led us into a yeager loop approximately nine seconds later my proximity alarm went off i tried to veer away but it was too late and i was hit i lost control of my ship a power coupling exploded in my cockpit i dont know how but i managed to activate my escape transporter and the next thing i remember is finding myself on the emergency evac station on mimas with the rest of the squadron except josh\nno sir\nthe ships begin in a diamond slot formation and climb and loop backwards at a steep angle and at the peak of the loop turnover and accelerate in a new direction\nyes sir\nyes sir\nno sir\ni have none sir\nwhy\nmom\nmom dont you cant do that\nmom dont try to protect me please stay out of this\ncaptain\nits a kol voor d starburst sir\nit was banned by the academy following a training accident sir\ni choose not to answer sir\ni said the accident occurred after the loop it did\nyes\ncaptain\nthey know nick they know what we did\ncaptain picard called me to the enterprise when i got there he told me that he knows the kol voor d manoeuvre the cover up everything he said that if i didnt come forward and tell the truth now he would\nno but he knew exactly how it happened\ni cant call captain picard a liar\nits wrong nick\nno im going to tell them what happened\nim not going to lie to them again nick i cant live with it\nnick\nnow wait a minute\nwere starfleet cadets we have a duty to the truth\nif we all come forward together and tell admiral brand\nyou d let me do that you d let me throw my career away just to save your neck\nsiri would like to add something to my testimony\nyesterday i testified that the crash occurred following a yeager loop that is not entirely true we performed a loop and afterwards broke formation and attempted a kol voor d starburst we knew it was prohibited we knew it was dangerous but we wanted to do something spectacular for the commencement demonstration we pushed josh into it and he was nt ready we thought we could do it we thought we could do anything we were wrong and josh died josh didnt let us down sir it wasnt his fault\nthey should ve expelled all of us\nhe did exactly what he said he would he protected the team i feel awful ive let down everyone my mother my friends you\ni understand\nyes sir

the profile you are the ships counsellor\nand my escort who need not be addressed in this company\ni would not do you nor our benevolent hosts the disservice of failing to ensure that priorities are observed\nafter all it would be unpardonable to simply abandon ourselves to the moment would it not\ni dont wish to be authoritative my dear but master er ko says that now is our proper time for discussion of certain details\nsurely there ll be other occasions for you to spend time with the boy\nwe have business to deal with here leaving is simply not acceptable\nyou are missing the point\nl

chron dite it is unlikely another photon torpedo will be of any effect\nthirty seconds to impact\nimpact in seventeen seconds\nthe remaining debris is of no threat to the planet sir\na level four diagnostic of the food replication systems has failed to detect any faults in the orientation terminals\nthere is an energy fluctuation in one of the utility access corridors\nwe have traced the failure to a datanet interface which routes replicator selections to the correct sub processors\nwe have lost helm control sir\naye sir\nwe have not yet identified the substance commander\nthere is none present in the residue either\nthat would suggest then i trium has been organically metabolised\nthis residue would be the waste left behind\nthe dilithium chamber shows no anomalous readings\nwe believe the parasites came through the ships hull after we destroyed the asteroid near t essen three\naye sir\nat warp nine five hours twenty minutes sir\ncaptain with our sensors unable to detect the parasites and given the speed with which they appear to be moving through the ship\nin several cases an ex an ogen gas barrier has been known to slow the progress of metal parasites\nif were configure

sir\naye sir\nminister the woman should not be addressing you in the familiar\npreferably he should be called by his ministerial title\nit is essential that we begin a discussion of the wedding procedures now\ndefinitely not\nnor may a servant be present during a prenuptial consultation\nthis is intolerable\nminister minister this is infamous infamous we leave immediately\nhello a few of us were just gathering together for our laughing hour would you care to come laugh with us\nwere you what an idea my friends and i will join you one can always laugh in the bath\noh no no no these are my worlds i protect them i am a master of worlds and they fly only as i wish were having guests for laughing hour would you care to join us\ntheyre friends they love contradiction they thrive on challenge they flourish in conflict\nhe does this everyday usually while everybodys food gets cold its rather boring\nare we ready for the entertainment\ni was just juggling and i happened to catch one in my mouth it tasted good so i ate it before i knew it idea ten up every one of my worlds it never occurred to me that once they were gone id have nothing left to juggle if you ever have a world plan ahead dont eat it\nthat maybe but weve still got over two hundred reports of malfunctioning replicators\nwell wed better look into it whatever it is before the captain decides to order dinner\nyeah dash six four here we are some kind of intermittent em field pattern give me a hand with that will you data theres no plasma leakage just a little negative ion charging\nwhen we opened the panel we discovered that the interface had been transformed into a gelatinous material that we havent been able to identify\ncoming online now\nwere almost there\nthe same thing that happened to the replicator happened to the stabiliser the transfers in both systems were turned into this\nwhatever it is it looks like theres been a conversion process transforming some of the metal into gelatinous residue but what caused it is a mystery\nyes sir and we still dont know why the sensors didnt pick up the problems\nwell it looks like the only alloy common to both the replicator and the stabiliser is ni trium computer analyze the ni trium content of both the affected stabiliser and replicator\naccording to the mass spectrometer the elements in the residue have been broken down into simpler molecular structures\nmay be thats it data if a living organism ingested then i trium\nif thats true if something seating away at the ni trium on the ship that means the dilithium chamber is vulnerable as well as the power transfer conduits wed better get to engineering\nso far these transfer conduits are clean too hold on im getting something here theres a severe energy fluctuation in this access panel\nonce we saw that photonic trail moving through the wall we realised we must be dealing with a metal parasite of some kind\nno sir not that we can tell but we ve got ni trium everywhere the computers the life support the ventilation the engines even the dilithium chamber\nwe should think about going back there the parasites could possibly be lured back to the asteroids for a meal thats more appealing than we are\nthe problem is finding them as soon as we spot an energy fluctuation theyve already consumed all then i trium and have moved on\nprimary power systems are going down ive rerouted to the secondary generators\nlaforge here\nthe parasites must ve gotten into the primary warp controllers captain trying to do a bypass patch to isolate the backup controllers but it looks like warp six is about the best im going to be able to give you\nworking on it sir\nengineering to bridge we ve got warp six point five but i dont know how much more coaxing\nwe can do here\nthe matter antimatter\ninjectors are failing im rerouting to secondary injector power now watch the antimatter containment for any system failure\ndeanna my dear its mother\noh ive got such deliciously exciting news your e going to be absolutely thrilled im getting married\nyou know with just a bit of redecorating here and there this ten forward room should make a very nice wedding hall\nwhere else my little one but here amongst all my good friends and in the presence of my adored daughter\nmy poor plodding little deanna with her questions questions questions wherever did you inherit such pedestrian genes what matters my little one is that your mothers happy\nhes such a wonderful man and he has such good breeding i tell you hes absolute perfection\nhe scampi o third minister to the conference of judges on the planet kos to la in royalty my little one naturally\nwell neither actually you see we have nt exactly met yet really oh but the profiles weve exchanged why they re in such accord that you could weep my little one you would weep at the harmony between us\ndeanna iloveyou but you do make everything sound like an epitaph\nwell of course he sun reasonable hes a child and such a child you know making little boys reasonable only gives them pimples\nalexander what a wonderful name you know i once knew at all handsome warrior named alexander oh he utterly adored me we went everywhere simply everywhere have you been anywhere yet contract what contract\nwell how ghastly for you and your e doing this to your own child mister woof\ncontracts are usually between people who dont really trust one another a child who is trusted becomes worthy of that trust\nand if he does not perform his contractual duties i assume he will be chastised\nand if you fail to perform your duties what is the child supposed to do about it\nalexander now lifes true gift is the capacity to enjoy enjoyment now have i arrived too late or can you still smile\nah my little warrior and how are you this morning ohi see being punished for something are we\nthen your e early thats very responsible of you\nbefore what now if were to be real friends we ve got to share only the truth\nwell for one thing its easier when you tell the truth you never have to remember later what you lied about but mostly a true friend is a person you can always tell the truth to without worrying about it\noh\nthats not very fair is it\nto tell you the truth little warrior neither do i but i do know one marvellous thing we can do with rules\nexactly\nill bet youve never been to a colony of free spirits\nwhatever they want artists philosophers freethinkers and people who dont quite fit other peoples rules personally i come for the mud baths you oh your e going to adore the mud baths computer im assuming you have the parallax colony of shira le avi\noh good then run it for us dear\na wind dancer he stands guard you see only those whose hearts are joyous may enter come

if we know were just here for some fun and a mud bath\nno it doesnt\nwell thats a conversation stopper if i ever heard one\nso my little warrior wants to see more in life than just fighting the mind opens and in creeps wisdom\nof course every one of us has a thousand different kinds of tiny people inside of us and some of them want to get out and bewild some want to be sad or happy or inventive or even just go dancing thats why we all have so many different urges at different times and all those different little people inside us we must never be afraid to take them with us wherever we go i mean who knows when we may need one of them to popup and rescue us from ourselves variety my little alex the great secret is not the variety of life its the variety of us\nlittle one mister woof come join us\ni exposed you to all sorts of mixed messages when you were that age you still turned out deadly dull what are you so worried about\nim letting mister hom n take care of all the mundane details he knows my tastes\ndeanna theres absolutely nothing to do you nosey little girl camp ios already sent me his mothers wedding gown which mister h omnis now altering for me outside of that there really isnt anything else\ncamp io is from a different planet with different traditions he would not approve of a traditional beta zoid wedding so i am happily adapting now its as simple as that i need some tea\noh why canti ever work this replicator\ncomputer some jest r altea please anyway why should nti get married if i choose to you make everything into such a mystery there is no mystery deanna except about this petro kian sausage the tea all i wanted was a cup of tea oh dear i think your replicators having a nervous collapse\nbad enough having to wear anything at my own wedding but this perhaps if we lower the bodice raise the hemline then what a constant joy you are\nmister hom n\nalexander my little warrior come here come on give me a great big hug now youre not escaping another appointment are you\nwell i suppose eventually we all have to live up to our obligations well now tell me what brings you here to brighten my day\nthats very sweet dear but i really wasnt in any trouble until i saw this dress ugly isnt it\nim getting married\nare you sure my daughter didnt send you just a joke people get married because they want to spend their lives with someone\nwell if youre young and lucky it ll be someone you like a lot yes and if youre older\ni malone alex and when you do get older and can no longer pick and choose from whatever may come your way then you do what we call compromise it keeps you from being afraid\nahca mpio my dear your compatibility profile didnt do you justice i ofcourse aml wax ana and any introductory compliments you d care to make will be happily received\nnow that worked just fine\ncamp io may i present my daughter deanna troi meet well your future stepfather come to think of it\ncamp io personally i adore all the ostentation i can get but protocol master\noh yes how very thoughtful\nunpardonable\nwell i certainly dont wish to be considered an tier ko dear but i did promise alexander one more holodeck trip come along my little

so\ninform the bridge mister data with me\nbridge commander do you have any suggestions on how we could encourage the parasites to leave the ship once we reach the pell or is field\nthen they would

member\nnoi means you both agree to your responsibilities and when you ve done the things that youve agreed to do then youve earned the privilege to doing the things that you want to do when he s cleaned his room for instance then perhaps he s earned a visit to the holodeck to fight his alien monsters\ni suggest working out an equitable system with the rules clearly spelled out for the child and the parent you must make a list of your responsibilities too what would you like your father to promise alexander\nwell then you should have no trouble with that part why not go back to your quarters and talk this thing over decide on which points each of you wants in the contract\none day youll learn to be glad your father cared enough about you to insist on rules it may be hard to

empathic metamorph s\nwe learn so quickly what stimulates a man that the second times even better than the first\ni know my role in history commander but its going to be a long voyage\ncome in\ncaptain picard what a delightful surprise come in\nreasonably under the circumstances\nthats true im afraid\nat the request of the ambassador who believes i might be disruptive to your crew\nyou care about my wellbeing thank you captain\nyes i know this ships very important to you isnt it\nare all captains lives so solitary or just yours\nwhat\nim afraid my premature emergence from stasis has left me a little vulnerable to the desires i sense from men nevertheless this is who i am captain you might as well as ka vulcan to forgo logic or a klingon to be nonviolent i can not change and i dont want to until the time has come for me to bond with my permanent mate why does it bother you\nbut thats what gives a metamorph pleasure\nthey are fulfilled by what i give to others\nim incomplete what curious questions captain\nbut you know me better than you realise i am independent forceful brilliant and adventurous exactly as you would have me be captain\nthank you captain captains log stardate 457661 we have reached the designated coordinates for the conference and await the arrival of chancellor al rik\na chaperone\nbut i was hoping we might spend more time together captain\nim very knowledgeable about valt i could be helpful\ni can understand why captain picard chose you to be my chaperone\nive never been topaloriscolony1\nhes just being playful\nwhat are you all having boys2\nthen its mine too\nmister data s protecting me tonight 2\nfrom you i guess i told the captain not to worry i just want to have a good time like anybody else 1\nperhaps the ambassador is right perhaps i should remain in my quarters\ni understand i will volunteer to stay in my quarters under one condition that you will visit me there it is again\nthe wall you put between us\ni said a visit i didnt ask you to make love to me\nventana n thimble early lape on gical period isnt it\nhave you seen the ventana n woven art recovered from the fourth colony dig\nthey say the colours are remarkably vibrant for their age\ni stay informed on a wide variety of subjects after all one never knows when the conversation might turn to ventana n archeology or to the dark woman of raven brows and mournful eyes in shakespeares sonnets or to the gardens of les eyrie s near the village where you grew up\nnot quite that much mister data helped a little\nmy empathic powers can only sense a man of deep passion and conviction so controlled so disciplined i am simply curious to know what lies beneath\nwhen a metamorph finds you interesting do not take it lightly\nwill you visit me\nis that ayes or a no\neven the walls of jericho fell captain\nthere can be only one reason because some part of you wants me to\nthat wont be possible my ability to imprint on a mate will only last a matter of hours after the completion of the fini is ral if i hadnt been removed from stasis prematurely a delay might have been possible but now i will have to bond with al rik within two days\nyou are familiar with the issues\nyou can represent the interests of peace my people will agree im certain of it\ni told you im extremely knowledgeable about val ti will help you prepare kamala\nthats right\nyou still play\nshy\nthankyou for letting down your guard if only for a moment\nwhat is it about me you fear\ndo you find me unattractive\nim being terribly selfish i apologise we have something in common captain when i was a child i took music lessons too\nall of them\nplus a few val tese horns that sound like braying targhee moon beasts they are said to soothe the nerves of val te semen my mother never even heard me play i was taken from her when i was four and sequestered in a royal village where i was prepared to fulfill my destiny\non the contrary i had servants and tutors at my side constantly you once asked me what im like when im alone ive never been there was always somebody there to educate me in literature history art sex but i have been alone on this journey and ive found myself thinking about all the curious questions you asked you wanted to know who i amanda si continue to ask myself the only answer that comes to me is iam for you al rik of valt because thats the truth in a day i will bond with a man ive never met and i will turn myself into what he wants me to be for the rest of my life\nim honoured to be chosen to serve my people as an emissary of peace but i find it ironic on the eve of this ceremony which i have spent my entire life preparing for that i should meet a man like you\nso tell me quickly what is he like\ndid he ask about me\nwhat did you tell him\nwhen ami to be presented\nwould you like some tea\nlet me help you with pronunciations\nplease dont leave talk to me i love the sound of your voice ill turn out the lights and just listen i dont want to be alone\nearl grey tea hot\na starship captain must encounter all sorts of life forms ami one of the most unique youve ever met please say yes\nwhat a nice thing to say\nmay be thats the perfect way to attract a metamorph\nbut your e not other men you could never use me thats the very reason why im with you tonight\nlight years away\ncome in\nis it time\ndo you have any questions about the ceremony\ni will never truly love him\nit no longer matters i wish i could convey to you what its like to be a metamorph to feel the inner strength of someone to realise that being with him is opening your mind and heart to endless new possibilities to hear yourself say i like myself when im with him\nfor a metamorph theres no greater pleasure and no greater wish than to bond with that kind of mate at the end of the fini is ral as ive bonded with you\nwho i am today i will be forever\nwould you ask me to stay and ask two armies to keep fighting having bonded with you ive learned the meaning of duty hell never know im still empathic i will be able to please him i only hope he likes shakespeare\niam for you al rik of valt\nwe ve been working from your drawings ambassador i hope were in the ballpark\ncomputer run holodeck programme k rios one\njust let me know what you need\nlisten have you had a chance to see the dolphins yet\nwe are in no hurry\nperhaps your captain would

a board this ship\na metamorph\nyou do this of your own accord\ncommander riker escort her to quarters theres no need for you to travel in the cargo bay\nbeverly arranged marriages have been the basis of political alliances in many cultures including our own\nshe knows exactly what she s doing\nshe was born to do this\nall right fine good lets throw the prime directive to the winds lets detain her against her will lets destroy any chance of peace between these worlds lets interfere in their society their customs\ni didnt know that\nill talk to her about it\nindeed\nthank you are you comfortable\nit has been brought to my attention that you have been told to remain in here\nagainst your wishes\nthe performance of my crew is none of the ambassadors business\ni care about i care about what happens on board my ship\noh yes oh yes it is\ndont\ndont do this this this you do with men\nfrankly its difficult for me for many of us to easily accept that a sentient being can live only to be what someone else wants them to be\nbut what about your wishes your needs\nand what about when there are no others when you are alone\nunder the circumstances i thought that it would help if i learned more about you\ni will speak to the ambassador about easing your restrictions\nforbid it\nyou can not confine her against her will not on board this ship ambassador she is requesting some freedom of movement and i intend to give it to her\nnot every man\nis hall busy making arrangements for the conference\ni think that you should enjoy the hospitality of the ship mister data here will see to your every comfort if you will excuse me\ni have confidence in the self control of my crew kamala but there are guests and civilians on board\nwhat\nkamala you are one day away from an arranged mating why would you want me to visit you in your quarters\nyes it is\nwoven art recovered intact\nive read about them for years but they were so delicate no one expected to find any preserved how do you know about them\nyour empathic powers told you all this about me\ni see\nnothing nothing lies beneath im really quite dulli fall asleep each night with an old book in my hands\no him not taking it lightly im just trying to be as dull as possible\nit would be inappropriate\nim sorry\nwhy are you doing this kamala\nill advise the val tese delegation that the conference will have to be postponed\nbut there are points in the negotiations that bri am still has to address\nfamiliar yes but i cant represent your peoples interests\nbut there are customs and rituals of which i have no experience at all\nim reminded of piano lessons when i was a child preparing for some dreaded recital\nnoi regret that i gave it up it used to please my mother but i didnt like performing in front of an audience\nno just not very good\nyou will have to help me in the pronunciation of this scroll\nkamala\ni find you unavailable\nreally what instrument\nthe entire orchestra\nit sounds as if it were a very lonely time for you\ni also once asked you if you were doing this of your own accord\ngo ahead number one\nchancellor al rik welcome aboard the enterprise\nhe has not regained consciousness\ni

moment\ni need to talk to a friend\nactually its all your fault\nyou insisted i look into her situation\nthe metamorph kamala ive spent quite a lot of time with her the past few days and your e right about several things but beverly her entire existence has been orchestrated for this moment and she intends to go through with it to help her people end the war\nit isnt that simple i barely know who she is and who she is changes the moment the next man comes into the room and i find myself hoping that the next man wont come in but of course he does and in a few hours the ceremony will begin and she will mate with a man who cares more about trade agreements than he cares about her and i cant help thinking how she will be with him how she will change to accommodate him\nperhaps i just needed a shoulder\nsoon\nmany\nyouve not even met him\nkamala\nwith me\nnot now data\nacknowledged you cant go through with the ceremony\nyour preparations made the negotiations simple ambassador and kamala was able to guide me through the rituals\ncurious\nambassador have a safe trip home\nthat will not be a problem\nwe look forward to enjoying the comforts of your fine ship\nquite acceptable not what were used to you understand but it will do\na pity that was too easy\nthis is a misunderstanding i was looking for a barbershop apparently i made an incorrect turn and\nno ambassador your attitude is quite understandable\nthe bribe is ten thousand more\nwe know the lifestyle of ak rios i an ambassador is far from comfortable\nour money what you drive a hard bargain\nwe must have the metamorph\nwe

to sense the elevated pheromones you were referring to\ncurious isnt exactly how id describe it\nyou mean theres something even more remarkable about you\nlisten this has been educational but i make it a policy never to open another man s gift\nit certainly is well try to make you as comfortable as possible\nriker to bridge if you need me ill be in holodeck four\nill checkin with you later

    "episode 12": "are we to take these strangers at their word\ni suspicious\nnot yet i hear the words but not the sincerity\nafter seven years the great ship enterprise come to repatriate a small group of insignificant people\nyou should listen more carefully excuse me mistress i have matters to attend to elsewhere\nbeat a\n\n\n\ni am beata the elected one of angel one representatives of the starfleet enterprise do you wish to petition\neven a planet as remote as angel one has heard of starfleet searching the galaxy for survivors seems a petty task for one of their mighty vessels\nis this man implying that we put a lesser value on life than you do\ni see and if you find any survivors what then\ngood question\nanother good question\nim not prepared to answer yet see to their comforts\nyou claim you intend to remove these survivors from our planet are you prepared to give us your solemn word on that\nyou should know that the vote was not unanimous some of those among us are suspicious yet the majority feel that we have no choice but to trust you\nmake certain that faith is not misplaced there are four survivors from the ship you call odin all male their leader is a man who calls himself ramsey\nif they were mine to deliver i would do it without hesitation unfortunately their hiding place has long eluded us\nbecause they are fugitives on angel one and the quicker we get rid of them the better when these men came to us seven years ago they accepted our hospitality quickly enough but they gradually became restive started making unreasonable demands went against the natural order\ni assumed as much but be warned counsellor these men are dangerous\nour library is far too sophisticated for a man to comprehend\nan amusing notion maybe you could teach our males a thing or two trent see to the androids needs\nhow handsome you look\nso soon im impressed\nyou had your opportunity to object ariel you were in the minority\nby all means but im sure that counsellor troi and the others can do that without you if i recall you had a gesture of goodwill you wished to give to me\nare you suggesting that the women in your party are incapable of accomplishing their task without the help of a man\nyour every generous with your praise inform them you will remain here with me\nrelax we have much to discuss\nsimply because ramsey and his men are anarchists i had to make sure you werent here to fuel their struggle i like the way your eyes pick up the colour of your tunic\nbut you can interact\nis that why your e here with me tonight to learn\nabout our society\nwell in our society it is the men who are the fortunate ones enjoying all life has to offer while we women devote ourselves to the obligation of making life work\nyoull have to remind me to thank them when they come back for giving us this time\nyou resist dont you find me attractive\nyou attract me like no man ever has\nits not the reason\ni hope so\nyou may go\nvery impressive and now i must repay you in kind\nwhat a refreshing change to be with a man who knows what he wants\nexactly i knew you were bright enough to understand you see women by our very nature want only what is best for their men\nof course theyre not it was merely a figure of speech\nenter\nwhat is so important you find it necessary to intrude upon my privacy\nyour advanced technology has proven inadequate\nyou gave me your solemn word\nim sorry as well since you refuse to take them with you iam left with no choice but to sentence the mall to death\nbefore you go back to your ship theres something i want you to see\nyou brought this upon yourself you and the traitor one does not need the technology of the enterprise to follow mistress ariel sneaking out to warn her husband let her stand with him now for tomorrow they will die together\ni dont expect you to understand\nyoull accomplish nothing with that attitude\nis that not the way of an advanced society\nwill you also include those from this world who unwisely choose to follow ramsey and his group\nwe have determined that the heretical teachings of ramsey and his followers are inconsistent with harmonious life on angel one our patient efforts to silence revolutionary voices have failed therefore we are left with none but the most final alternative\nas you can see we are not without compassion your deaths will be swift and painless\nis this a plea for leniency\nmake your point so we can proceed with this unpleasant business\nstop we will adjourn to consider your words\nafter careful consideration this legislature has voted to stay the execution of the prisoners their children will be returned to them immediately do not rejoice prematurely ramsey and his followers are to be exiled to a distant and unpopulated region life will be difficult there with little time for revolutionary or evolutionary upheaval as some have observed we may be able to stop evolution but perhaps we can reduce it to a slow crawl for a man you can be very clever commander riker\nengineering to bridge\nthe computer wont accept the variant climate controls\nsickbay to captain picard\nwesley and one of his friends have contracted some form of respiratory ailment\ni hope so ive isolated the twelve students who were on the qua zulu eight field trip\nstill running tests the key is to figure out how the virus is transmitted so far ive been able to rule out\nperson to person contact\nyour e infected with the virus captain in my opinion you are no longer physically able to effectively command this vessel\nyou have an appointment in your cabin captain with your bed\nyes\nwe have more sick than we do beds so far ive been forced to confine over three hundred to their private quarters\nthe romulans are your problem lieutenant trying to find an inoculants is mine this virus mutates every twenty minutes but so far we have nt had any fatalities yet\nif this continues lieutenant laforge no one will be healthy enough to care\nit looks horrible tastes worse and its absolutely guaranteed to make you feel better\ni knew you d like it are you wearing cologne like something i smelled earlier something klingon\nits that smell that show the virus travel san airborne particle whose sweet scent inspires deep inhalation and once inside the body it becomes that damned virus i have work to do\nthis is the enterprise crusher here\nhes right here but he sinbad shape\ni cant allow it\nthis virus is totally out of control here until i know exactly what im dealing with icant let anyone new be exposed\nthey might be facing the same thing up here until i have a better idea of what im dealing with no one can be am up im sorry will but you must wait\nnot likely\n\nbingo data\nits also a reference to success data ive got the inoculants\nwelcome home\nslowly but yes\nangel one is a class m planet sir supporting carbon based flora and fauna sparsely populated with intelligent life forms it is similar in technological development to mid twentieth century earth\nfive months fourteen days eleven hours two minutes\nand fifty seven seconds\nangel one has evolved into a constitutional oligarchy it is governed by a parliamentary body consisting of six elected mistresses and headed by a female they refer to as the elected one\na federation vessel last visited this planet sixty two years ago captain\nwhat do we do if they deny the existence of survivors\ninteresting an alcohol based synthetic artificially reproducing a floral scent\nthe purpose of which is\ni am unfamiliar with that term\nhow does stimulation of the olfactory nerves affect the enjoyment of sex\nif we can isolate something unique to the odin survivors perhaps an element not otherwise found on angel one we can utilise the enterprise scanners\ni a man android mistress although anatomically i am a male\na justified precaution counsellor mistress beat a observed that mister ramsey and his men are dangerous\nactually it was quite simple angel one has no platinum enterprise scanners did the rest\nmister ramsey is correct counsellor the odin was not a starship which means her crew is not bound by the prime directive if he and the others wish to stay here there is absolutely nothing we can do about it\ndoctor crusher feels the virus will undoubtedly run unchecked through the entire ship attempts to develop an inoculants have so far ended in failure lieutenant laforge still has bridge command pending your return sir\nthe border outpost reports a contingent of seven romulan battlecruiser s within sensor range the berlin has answered the distress call however should hostilities erupt both the outpost and the starship will be outgunned it is felt that the enterprises presence in the area will be a vital show of force\nexcuse me commander but removing any of these people against their will would be a violation of several starfleet regulations not the least of which would be the prime directive\nthis is data standing by to beam up\n\nto be precise commander you ordered me to reach the neutral zone before it is too late\nafter relieving lieutenant laforge i computed the length of time the border outpost\nand the berlin can safely withstand a romulan attack and deducted our time to destination at maximum warp speed that leaves doctor crusher forty eight minutes to develop an inoculants to the virus\nforty seven sir\ngo ahead doctor\nbingo i fail to see the relevance doctor is that not a reference to an ancient earth game\nexcellent doctor we still have seventeen minutes left i will inform the away team immediately enterprise to riker\nwe are ready to have you beamed up commander\nunderstood commander\ncoordinates set warp six on your mark sir\nsir\nready to begin orbit of angel one

knows the system im sure shell be able to resolve all problems worf thanks for the advice\n\nwere going to be seriously undermanned if were forced to engage the romulans in battle\nif this continues there ll be no one left to run the ship\nenterprise here go ahead\ni suggest you make that on the double tasha we have a real medical emergency brewing up here\none third of the crew is down and the latest information from the neutral zone outpost is that more romulan vessels are converging on that area\nmake it so mister laforge what kind of place is this data\nstarfleet are adamant that we maintain excellent diplomatic relations with this planet mister data is there any other pertinent information before we reply\nhow current is this information mister data\ncounsellor as this is a female dominated society you might wish to make the initial contact\nopen hailing frequencies\nangel ones strategic importance in this quadrant may become vital starfleet s hope is that one day this world may become part of the federation\nenergise captains log supplemental our away team has beamed down to an unusual matriarchal society where the female is as aggressively dominant as the male gender was on earth hundreds of years ago here the female is the hunter the soldier larger and stronger than the male an arrangement considered most sensible and natural\ni want all departments prepared for a warp six trip into the neutral zone as soon as the away team completes its mission\ninsurance romulan battlecruiser s have been detected near one of our border posts\ntheyve requested

captain is fine thank you mister data has been briefing me on the away teams comportment number one\ni look forward to your reports\nindeed we do mister dataset course for the neutral zone warp six\nengage\nwelcome ive been expecting you\nhow did you find me\nplatinum was it my wings i kept them for their sentimental value\noh theyre nearby they repacking as a matter of fact since we can no longer remain here\nwhat is it that you think your e rescuing me from my shipmates and i have all taken wives a few even have children you cant rescue a man from a place that he calls his home\nfive months in a rescue pod no bigger than this room is an eternity i hope none of you will ever have to face when we finally made it here we thought wed died and gone to heaven youve seen the women of the planet theyre tall and strong and lovely but after the newness wore off we started to see how the men were treated theres no votes theres no opinions theres no respect\ndespite their problems lieutenant we happen to like it here on angel one were not going anywhere\nmistress beata be damned her wish is not my command and neither is yours you cant force us to go\ni cant answer that\ntheyre gone\nwe were no harm to anyone why did you tell them where to find us\nthats very kind of you but were not going\nwe dont want to die we dont want to leave either\nthank you\nassuming any of the survivors made it this far admittedly it is the closest planet to the odin but to travel distance we did in two days at warp one would have taken the odin escape pod five months\nthank you data\nwhere re you fellows off to\nsave us some deep powder\nthe away teams ready sir\nwell do our best to make a good impression sir\nwe dont consider even one survivor petty\nare there survivors from the freighter odin on your planet\nwhats going on\nis thus are a secure can we talk\ngood troi\nparanoia id say but of what\ni agree otherwise why would they be so circumspect\nlets not look for problems\nan aphrodisiac is something used to stimulate or enhance sexual pleasure\nwe dont understand the source of your misgivings mistress but we appreciate your faith in us\ndata whats the best way to go about finding ramsey and the other survivors\nmister data will need access to your library\ngood its for my meeting with beat a\nof course part of this mission is diplomatic i have requested an audience with ahead of state and i will honour her by wearing indigenous apparel\nwhy what is this attitude on kabat risi had to wear furs to meet the leadership council and on arm us nine i wore feathers this objection doesnt have anything to do with the fact that beata is a woman and an attractive one does it\nwhat do you think\nthank you lieutenant actually it feels quite comfortable\nthank you the enterprise reports a possible location for mister ramsey and the other survivors\nyou dont believe me\nmistress ariel i hear the words but not the sincerity\nwith your permission wed like to begin our search immediately\ncertainly that can wait until weve recovered the survivors\nnot at all lieutenant yar and counsellor troi are completely qualified\nriker to lieutenant yar\nin the interests of diplomatic relations ill remain here with mistress beat a while you conduct our search\nyou have your instructions\nwhy were you so hesitant at first to tell us about the odin survivors\nits not our position to interfere in the domestic affairs of other societies\nof course otherwise how can we learn\nyes\nyes\nin our society we share the responsibilities and the pleasures equally which is why i am able to be here with you while the women of the away team go to find ramsey\nyes i find you very attractive\nits not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader of another world\nno its not but will you still respect me in the morning\nthank you trent\ncompliments of the enterprise its called anal beni meditation crystal\nand doesnt have to be told by a woman\nmen are not objects to be possessed mistress beat a\nwhat happened tasha\nim sorry theres nothing else we can do\nwhats the latest on the enterprises medical situation\nand what about the romulans entering the neutral zone\ni think its time we to leave this place\nshe has to find them first ramsey and his bunch have been fugitives for years i suspect hes pretty good at evading capture\nyou claim to be an advanced society and yet you resort to executions in order to suppress those who dont share your views\nwhy because im only a man\nmistress beat a if you had an alternative to the execution of ramsey and his followers would you take it\nthen let us meet with the men from odin one last time let me try to convince them to leave with us\nyes all of them\ntheres no time to debate the issues your e going with us whether you choose to go or not\ni realise that mister data id rather face a court martial than live with the guilt of leaving these people to their deaths commander riker to enterprise\ndoctor where is lieutenant laforge\nnotify the transporter room i have fourteen to beam up\ndoctor these people are facing their deaths down here\nunderstood doctor would this virus have any effect on mister data\nyour e going back there alone i want you to get the enterprise into the neutral zone before its too late\ni dont know deanna\nyou send mistress beat a our regrets\nriker here data i gave you direct orders to get to neutral zone immediately explain the delay\nforty eight minutes\nperhaps data perhaps thank you\nfor following my orders so precisely data\non second thought trent we would be honoured to witness your moral imperative in action\nmistress beat a before we see living examples of your compassion may i speak\nnothing of the sort as the governing body of angel one your e entitled to execute your laws or your citizens as you see fit\nwhen you spoke of the prisoners you used the term revolutionary indeed death has been known to stop

anybody\ni spent two weeks on that that was really mean\nclara theres no such thing as invisible people you relying\nhey\ni like to cook all kinds of stuff like yogurt and raisin salad chocolate chip

planting the seeds first\nlike what\nwed better finish planting first i promised keiko\nid better ask my daddy\nim clara sutter thats my daddy\nbut isabella wanted to see engineering\nbut daddy\nwhy do you keep disappearing like that\nwhere did you go\nthats the door to the cargo bay we cant go in there\nokay isabella why are you so serious lately\nyou havent even smiled once today\nyour e my best friend isabella\ni dont know because we do things together and we trade secrets\nif they re lucky before i had you i didnt have one\neverytime i made friends with someone my daddys job would change and wed move to a new ship it takes time to make a best friend\nit depends with you not very long you always listened to me even when i was sad\nrace you\nready set go\nwe were only playing were sorry\nthank you come on\nnoi brought isabella to see ten forward\nthank you\njust one please isabella isnt thirsty\nyour e not like the other grownups\nthey dont think isabella s real\nwhy\nlike what\nif the other grownups dont understand how come you do\nyou did what was she like\nwhat was he like\nit\nsounds scary\nso is isabella\nhello\ni guess so bye\ni know that i didnt want to go but isabella wanted to see it\ni try to but she doesnt listen\nshes over there\nshe said\nshe said you d better leave us alone\nthats okay\nhere you can help me put this together if you want\ntheyre not mean they re just more serious than we are\nyou do\nwere not allowed to go there\nwe are\ni told you\nthats not true\nwho is it\nhi\ncan isabella come too\nwell okay\nive never made a cup before how do you make the round part\nyou did\ni think we need more water\nisabella\ni didnt do it\nit was isabella\nshes invisible\ni didnt do it i didnt\nisabella stop\nwhy were you being so mean to me why d you do that to my friend\nyour e scaring me\nshe said they were going to come and kill everyone\nthe others like her\nbut she s not imaginary anymore shes real now i can see her\nyes\ni think so\nmay be what about in the closet\nits about isabella\ni think her feelings were hurt she said she liked me she liked being with me she was my friends he only got mean when i stopped paying attention to her\nbut daddy\nyes captain\nisabella isabella dont you want to talk to me im not mad at you isabella\nim scared isabella\nplease dont hurt us if you still want to be my best friend id like that very much\nthats okay\nfor a while you were\nim sorry i have to go away\ni hope so\nand then after dinner then what\nthe neural scanner still seems to be a bit off lets check the sensor

beautiful\nclaras sleeping shes going to be fine her bioelectrical processes were severely disrupted its as if the energy were pulled right out of her body\nin order for the lateral sensors to complete their scheduled observations additional processing time will be required\nwill two hours be enough time to complete the high resolution series on the neutron star\nthe rotational period of the neutron star is one point three five seconds\ngiven the selections i prefer four seven\nshields have registered an impact however sensors show nothing in the vicinity\nthe drag coefficient continues to increase our velocity has fallen by twelve percent velocity is increasing ships speed has stabilised at one quarter impulse\ni did nothing the problem seems to have corrected itself\nwe have simulated several such fields but were unable to reproduce the same drag coefficient\nsince we have only experienced the phenomenon once it is impossible to estimate the risks\ni believe what you are seeing is the effect of the fluid dynamic processes inherent in the large scale motion of highly rarified gas\nwhere\ni do not see it it is interesting that people try to find meaningful patterns in things that are essentially random i have noticed that the images they perceive sometimes suggest what they are thinking about at that particular moment besides it is clearly a bunny rabbit\nsir as we move deeper into the nebula sensors indicate that the levels of helium and trio nium are continuing to rise\nno sir we are well with intolerance levels\nshields have registered an impact\nthere is no indication of anything near the ship\nuntil we determine the cause of the drag coefficient i would not recommend it sir\nthe drag coefficient is still present but it has stabilised\nit is an irregular lattice composed of approximately forty seven million strands of energy\nit may be difficult siri am detecting a significant number of strands behind us\nat our current speed we will clear the nebula in twelve minutes four seconds\nwe are moving through a dense concentration of energy strands\ncaptain density appears to be lower off the starboard bow\nit appears to be an energy vortex of highly complex patterns possibly a life form\nit is indirect physical contact with our shields\naye sir no effect\naye sir\naye sir impulse engines now at full power\naye sir\naye sir\nwe ve got elevated quantities of hydrogen helium and trio nium but nothing the shields cant handle\nwhy dont we call it sutters cloud\nwhat was that\nits as a marian coral fish with its fin unfolded\nno no first it was a fish and now its a minton ian sailing ship\nright there dont you see the two swirls coming together to form the mast\nlooks as though someones lost their way excuse me hello are you looking for someone\nohi see well ordinarily we would only let you in with a grown up but since youve brought isabella you can be my guest wont you join me\nnow how about two papal la juices with extra bubbles\none juice\noh no\nwell most grownups have a hard time with things they cant see\nwell because they get preoccupied by other things\nlike how much fuel it takes to power a ship or whether we should go to one star system or another or whether little girls should go to bed at seven or be allowed to stay up till eight so their heads can get so full that they forget about the things that are important to you and me like imaginary friends\nmaybe because when i was your age i had one\nit wasnt as he\nit was nta he\nit was at ark assian razor beast it had dark brown fur and gold eyes and huge spiny wings and it would fly so fast nobody could see it except me\noh it was especially when he smiled but the best thing about him was i could curl up on his furry belly and he had the softest purr you ever heard it put me right to sleep every night i tell you that razor beast was a good friend\nclara and isabella and i were just having a conversation\nbye clara bye isabella\nis something wrong with the cake\nwell i see you sitting here with a piece of untouched chocolate cake in front of you i assume some things wrong with the cake or some things bothering you\nlet me guess about the little girl with the imaginary friend\nhow so\nbut\nwell im not sure about that i was just telling clara about my imaginary friend\nat ark assian razor beast it protected me i knew as long as that razor beast was around nothing could hurt me you know over the years his body kind of faded away but the idea stayed and i just dont seem to talk to him as often as i used to\noh yeah when im afraid ori get confused or a little scared i just dont think you should have to give up an imaginary friend\nhello\nhello clara\nis something wrong with the way i look\nwell now you can see me for real doesnt that make you happy\ncan we go now\nim tired of planting lets do something else\nlike i would really like to explore the ship\nwe can finish later lets go look around\nyour daddy wont mind we can tell him later come on\nthe grownups dont believe im real when they re around i have to be invisible wait here\nthere was something i had to do\nwhats in here\nlets go someplace with a lot of people\nwhat do you mean\nwhy\ndoes everybody have a best friend\nwhy not\nhow long\nclara im glad were best friends\nokay\nare you mad at me im sorry i got you in trouble\nare we still best friends\nclara why are grownups some an\nsometimes i wish they would just go away\nyes i dont like them im bored lets go back to engineering\ni thought we were best friends\nthen why wont you play with me\nyou always listen to the grownups you dont care about me\ni thought wed have fun together once you could really see me i thought you d like me lets go to engineering clara just for a little while no one will know it ll be our secret and if they find us well tell them we got lost\nclara\nbecause you ran away from me you left me alone i had to do everything by myself\ni was going to protect you clara i liked you but now i dont care now when the others come you can die along with everyone else\ni came here to determine whether you were a threat to us and to examine the purity of your energy sources\nyes the emissions from your graviton field generators are far richer than our normal sources of energy\nyou should be destroyed you are cruel uncaring creatures\nthe way you treat clara\nyou wouldnt let her do what she wanted to or go where she wanted to\nwhat difference does it make\ni wouldnt have let anything happen to her\nthat was only after you told clara not to be my friend\ni came to say im sorry i frightened you\nand i misled you i wasnt really your isabella\ni never had a friend before\ndo you think youll ever come back\nso do

engineering team while they re recalibrating the thermal interferometer y scanner\nno problem well just double up the main sensor bandwidth while they re freeing up the lateral unit\nso what are we going to name this nebula forty seven just doesnt have the proper ring to it\nthats a bit on the long side sutter lets see if you can get a reading on the particle flux\ni was thinking about something more along the lines of the laforge nebula its got sort of a majestic sound dont you think\nit felt like we hit something\ncould be something wrong with the shields captain were checking it out now\nso did we hit something or not shields say yes sensors say no this is very strange ensign give me a break down on shield energy conversion and then run a spectral whoa where did you come from\ni hear you captain im increasing the power to the impulse engines but forward velocity just isnt consistent with engine output\nit seems like theres something increasing the drag coefficient on the ship\nbut we cant find the source\ngive me a couple of minutes here captain\nthats great data what d you do\ni dont have an explanation captain we seemed to hit something then we started losing speed so far as we can tell theres nothing out there to hit\nand we still dont know why the problem suddenly corrected itself\nthe question is do we stay here and check it out\ncaptain id like to stay here for a little bit collect some samples of the gaseous matter see what it tells us\nokay ive configured the magnetic coil to collect samples of gaseous matter from the nebula go ahead and activate the beam emitter\nwell take samples from eight random sections that ought to give us a reliable measure\ntwo of them as a matter of fact my father was anexo zoologist my mother a command officer\nthats putting it mildly they were always on the move some of the time together sometimes separately i never knew whether or not i was going to be stationed with my father while he studied invertebrates in the mode an system or on some outpost near the neutral zone with my mom\ni dont remember it that way\nwell i suppose there were aspects of my childhood that were less than ideal but to me it was just one long adventure children are a lot stronger than you think as long as they know you love them they can handle just about anything life throws at them you know\nyeah take a look at this we tried radiating the subject matter with just about everything we could think of we didnt find anything until we subject edit to a high frequency warp field we think this is what we ve been running into\nwe think so now that the sensors can read it it seems to be a highly cohesive form of plasma like a strand of energy\nwhen these things come in contact with our shields it produces a resonant effect and that creates the drag coefficient we ve been experiencing\nno sir\nno but if we run the warp field generators through the deflector grid we could radiate a field outside the ship\ncaptain we should be able to illuminate any strands within two thousand kilometres of the ship\ninitiating field generation\ncaptain with this many of them the resonant effect on our shields could cause a problem\nthe stress on the hull would be too great\nstrand density is ten times what it was captain we cant take many more of these hits\nwe ve got about eight minutes before this thing drains our shields\naye sir\nwe went to the holodeck and took a walk on the champs elysees\nill run a diagnostic\nand\nhe has shore leave next month he asked me to go to risa with him\ni dont think im going doctor i hear its

destroy us\nwhat makes you say that\nin what way have we mistreated her\nyou mean where you wanted her to\nyou were taking her to places that were inappropriate even dangerous\nwe didnt know that we didnt even know if you were real all we knew was that a little girls imaginary friend was frightening her threatening her\ni understand you are seeing this ship all of us from a unique perspective from a childs point of view it must seem terribly unfair and restrictive to you as adults we dont always stop to consider how everything we say and do shapes the impressions of young people but if youre judging us as a people by the way we treat our children and i think there can be better criterion then you must understand how deeply we care for them when our children are young they dont understand what might be dangerous our rules are to keep them from harm real or imagined and thats part of the continuity of our human species when clara grows up she will make rules for her children

afraid shes not making any real friends she spends all of her time with isabella\nyour e probably right\nwhy dont we call it sutters cloud\naye sir\nwhat was that\nsystems are normal sir\nclara you cant be here right now\ni dont care what isabella wanted to see you go back to our quarters right now\nclara now\nim sorry commander\nim setting the fraction ater to a continuous cycle\ncommander i understand that you had a parent who was in starfleet\nthey must have been posted to a lot of different assignments\nwas that hard on you\nit must have been disruptive if you didnt stay in one place

network of much larger strands\nensign sutter to counsellor troi\nwould you come to my quarter sim having a problem with clara\nshe wont even go into her room shes terrified that isabella s going to hurt her\ncaptain clara has told me that her imaginary friend has been making threats she claimed that others were on the way and that they had plans to kill everyone on the ship\nwhat about her clara\ndid she say when the others were coming all right thanks sweetie you go back to bed now well handle this\nhere honey\npurple omelettes\ni can see her point sugar with your tea\nisabella would you like some too\nill bet isabella is very pretty\nmaybe you could draw me a picture id love to see what she looks like\ni think she s real for you and that is real enough for me\nis that so\ni hope i see you soon maybe we can be friends\nyes\nwhy thank you isabella\ni can understand your concern ensign sutter but really you have nothing to worry about its a normal healthy activity for children to engage in imaginary play\nyou ve been moving from starship to starship since clara was two years old may be isabella provides a constant companion she knows this is one friends he wont have to leave behind\ngive clara a chance as she learns to make friends on the enterprise youll probably find that shell leave her imaginary world behind captains log stardate 458521 the enterprise has arrived at four seven a nebula which has formed around a neutron star we are eager to investigate this unique formation\nhello clara\nwould you and isabella like to come for a walk with me\nclara you havent been on this she very long so maybe you dont know but ten forward is usually for grownups\nif isabella is making you do things you know are wrong then you must tell her its not acceptable\ndeck thirtytwo clara do you want me to talk to isabella\nisabella its not very nice to get clara to do things that she isnt supposed to\nfrom now on i want you to ask a grown up before you go to any place that is off limits\nwhat does she say\nclara please tell me what isabella said\nim a little concerned at the turn this is taking it seems clara is beginning to do inappropriate things and blaming the mon isabella\ni dont think its too serious yet but we should make more of an effort together involved with real friends her own age the childrens centres having a ceramics class this afternoon why dont i take clara\nill see if there s any room left in the class in the meantime i think you should make yourself more available to clara let her knows he doesnt have to rely on isabella when she needs someone to talk to\ncounsellor troi\nhello clara\ni came to ask if you d like to go to a ceramics class\nno lets do something with isabella another day\nalexander i thought you might like a

next week\nexcuse me\nim sure the cake is fine ive just been thinking\nim wondering if im doing the right thing\nwell i know the best thing to do is to gradually we an her away from her fantasy and

a few diagrams and ask you some questions about them its very simple really\nyou mean our names we dont have designations we have name sim beverly this is geordi\nim beverly hes geordi and you\nyou\nokay now im beverly\nnow imagine what this shape would look like if it were turned inside out which one is it\nthats right hes gotten everyone eight out of eight that blows the top right off the spatial acuity percentiles\nlike some kind of holographic imaging system\nhugh do you understand we dont want to be assimilated\nbecause we dont want to live the way you do\ni think what your e saying is that your e lonely\nbut if we erase his memory who he is or who he has become would be destroyed\nis there any danger that the borg might destroy him if they find out whats happened\ni have a question what if he doesnt want to go back\ngoodbye hugh it was nice getting to know you\nbut captain they kidnapped you\ncaptain i am detecting a transmission emanating from within the system\nit is self repeating of unknown pattern\na small moon orbiting the fourth planet\nindeterminate i am attempting to screen out sensor interference readings are still inconclusive however the moons atmosphere is capable of supporting life\nsir there is no indication of other borg activity within sensor range\ntheborg are extremely computer dependent a systems failure will destroy them\nthe vessel is traveling at warp seven points ix mass two point five million metric tons configuration cubical\nits dimensions indicate that it is a scout ship similar to the one that crashed interference from the stars radiation will shield us from their sensors we should remain undetected until they enter the system\nat present speed they will arrive in thirty one hours seven minutes\nthe shape is a paradox sir it can not exist in real space or time\nhe will be unsuccessful and will store the shape in his memory banks it will be shunted to a subroutine for further analysis\nit is designed so that each approach they take will spawn an anomalous solution the anomalies are designed to interact with each other linking together to form an endless and unsolvable puzzle\nwe are now entering position radiation levels are rising\nsolar radiation is rendering our sensors inoperable at last known course and speed theborg vessel should enter the system in three minutes\ni dont think i like this sport\nah but if i lift up you lunge right underneath lets face it youre just better at this thani ami understand we have a guest on board\nis that wise\ni thought i understood you picard but i dont understand this\ntheyre going to come after us you know that you of all people know that\nyou felt sorry for me look what it got you\nhugh\nyou named the borg\noh so now you have a borg named hugh\nhow so\ndo you know that your e the second person today to refer to that borg as though it were some sort of lost child\nlet me tell you something when that kids big brothers come looking for him theyre not going to stop until they find him and then they re going to come looking for us and they will destroy us and they will not do any of the soul searching that you are apparently doing right now\nbecause i wouldnt have anything to say\nyou dont look so tough\narent you going to tell me you have to assimilate me\nno but thats what you things do isnt it\nresistance is futile\nit isnt my people resisted when the borg came to assimilate us some of us survived\nno but thanks to you there are very few of us left were scattered throughout the galaxy we dont even have a home anymore\nwhat\nare you sure you look like your e preparing for a quiet evening\nno thankyou i was thinking about how you said the other day that my foil was dipping that i should get some exercise and strengthen my arm\nand bartending about the borg arent you the least bit surprised by him\ndid you know he has a name laforge gave it to him his names hugh and hes lonely i dont know what made me go see him laforge said i should but i said no and suddenly there i was standing there staring at him i thought it was just curiosity just curious i need to hear you say that you are sure your e doing the right thing\nno i think i need you to persuade me\nno but when you talk to him face to face can you honestly say you dont have any doubt\nwhy not\nif youre going to use this person\nif you are going to use this person to destroy his race you should at least look him in the eye once before you do it because i am not sure he is still a borg\nfine but if you dont talk to him at least once you may find that decision a harder to live with than you realise\nlaforge here\nill set up a subspace damping field around the detention cell\nthey contain relatively straightforward programming interface protocols we have the files we downloaded after your experience captain i think i can manage it\nim not sure sir the subroutines are pretty complicated id probably have to study the data processing algorithms its the only way i could trace the access codes\ntheborg are so interconnected it would act like a virus\nif this works the way i think it will once the invasive programme starts spreading itll only be a matter of months before the borg suffer total systems failure\nhes emitting a homing signal and a second subspace beacon but our damping field is blocking both signals\naye sir\nill have to adapt a power conduit and install it in there\nill have to go in to connect the power conduit\ngood now stay that way\njust look around pal your e hardly in a position to make any demands\nwhos we\nyeah but there s only one of you do you have a name a means of identification\nthere were five on your ship is that it just a number\nit does kind of suit you okay this is for you it regulates the power flow to the frequency that your e used to this connection should fit the coupling on your arm your e welcome lets get out of here\nhes hungry all right\nim just a nice guy at heart you feeling better\nthats right and i hope to stay that way\nthats gratitude for you\nive been rationing his portions of energy i think he understands when he cooperate she gets fed if not\nlook if im going to figure out his command pathways i need to learn how he processes information and the only way i know to do that is by giving him perceptual tests and for that i need his cooperation\ndoctor\nokay i think were ready to transport him if he gives us any trouble we can access the force field through that console are you ready\nlaforge to transporter room three were ready here\nenergise\nthird of five this is doctor crusher doctor crusher this is third of five\nyeah\nyeah thats right listen third of five doctor crusher here has repaired a lot of the damage to your biochip implants we want to run a few tests make sure everything s working okay\nyes but before that happens could we ask you a few questions\nterrific all right hang on just a second here third of five\ndesignation\ndo you want one\nno no wait a minute thats it hugh what do you think\nno not you hugh\nim geordi\nits the prosthetic eye it seems to be giving him very complex visual information\nthat could be helpful hugh id like to take a closer look at your eyepiece is that okay\nthanks\nother voices\nhere\nweller well send you home\nyou know its funny when i first creating this invasive programme i didnt have a problem with it the more iwork with hugh the more i\nthats what we call him\nwell it was easier to have something to call him\nright and hes nothing like what i expected\ni dont know its like he s just some kid who s far way from home\nanyway im having second thoughts about what were doing here i mean programming him like some sort of walking bomb sending him back to destroy the others\nthen why dont you go and talk to him it might not be so clear cut then\nthen why dont you just listen that is what you do best isnt it\nim studying the components in your prosthesis\nwere trying to learn more about you\nbecause your e different than we are part of what we do is to learn more about other species\nyeah i know\nmaybe it is its just not what we do\nall right think of it this way everytime you talk about yourself you use the word we we want this we want that you dont even know how to think of yourself as a single individual you dont say i want this or iam hugh we are all separate individuals i am geordi i choose what i want to do with my life i make decisions for myself for somebody like me losing that sense of individuality is almost worse than dying\nno\nsometimes but thats why we have friends\nsure someone you talk to who will be with you when your e lonely someone who makes you feel better\nthats it captain\nwe had to disguise it as something innocuous theborg have ways of screening out programme anomalies\nwhen hughs imaging apparatus imprints this on his biochip shell try to analyse it\nthen when the borg download his memory it ll be incorporated it into their network then they ll try to analyse it\nnot until the shape has gone through several hundred computational cycles\nabout another twenty hours doctor crusher wants to make sure the new implants have taken hold\ncaptain i have to admit ive been having second thoughts about this plan\nwell ive been getting to know him theborg\nhes not what i expected captain hes got feeling shes homesick i dont know it just doesnt seem right using him this way\naye captain\nso youve reconsidered the plan\ndoes that seems right to help him become an individual and then take that away from him\nhello hugh\nits not irrelevant hugh it matters to us\ndont you understand hugh were giving you a choice\nyes a choice do you want to go back with the borg or stay with us\nhugh think about this are you sure\nhugh its not too late to change your mind\ncaptain id like to go down with him\nwe found you there in the middle of that debris\nwell i guess this is it huh so long hugh\nwhere is it coming from\nlife signs\ngo ahead number one\naway team prepare to return to the ship\nyour concern is noted doctor but any intervention on our part would alert the borg to our having been here\nsecurity measures must be taken before we beam it on board\nmister data notify security to prepare a detention cell bridge to engineering\nwere bringing a borg survivor on board well need to neutralise the homing signal\nprevent it from sending or receiving transmissions of any kind\nvery well\npicard to riker\nwe are transporting you directly to the detention cell\nthe cell doctor whatever equipment you need will be brought to you there\ncome\ni dont think so counsellor\nim quite recovered from my experience thank you\ncounsellor counsellor i very much appreciate your concern for me but i can assure you it is quite misplaced i have carefully considered the implications of having a borg on this ship i have weighed the possible risks and i am convinced that we are doing the right thing now i am quite comfortable with my decision\nis hall certainly avail myself of your help\ntheborg will die if they re removed permanently their brains grow dependent on the biochips\nmister laforge do you know enough about borg programming to alter the pathways to their root command structure\nif we could get to the root command we could introduce an invasive programming sequence through its biochip system and then return it to the hive\nwhich would infect the entire collective we could disable their neural network at a stroke\nquite right doctor if all goes well a terminal one\ncomments\nwhich under most circumstances would be unconscionable but as i see it theborg leave us with little choice\ntheyve declared war on our way of life we are to be assimilated\nthink of them as a single collective being theres no one borg who is more an individual than your armor your leg\nyour point doctor\nit comes down to this were faced with an enemy who are determined to destroy us and we have no hope of negotiating a peace unless that changes we are justified in doing anything we can to survive\npicard here\nacknowledged we proceed with the plan\nhes trying to find an access terminal so he can interface with the collective he doesnt understand that the signal has been cut off\nhes alone for the first time he s being forced to cope with his environment without the resources of the collective\narrange to feed it\nlast week when you scored two touches you liked it well enough today you were dropping your foil you kept letting me inside\nyes\nim not sure i hope so\nit was an errand of mercy he was injured doctor crusher decided for humanitarian reasons to care for him\nshall we go again\nare you all right\nwhat is it number one\nanalysis\nhow long do we have\nit looks harmless enough\nhow can a geometric form disable a computer system\nquite original how long before a total systems failure\nwhen can you begin the process\nvery well begin as soon as your e ready\nin what way\ni see\ncenturies ago when laboratory animals were used for experiments scientists would sometimes become attached to the creatures this would a problem if the experiment involved killing them i would suggest that you un attach yourself from the borg mister laforge\nguinan please come in\nno im delighted to see you can i get you something to drink\nwell a strong forearm is certainly an advantage in fencing\nsurprised\nif youre here to persuade me not to use the invasive programme\ntwo days ago you were so upset about the borg even being on the ship that you to remy foil out of my hand and now youre here questioning whether it should be treated as the enemy\ni havent talked to it\ni saw no need\nits not a person damnit its a borg\nbecause its been given a name by a member of my crew doesnt mean its not a borg because its young doesnt mean that its innocent it is what it is and in spite of efforts to turn it into some kind of peti will not alter my plans\nyes lieutenant\nproceed\nlieutenant you may wait outside\nyes i am locutus of borg\nthis is a primitive culture i am here to facilitate its incorporation identify yourself\nidentify yourself\nthis is not a borg identification\nthis culture will be assimilated\nirrelevant\nresistance is futile\nthey will be found it is inevitable all will be assimilated\nyes\nthen he will die\nyou will assist us to assimilate this vessel you are borg you will assist us\nwhat did you say\ni\nbut you are borg\ni think i deliberately avoided speaking with the borg because i didnt want anything to get in the way of our plan but now that i have he seems to be a fully realised individual he has even accepted me as picard captain of this ship and not as locutus\nyes to use him in this manner wed be no better than the enemy that we seek to destroy so i want other options\ni doubt it the red be nothing to gain its more likely that they would simply wipe out his memory of those experiences\nbut perhaps in that short time before they purge his memory the sense of individuality which he has gained here might be transmitted throughout the entire borg collective every one of the borg being given the opportunity to experience the feeling of singularity perhaps thats the most pernicious programme of all the knowledge of self being spread throughout the collective in that brief moment might alter them forever we leave his memory intact\nhugh a borg rescue vessel is approaching it will be here within three hours we can return you to the crash site where they will find you and take then you home or if you wish you can stay here with us\nwell well deal with the repercussions later we must know what you want\nwe could grant you asylum hugh\ntheborg ship will enter orbit in one hour youll soon be headed home well beam him down and then well take up a position in the stars chromosphere the interference will hide us from their sensors\nmy experience suggests that they would ignore him would you agree\nbecause they needed a liaison to communicate with humans they ignored every away team we sent to their ship including yours

thought having a borg on the ship would stir some feelings\nsometimes even when a victim has dealt with his assault there are residual effects of the event that linger you were treated violently by theborg kidnapped assaulted mutilated\ni see well if at any point you want to talk more\nnot from us but certainly from them theyve attacked us in every encounter\nkill it now make it appear that it

sir\nwe shouldnt make any hasty decisions jean luc the transporter couldve beamed them somewhere else the romulan ship another deck of the enterprise\nwe should check again there might be something that weve overlooked and\nyour e right i just hate making out death certificates does ensign ro have any family ro\nill have the official reports ready within the hour ro\nlook around you data

captain sensors are unable to locate them anywhere within transporter range\naye sir\nexcuse me sir\ncaptain the diagnostic of the transporter system shows an anomalous energy fluctuation i will need to inspect the imaging scanner in transporter room three\ncaptain i have a personal favour to ask i considered commander laforge to be my best friend i believe it is my responsibility to plan and conduct the memorial service may i have your permission to do so\nthank you sir\ni believe the cause of the accident may be related to the explosion on the romulan ship\nin all likelihood the explosion damaged the romulan cloaking device causing it to discharge chron it on particles i am detecting a chron it on field in here\ni suspect they travelled through the transporter beam that may have been the cause of geordi andros death i will go to the romulan ship perhaps i can discover the source of the emissions\nthey pose no danger to humans however some of the ships systems may be affected by prolonged exposure when i return i will devise a method to eradicate them\nlieutenant i am planning a memorial service for commander laforge and ensign roi would like you to participate\ncaptain picard asked me to arrange a ceremony that was appropriate i have given a great deal of thought as to what is appropriate in this instance\nhold position here\ni find i am having difficulty deciding what kind of service to have do you have any suggestions\nensign row as bajoran her beliefs should be reflected as well however their death rituals are quite complicated ro\ni am not certain that either human or bajoran rites are fitting and i have researched the funerary customs of over five thousand cultures to no avail\nresume course in almost all societies it is traditional to say a ritual farewell to those you call friends i never knew what a friend was until i met geordi he spoke to me as though i were human he treated me no differently from anyone else he accepted me for what i am and that i have learned is friendship but i do not know how to say goodbye ro\nwhy\nbegin docking procedure\nchron it on emissions may have been responsible for the accident which claimed the lives of our officers\nwas your cloaking device damaged in the explosion\nthat explains the chron it on fields i am detecting in here now for your own safety it is important to eliminate those emissions\nthere is no way to predict what will happen when the chron i tons interact with the new engine core\nthe field emissions are particularly strong in this area\nthis is puzzling three more chron it on fields have formed aboard the enterprise in the last hour\nwe should begin decontamination immediately run an internal sensor sweep for locations of all chron it on fields on the enterprise\ni do not understand how these new fields have formed no transporter beam has been active in any of those areas i can not see that they have anything in common\nin fact they seem to be appearing at random\ncan you narrow the focus of the scan to pinpoint the locations\ngo to science station two on the main bridge use a lateral sensor array to get a more precise reading i will modify an anyone mitter to eliminate the fields once they ve been isolated\ndata here\nacknowledged\nexcuse me for interrupting lieutenant\nim detecting a chron it on field in your room may i scan the area\ndo you think the others will think this service appropriate\ni am glad you approve doctor\ngo ahead chief\nno\nno anyone missions are harmless please begin immediately\ni see no reason to de la your departure the chron it on fields have been cleared from all critical areas\ncurious captain i believe we should decontaminate this room before getting underway\nchief\nincrease anyone missions to six thousand particles per second and decontaminate this area\nyes sir\ni believe i may know what has happened sir\nit would explain the mysterious chron it on fields ro\nif they were

im really glad that you can see me its like im here but im not herero\ni cant figure it out one minute we were transporting from the romulan vessel and the next i wake up in the arboretum with a splitting headache can you pass through things like bulkheads ro\nwell were solid enough to each other ro\nwhat do you mean ro\nwhat ro\nis that some kind of a joke ro\nwait a minute what are you saying that were some sort of spirits ro\nbut my uniform my visor are you saying im some blind ghost with clothes ro\nwe are not dead ro\nno you may be ready for the afterlife but im not ro\nfine you go make peace with yourself all right im going to transporter room three im going to figure a way out of this situation\nreally\na chron it on field\nthe transporter beam\nlaforge to ensign roro\nhey there you are excuse me captain listen data staking the next shuttle over to the romulan vessel and we need to be o nitro\nbecause i think what happened to us the answers are over there ro\nlook if youre right then were dead and this doesnt make any difference but if im right then were still alive and im going to need your help\nthis is weird listening to them plan our funeral\ndata thats a nice sentiment but a little premature i dont plan on being commemorated before my time\nive never seen anything like this theres something in here that looks like a molecular phase inverter ro\nits supposed to change the structure of matter so it can pass through normal matter and energy hang on a second a few years back we got intelligence reports that the klingons were working on trying to combine a phase inverter and a cloaking device in theory they believed that a phased ship could hide anywhere even inside a planet and that conventional weapons would be useless against it ro\nit never got out of the preliminary stages there were several accidents the romulans might be pursuing the same technology trying to combine an inverter and a cloaking device and if this is the prototype ro\nand usr o\nnot just cloaked phased our entire molecular structure altered so that we dont have any substance ro\nyes it would also mean that there s probably a way to de phase us\nwe ve got to get to the enterprise and warn the mro\ni dont know but we have to find away come on ro\nthe romulans must be hiding it in a sensor return signal unless someone runs a level three diagnostic they d never detect it there must be a way to warn them before the ship goes to warp\ntheres no reason why the interphase device would be producing new fields aboard this ship\nro look at this\noh yes they do\nno theyre not we were in every one of those locations somehow were leaving chron it on footprints behind us\nwhy dont you go with her and see what the lateral sensors turn up ill stay here with data ro\nwell thats interesting your e reading chron it on readings in here but not from me theresa field in this wall why data i came through this wall i walked right through it when i came in here when the phased matter in my body passed through the wall it must ve disrupted the walls molecular structure producing a chron it on field data im right here that sme your e reading watch\ncome on its me you see\ndata stop being so rational try using your imagination once in a while the sea rent just random patterns its me\nhey watch where you point that thing wait a minute data i think you did something here its not so easy to push through anymore the molecules in my hand must have been partially de phased by the anyon beam data if a low level beam can bring my hand part of the way back may be a high level beam can bring me all of the way back ill just have to get you to turn up the beam intensity so that hey wait a minute dont stop now no no no data dont give up on it it works i was just creating more fields your method is fine you just need to turn up the intensity data ro\nis that ro\nro\nanytime\ntheres still no indication that the romulans set up a muon wave in our dilithium chamber ro\nnow what\nno captain wait ro\nyeah well the beam strength would have to be pretty strong in order for us to be visible for more than a millisecond somebodys going to have to be looking directly at usr o\nten forward well thats perfect well create as many chron it on fields in there as we can get them to flood that room with a stronger beam\nits our memorial service ro\nwhy not ro\nyeah its perfect come on lets get started\nhere we go\nworf worf can you see usr o\nwere right here worf damn ro\nyeah i know\nwe ve got to do something now before they go into war pro\ndo it ro\nokay hang on\ndata can you see usr o\nwere right here were right here\ncome on data put it all together now\ndata please be right\ndata do you see us\nlaforge to engineering take the warp engines offline until further notice theresa muon wave build up in the dilithium chamber\nit looks like a great party do you mind if we join you\nthanks data ive never been to a better funeral\ncould you pass the rolls ro\ncome on we didnt eat for almost two days im hungry whats wrong ro\ncome on ro\nmaybe we should develop our own interphase device if it can teach rol are n humility it can do anything

i know of but ill check with the bajoran liaison officer o\npicard to riker\ngood\nwhat is the status of the engine replacement\nvery well\nby all means\npermission granted make whatever arrangements

personnel sir\nwhat can we do to stop the overload\nsurvivors\nwell need to dump the entire engine core do you have an auto eject system\nmister worf you two seal the chamber\nenterprise we need to jettison the entire engine core youll need to extend the shields once it clears the hull\ntime\nstay there eject the chamber on my order\nnow\nenterprise extend shields\nwell were still here\nwell have a complete power survey done within the hour well probably have to supply them with energy for life support and theyll need a new engine core to get home\nriker to enterprise begin power transfer\nriker here power transfer appears stable at this end captain\nengineering is modifying one of our subspace resonators to act as a new engine core it wont do more than warp two but itll get them home\nwhat about a computer core from thirty or forty years ago one the romulans are already familiar with\ncheck with the enterprise see what s available be sure your concern are addressed before we install it\nthere are a lot of what appear to be experimental engine components lying around over the reid say they were testing a new warp drive design and it blew up in their faces\nwe

ship encountered a species who appears to be threatening 19th century earth i investigated and was inadvertently pulled into their temporal vortex when i saw your photograph in the newspaper i assumed you had joined me from the future from the enterprise i knew your species was long lived but i did not realise you had visited earth so long ago\ngood afternoon sir\nand you are\nmister data could it be under another name\ni cant seem to find your name on the guest list sir\nmadam guinan has discovered many personal friends since the newspaper announcement but if your name is not on the guest list theres nothing i can do\nsir unless you leave this house immediately i will send for the police\nsir please you cant go in there\nforgive me madam he just barged right in\nfold\na poker face carved in

for it\nthat sounded like a very intense discussion\nthats why the enterprise has been sent back to earth i didnt realise\nfull circle\ncaptain you didnt have to come all the way down here i would ve been more than happy to come up to you\nits at zar tak aperitif its very very touchy the trick is to change the evaporation point of the main ingredient you want the temperature where the liquid goes to vapour to be a half a degree below the body temperature of the customer that way when the liquid touches the tongue it evaporates and the flavour is carried entirely by the vapour a few molecules off the vapour point crashes and po of its all gone all of it\ni hear your e sending an away team down to the surface are you going\nmaybe its an unusual away mission\nstarfleet captains dont usually accompany away teams\nthis time you have to\nyou just do do you remember the first time we met\ndont be so sure i just mean if you dont go on this mission well never meet\nmy dear mister clemens why do i think your e not one of them\nmy dear mister clemens please do please do\nperhaps a great deal more\nbut if the earth is not alone and there are millions of inhabited planets in the

that a clipper ship\nof course mister data excuse us we have so much to catch up on excuse us how are you\nwhat exactly are you\nah did my father send you here because if he did you must go back and tell him ive not done listening\nsorry\nand\nwell i cant tell you exactly who the aliens were but i have found out a few things the trio lic is ed rockface tells us were probably dealing with a species with micro centrum cell membranes trio lic waves wouldnt harm them it also might mean they re shapeshifters of some kind\ni dont think its anyone weve run into before nothing we found matches up with any known life forms what does matchup is a cellular fossil which might have been a long just for the ride\na microscopic ciliated life form not unlike a thousand other single celled life forms you d find on any planet surface except this particular one is lb one zero fourfour five and lb one zero fourfour five is only known to exist on one place devi dia two in the mar rab sector\nso

that you know that you might not\ni never thought of it that way\nill see you later lets get together for a game of chess or something okay\nyeah they found data shead a mile beneath san francisco

increases exponentially the closer in we go\nnegative commander\ni dont have one yet laforge to enterprise\nto the temporal distortions\nthat explains a few things how much data\nwell whatever or whoever is there were out of phase with it but were only talking by a fraction of a second\na millisecond a year it wouldnt make any difference if what were reading is true then were occupying the same space but in a different time\nmaybe if we were to create a contained subspace force field\nbut to get a point zero zero four variance wed need an incredibly sensitive phase discriminator data i dont think we ve got one that would come close\nlet me give you a hand with that data\nthe subspace field has been established you reset to go data\nokay thats enough data come on back now\nits not going to be easy to reproduce what data did we can create a contained subspace field but wed need an extraordinarily sensitive phase discriminator to get that point zero zero four variance\nit wont be as good as datas\ni dont know i can try its going to take some time though\ni can probably create a large enough subspace field to encompass everyone but adjusting the phase inside the field thats going to be the hard part\nokay counsellor right over there\nsir\nwere ready now captain the subspace field is established\nive modified this tricorder to interface with the subspace generator it should allow me to control the phase discrimination assuming this is going to work at all i need everyone within the field adjusting synchronic distortion point zero zero one point zero zero two point zero zero three point zero zero four\nthe phase displacement might not bring us far enough into their perceptual range\nfrenchman\nall right\nme too\npaleface\nand its been determined that they date

in fact i wrote a book about it it chronicles the tale of a man of our era who fouled the sixth century by introducing newfangled gadgets and weapons all in the name of progress this idea of time travel is not so far fetched as it might seem in fact i have learned that even now there are people from the future right here in san francisco and i have no doubt that their intent is to foul our

not i find no shame in my efforts to uncover your plot\nyes you do keep telling me that what an interesting pair you are wherein switzerland did you say you were from mister data\noh yes thats right now i remember a frenchman with a talent for poker from what i hear you know i was talking to a friend of mine ches whitley he says to say hello and wonders when your e coming back\nno he works at the county assayers office he says you ve been in there a number of times claiming to be a geological engineer and wanting information about mining operations during the 1850s you remember him now\nyes i know and in the hall of records and in the geological society and a little known mineral shop in chinatown you do get around dont you\ni must admit you ve got me mystified this contraption for

way of life\nwell i know what you say that this is a vessel of exploration and that your mission is to discover new worlds\nthats what the spanish said\nand the dutch and the portuguese its what all

i fear i sadly misjudged you as i have misjudged many things\nthen i have the perfect solution for you im the one who should return to the nineteenth century and remain there so your captain can

cavern walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular polarisation in fact if im right this whole cavern has been configured to focus the spacetime distortion just like a lens captain we think we might be onto something the cavern itself seems to be acting as a focusing mechanism im willing to be tits the same at their habitat back on devi dia two\ntruthfully i dont know that we can get

acknowledge\nyes commander\nsir permission to speak frankly\nour priority is to stop the aliens from any more incursions to earth any delay is unacceptable\nthe captain would not i recommend we target photon torpedoes on the alien habitat and destroy it immediately\ncommander i have set the photons to fire in staggered rounds detonating in ten second intervals\nthe sequence will be ready to initiate in one minute\ncommander laforge has completed the reconfiguration of the photon torpedoes\nwe have no way of knowing if mister clemens was successful\naye sir\nyes sir\ntorpedoes away

    "episode 126": "commander if we bridged our transporter system with their s we might be able to cut through the ionic field\nill ask ensign dern to join you\nshouldnt i stay here and set up the remote link\nwhat do you what exactly do you mean by a bumpy ride\naye sir\nim sorry i just cant do this\ntell that to commander laforge and the rest of the away team\nno\nactually this isnt the first time ive been apprehensive every single time that i tried to do it i had a certain feeling i guess you could call it mortal terror\nwhy because my career in starfleet would be over thats why\nive always managed to avoid it somehow you wouldnt believe how many hours that ive logged in shuttlecraft i mean the idea of being deconstructed molecule by molecule its more than i can stand even when i was a child i always had a dreadful fear that if ever i was dematerialised that i would never come back again whole i know it sounds crazy but\nit does how\nplex ing\nplex ing sounds easy enough\nyou know i feel better already i think i can do this\nno no we talked about confronting my fears the best way out is through you said that once remember\nim going to beam over there i can do it\nsure please proceed\ngood good\nyour e afraid of transporting too\nspiders theyve never bothered me\nwhat happened\nthanks\nyes sir\naye sir\nme too sir\nbarclay to enterprise one to be am back\nwe could try to reconstitute the data stream\ncommander has anything strange ever happened to you during transport\ni dont know anything out of the ordinary\ni mean have you ever seen anything\nin the during transport\njust wondering\nwhen i was returning to the enterprise i couldve sworn i saw something in the matter stream\nthere was phased matter all around at first i thought it was some kind of energy discharge but then it flew toward me and it touched my arm how could something be in there molecules flying apart half phased i mean its impossible isnt it\nall right\nyeah\nno chief youve done enough already\nyou know may be ignorance really is bliss\nwell if i didnt know so much about these things maybe they wouldnt scare me so much i can still remember the day in doctor olaf sons transporter theory class when he was talking about the body being converted into billions of kilo quads of data zipping through subspace and i realised theres no margin for error one atom out of place and poof you never come back its amazing people are nt lost all the time\nyes but you realise if these imaging scanners are off even a thousandth of a percent\nive heard of problems what about transporter psychosis\nwater ten degrees celsius computer access starfleet medical database tell me about er describe the disorder transporter psychosis\nno no stop all i need is what causes it\nwhat are the symptoms\nhallucinations what kind of hallucinations\ncomputer what is the treatment for transporter psychosis\naye sir\nimf in eyes thank you\nyes sir\nim just fine sir\ni do\ni think ill do that sir thank you\nim walking\nnowhere i just dont get to these decks very often look theres stellar cartography i thought that was deck eleven\ni was i was having trouble sleeping and im trying to wear myself out it is a perfectly normal thing to be doing isnt it\nim always nervous everybody knows that\nwell i was wrong they checked the transporter and there was n time an there was nothing there i imagined the whole thing\nlisten counsellor i really appreciate your concern in this matter but i really wish you wouldnt continue this conversation im really perfectly fine\nim not endangering anyone else and i wish you would\nfine fine do what you have to do counsellor\ncomputer more bird send stress reduction programme water\ni dont care just give me water\ncalm calm stay calm all right computer lets try some music something soothing\nno chief ive just ive been reviewing the transport logs what are these energy variations that keep appearing there was one when i transported to the science ship you see\na fluctuation occurred while i was inside the matter stream\ni need you to transport me to the sciences hip and then directly back again and while im in the beam can you recreate one of those ionic fluctuations\ni need commander laforge wants some tricorder readings on those fluctuations\nnoi the transporter sensors may not be sensitive enough im giving you an order mister obrien\neither theres something in there or im going crazy and ive just got to know you can understand that cant you\ni want you to wake the senior staff\nthen i saw it again just twenty minutes ago it was the same exact thing just moving around in the transporter beam\nit was dark and distorted and it had what looked like a mouth\nwell i thought i was hallucinating that i had that it was transporter psychosis but now i know what is a win there was real i was the only one who experienced ionic fluctuations in the transport may be thats why no one else saw it\ni know what you re going to say captain i know ive been acting strange lately but you ve got to believe me i would never have called you in here unless i was absolutely certain\nso something did happen to me in the transporter beam\nsir commander laforge and i were planning to recreate the circumstances of the explosion on the yosemite that might give us some answers permission to continue with the experiment\naye sir\nyes doctor\naye sir\nthe field is at its maximum limit but it is holding\nlife forms\nwhich caused a plasma explosion similar to the one on the science ship\nbut what i saw was much bigger than a microbe\ninside me\nsuspend me i dont like the sound of this\nhow long\nbut if im in the matter stream too long\nright\nenergise\nthere are more crew members in the beam you have to grab them and hold on\nwell when i saw there was more than one of them i thought maybe the other crew was trying the same thing that we were\nthe residual energy from the plasma streamer it must ve amplified the charge in the buffer enough to keep your patterns from degrading captains log stardate 460436 there programmed biofilter was effective in removing the alien microbes from mister barclay and the four crewmembers the microbes have been returned to the plasma streamer\nchief\nwell to be honest i always avoided you\nbecause you run the transporters and i hate the transporters at least i used to so whats in the box\nits your pet spider\nshes very large\nsure\ner chief back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc copyright 1966 present the star

nine by researchers on del in ia two\nit is caused by a breakdown of neurochemical molecules during transport affecting the body s motor functions autonomic systems and the brains higher reasoning centres\nvictims suffer from paranoid delusions multi infarct dementia hallucinations\nvictims experience somatic tactile and visual hallucinations accompanied by psychogenic hysteria peripheral symptoms include sleeplessness accelerated heart rate diminished eyesight leading to acute myopia painful spasms in the extremities and in most cases dehydration\nthere is no known treatment\nspecify temperature\nwere infected with something lieutenant kelly tried to reprogram the biofilter\nim ready\ncommander riker could you come here please\nlieutenant joshua kelly he was the ships engineer\nhe has second and third degree burns over most of his body but i dont think they were the cause of his death im like to take him back to do an autopsy\nid like to take a closer look at those burns take a tissue sample please\ndamage to the epidermis only initiate a circulatory probe\nhis hearts beating cardio stimulator now its gone\nnow the respiratory systems active what the hell is going on\nthe autopsy showed residual ionisation in every one of lieutenant kellys systems i think thats what caused the muscular and systemic contractions\ntheres evidence of electrical burns on the victims body as if he was exposed to ionised gas or high energy plasma\ni dont see anything wrong with his arm\nill run a micro cellular scan of mister barclays arm it might take some time but if theres a problem ill find it\nim reading minute levels of residual ionisation in the subdermal tissue of his left arm the patterns correspond exactly to those we measured in lieutenant kellys body and in the sample container from the science ship theres no question you have been exposed to the same high energy plasma they were\nyou might ve been exposed to something from the science ship you did say something touched your left arm during transport and thats exactly where the ionisation is focused\nit might ill have to run a base pair correlation to see if there s any sign of breakdown\nid like you to wear this monitoring device it will tell me if theres the slightest sign of increased ionisation\nsome of these microbes are also in your body reg\nthey were in lieutenant kellys body as well thats what caused the contractions during the autopsy\nthe imaging scanners still havent isolated the microbes\nthe imaging scanners are actuating\ndrop the force field\nour scanners can not penetrate the plasma streamers distortion field\nno sir ionic interference is too heavy\nbridge to captain picard\nthe away team is returning to the enterprise sir\naye sir\nthe analysis of the fragments is not yet complete\nthe container does show evidence of residual ionisation i believe your hypothesis was correct it was used to store high energy plasma\nperhaps we should attempt to recreate their experiment to see what happens when matter is beamed aboard under similar conditions\nare you all right lieutenant\ngeordi lieutenant barclay appears inordinately preoccupied with his physiological condition i have seen him check his pulse rate as well as his visual acuity several times over the last twenty minutes\nstructural reinforcement is at two hundred forty percent\na standard analysis begins with a resonance frequency scan\ninitiating resonance sweep frequency range at three\nthat is correct they appear to be quasi energy microbes that exist within the distortion field of the plasma streamer\nnormal spatial relationships are often distorted within the matter stream your perceptions may have been exaggerated\nthe microbes exist simultaneously as both matter and energy the biofilter can not distinguish them from the matter stream\nthe molecules would begin to emit nucleon icp articles we may be able to derive a pattern the computer would recognise\nyour pattern would degrade to the point where your signal would be permanently lost\nsir commander laforge and i were planning to recreate the circumstances of the explosion on the yosemite that might give us some answers permission to continue with the experiment\nthe ferengi are claiming two of their freighters were destroyed by a cardassian warship in your sector\nalthough im loathe to believe the ferengi about anything there was evidence of cardassian weapons if the cardassians also attacked the yosemite it could indicate a large scale movement into this sector\nhow soon until you know\nvery well\nwe can be am them over there captain but with all this interference we might not get a positive lock to bring them back\nthats a good idea barclay captain i think we can do it were going to bridge the two transporter systems\naye sir barclay im going to need a systems engineer on this away team\ni meant you barclay\ndern can do that come on lets go\nreg your e up reg\nmaybe they abandoned ship\nthere was an explosion that much we do know\nive ruled out a reactor core failure and theres no sign of a systems overload\nhow is that possible the transporter is still functioning\nreg welcome aboard you ready to work\ngood why dont you start by downloading the ships science logs over there\ni dont know how these fit in but i found them all around the transporter platform\nthey look like pieces of a standard sample container\nlaforge to transporter room three im ready to go\nmission logs science logs medical logs theyre all scrambled looks like the blast wiped out the ship score memory\nits worth a try\nlike what\nno not really this looks hopeless were not going to get anything out of these logs you know maybe this broken sample container i found can tell us something lets try to get this thing back into one piece\nwhere\nsometimes my visor picks up resonance patterns from the matter energy conversion its actually kind of pretty why\nreg what are you getting at did you saw something during transport\nsomething\nwed better check it out when were done here well run a full diagnostic on the transporter all right\nthe pattern buffer is fine\nreg theres a lot of energy floating around in the beam maybe you saw a surge in the matter stream\nreg how many transporter accidents have there been in the last ten years two three there are millions of people who transport safely every day without a problem\nreg transporting really is the safest way to travel\nplasma theres no way they could ve been exposed unless it was matter from the streamer\nno data whats the report on that broken sample container\ncaptain if there s evidence of similar ionisation in those fragments it could mean they tried to be am aboard material from the streamer\naye sir\nfrom the looks of these fracture patterns id say that the explosive force came from within the container\nso they were collecting samples from the plasma streamer they had the proper container how could it have exploded\nthats a good idea well prepare a new container reg i dont want to take any chance she restart setting up a level five containment field herein engineering okay\nthanks data\nreg\nyou okay\nyou look a little pale\nlook reg its been a long couple of days why dont you get some rest we ve got everything under control here\nlaforge to counsellor troi\ncounsellor do you have a minute\nactivating containment field well that should do it okay reg weve locked onto the coordinates of the plasma streamer go ahead and beam aboard a sample will you\nokay what would they have done first\nthat sounds like a good place to start lets get it done\nbarclay check the containment field\nmy visors picking up biomagnetic energy highly complex patterns you know i think these things are alive reg\nre greg\nwe didnt detect them until we tried to run the resonance frequency scan apparently they didnt like it very much they shattered the sample container\nexactly when we linked up with their transporter system one or more of the microbes must have got into our system we think they re still caught in the buffer it might explain what you saw\nthe biofilter should have screened them out but it didnt\nright but if we held barclay suspended in mid transport at the point where matter starts to lose molecular cohesion\nand then reprogram the biofilters to screen the microbes out i think this ll work reg\nwed have to hold you in there for awhile\nthirty forty seconds its tough to tell but i think it d be safe\nready reg\nstarting biofilters can\nhis signal resolutions dropped to fifty five percent\ni know i know just give me one more second we need more dispersion increase phase transition frequency\ngot it pattern acquisition positive\ndont worry reg this wont hurt a bit\ntheres something in the beam with him security to transporter room three\nreg what happened\nit looks like he pushed molecular dispersion past the integrity point your patterns got caught in the beam\nill have to send you over one at a time commander because of bandwidth limitations and the transport cycle will take a little longer\nfour five seconds about twice the normal time im afraid you rein for a bumpy ride commander\nthere may be a small amount of static charge accumulation youll feel a bit of tingling its nothing to worry about\nengaging system interlock pattern buffers synchronised phase transition coils at standby energising hes there\nengaging interlock buffers synched energising\nengaging interlock buffers synched oh wait a minute im reading anionic fluctuation in the matter stream oh no problem okay energising\nengaging interlock buffers in synch phase coils\nyour e sure about this sir\nitll only take a minute it should be a smooth ride over\ni know how you feel about this sir\nno arachnids sickening crawly little things dont you think all those legs\na few years back i was called into reroute an emitter array at a starbase on z ayr a four turns out the entire system was infested with talaria n hook spiders you ever seen at a larian hook spider their legs are half a metre longwell i had a choice doi walk away and let the emitter blow itself to hell or do i crawl in the jeffries tube with twenty hook spiders\nit was the hardest thing i ever did but i got through it after that i was never quite as afraid of spiders\nenergising\nstandby commander\nstandby sir\nyou see sir that wasnt so bad was it\nthe confinement beam subsystems checkout so do the phase transition coils\nemitter pads targeting scanners theyre all working fine this systems clean so is the science vessels\nill run as canon the heisenberg compensators\nits no problem why dont you give me a hand\nsir\nwith all due respect sir ive been doing this for twenty two

fifty years not since they perfected the multiplex pattern buffers\nsir begging your pardon but couldnt this wait til the morning\ntheyre just ionic fluctuations sir a result of our interlock with the yosemite s transporter system\nits nothing to worry about sir\ni guess so but if you dont mind my asking sir what for\nwe can do that from right here\naye sir if you dont mind my making an observation

them back to the ship analyze them there mister barclay glad you could join us\nfrom where did the ionisation come\nlet me get this straight you think this thing was alive\ndoes this ionisation pose a threat to mister barclay\ngranted tell mister obrien to take all the primary transporters offline i dont want to risk any further contaminations make sure you take all the necessary safety precautions\nreg you were faced with a difficult transport anyone would have been apprehensive in that situation\nim sure they understand as soon as you feel up to it you can probably still join them\nregis there something your e not telling me\nwhy have you kept it a secret\ni doubt that\nits not crazy about it you are being taken a part molecule by molecule reg your e not the first person to have anxiety about transporting we can de sensitise you to this type of fear its a slow and gradual process but it works\nwell you might first try a relaxation technique like plex ing\nyes its a beta zoid method the next time you feel nervous about transporting you stimulate a neural pressure point like this\ntheresa nerve cluster just behind the carotid artery it stimulates the part of the brain that releases natural endorphins\nhere there\ntheres no need to rush\ni suppose i did\ngo ahead commander\nlieutenant barclay ive been calling you why havent you responded reg what are you doing\ni can see that where are you going\nmister barclay\ncommander laforge said you seemed a little nervous this morning\nhe also mentioned that you said you saw something in the transporter beam\nyou dont sound very convinced of that\nmister barclay your e exhausted and highly agitated and i can not allow a member of this crew to endanger himself and others i think\ni think it would be in your best interest to take a leave of absence reg im temporarily relieving you of duty\nreg why did you wait so long to tell anybody about your arm\nmagnify\nno response\nunlikely the escape pods

between the log and the tricorder readings i took just three days later the tricorder shows massive physiological deterioration compared with her condition when she beamed aboard i find it hard to

death poses some kind of threat to the enterprise\nthen we have no alternative but to concur with his wishes\nbut i was under the impression there was a ceasefire agreement\nambassador the situation sounds so volatile perhaps a cooling off period\nthen i would recommend that we ask both sides if they would agree to meet in the city of dar then\nits a coastal city that has been neutral throughout the conflict both ser on ians andre kag loyalists live there it might be acceptable as a compromise\nambassador i came to alert you that there kag sand these ron ians are in disagreement about the seating arrangements at the conference table\nthe good news however is that the ceasefire seems to be holding\nchief\ndeanna\nsecurity to transporter room two\nits nothing its superficial what happened to deanna\nno you should proceed with your mission\nchief transport them to the planet surface\nits a little stiff but it ll be fine\ncould deanna have picked up some kind of disease from her\npicard to lieutenant worf\nmister worf contact ambassador al kari need to speak with him\nproceed with the autopsy medical log stardate 460751i have performed an autopsy on alka rs mother but instead of answering our questions the results have created an even deeper mystery\nbut how could that be we both saw the woman\npicard to lieutenant worf\nmeet me in transporter room two were going down to the surface\nand she was nt ninety three years old\nyes for a very good reason counsellor deanna troi is in sickbay dying doctor crusher doesnt know the cause of her condition but i believe you do\nalka ral kar\nis this what youve done to counsellor troi\nso then you deliberately used deanna\nreceptacles\nyou can not explain away a want only immoral act because you think it is connected to some higher purpose\nthat does not justify brutal ising her nor any of the others you have used\ndo you think that makes you appear courageous because your e mistaken your e a coward al kar you exploit the innocent because your e unwilling to shoulder the burdens of unpleasant emotions well this time you will be held accountable im taking you back to the enterprise to release counsellor troi\nmister worf\nlock on to alka rs signal bring him on board\nthen work with mister laforge to find a way to break through it i want that man on this ship\nill be in sickbay\nhe has no intention of stopping he feels perfectly justified in using her until she dies\nif deanna dies and he breaks the link with her then he will choose someone else possibly someone from his own delegation\nwe must bear in mind that well be putting his next victim at risk i want every possible security measure taken to protect that person\nproceed doctor\nenterprise to ambassador al kar respond sir\nambassador you must return to the enterprise immediately counsellor troi is dying\nwe are prepared to transport you from the surface whether you come willingly or not\nthey wont protect you any longer\ntransporter room two prepare to energise\ni intend to make certain that you answer for what you have done\npicard to transporter room two lock on to the young woman in ambassador al kars quarters we may have to transport her out of there\nmister worf i want you to station yourself outside her quarters\npicard to transporter room three\npicard to transporter room three energise\nred alert shields up\nthey dont want to take on the enterprise\ncancel red alert mister worf take the weapons offline\nyes sir\naye sir\nhi its that time again the dreaded crew evaluation reports\nits not going to be any easier tomorrow\nwhats wrong\ni know shes been sick shes very old shes probably senile who knows we could all end up that way someday\nfirst molecular biology lieutenant jeffrey frat is\ngo ahead\nwere on our way\nim sorry ambassador\nwe were supposed to finish the crew evaluation reports\nas you were\nof course not\ni know that i believe we were with lieutenant frat is in molecular biology\ni dont know could we just continue with the evaluation\ndeanna im sorry i intruded when your e ready to work why dont you give me a call\nambassador weve received word from these roni an and there kag delegates theyve agreed to meet with you in dar then tomorrow\nambassador the counsellor andi are needed on the bridge\ni dont know what you thought you were doing in there but you were way out of line\ndeck nine\nall right deanna just what the hell is all this\nof course i care about you im worried about you whats all this\nthis just isnt you\ndeanna\nwhat is this\nyou wouldnt have recognised her her dress her hair everything about her im closer to deanna than ive ever been to anyone but last night she was someone that i had never seen before\nno ive thought and thought about it i dont have an answer\nisnt there something you can do to counteract it\nwait a minute your e talking about killing deanna\nhow will you\nhow much longer do we have\nbeverly think salk ar must have been at a susceptible point in the meditation ceremony he was vulnerable\nthat sour guess like a man with no immune system he was nt able to handle the overload\nshe seems to be fine

    "episode 128": "aye sir\ncan i help you sir\nsir this area is restricted to authorised personnel\nwe can restart the engines in ten minutes commander\naye sir\naye sir\nplease enter programme\nin sufficient data please specify parameters\nthere have been five federation ships with that name please specify by registry number\nprogramme complete enter when ready\nyou have a hairline fracture of the humorous it will ache for a few days but it should be fine\nother than a couple of bumps and bruises id say you feel fine for a man of a hundred and forty seven\ncaptain the first thing you need to get is some rest now this has been a shock to your system and i want you to not push yourself\nill have someone show you your quarters\nbye be well\ncaptain i have identified the signal it is from the uss jen olena federation transport ship reported missing in this sector seventy five years ago\nthere are no stars or other stellar bodies listed on our navigational charts however sensors indicate the presence of an extremely strong gravitational source in this vicinity\ni am having difficulty scanning the object it appears to be approximately two hundred million kilometres in diameter\nthe objects enormous mass is causing a great deal of gravimetric interference that might have prevented our sensors from detecting it before we dropped out of warp\nthe object does fit the general parameters of dyson s theory\npossibly a great number of people commander the interior surface area of a sphere this size is the equivalent of more than two hundred and fifty million class m planets\ni have located the jeno lens iritis impacted on the surface of the sphere\nthere are no life signs however there are several small power emanations and life support is still functioning on minimal levels\nsensor readings indicate the presence of ag typestar at the centre of the sphere there also appears to be a class m atmosphere clinging to the interior surface\nnot as yet sir our preliminary data suggests it is still capable of supporting life we have been unable to find definite signs of current habitation\naye sir\ni believe i maybe of some assistance captain scott is unaware of the existence of syn the hol\nyes sir it is an alcohol substitute now being served aboard starships it simulates the appearance taste and smell of alcohol but the intoxicating affects can be easily dismissed\nno siri a man android lieutenant commander data\ni believe guinan does keep a limited supply of non syn the holic products perhaps one of them would be to your liking\nit is it is it is green\ncommander i believe i have found something on the sphere which could be a communications device there san antenna array approximately four hundred thousand kilometres south of our present position it is emitting low intensity subspace signals\nno sir not from our present orbit the array is currently directed away from us\nsensors indicate that the largecircle is a portal or airlock possibly leading to the interior of the sphere\nsome type of tractor beam has locked on to us\nthe resonance frequency of the tractor beams is incompatible with our power systems warp and impulse engine relays have been overloaded i am attempting to compensate\napproximately ninety million kilometres from the stars photosphere i am reading a great deal of surface instability it may be\nwe will enter the suns photosphere in three minutes\nour flight path is changing right ten points even degrees sir insufficient to clear the photosphere\naye sir\nthe sphere appears to be abandoned sensors show that the star is extremely unstable it is experiencing severe bursts of radiation and matter expulsions\ni believe we triggered a series of automatic piloting beams designed to guide ships in to the sphere\nit is a solar flare captain magnitude twelve class b\nthe star has entered a period of increased activity sensors indicate that the solar flares will continue to grow in three hours our shields will no longer be sufficient to protect us sir\nthe interior surface area is over ten to the sixteenth square kilometres it will take seven hours to completely scan the surface\ni will endeavour to speed up the process sir\nwith impulse engines operating at sixty percent power it will take one minute and forty seconds\nwe are within transporter range\nmister scott\nah\nthis is the food replicator and your computer terminal\nthese are standard guest quarters siri can try and find something bigger if you want\nthe holodeck sten forward and the gymnasium are all at your disposal the computer can tell you how to find them until we issue you a com badge just use one of these panels if you need anything\nexcuse me sir but i have to return to duty\nlife support is barely operating\ncommander the transporter is still online its being fed power from the auxiliary systems\nthats not all the phase inducers are connected to the emitter array the override is completely gone and the pattern buffers been locked into a continuous diagnostic cycle\ntheresa pattern in the buffer still\ni dont know ive never seen a transporter jury rigged like this\ni know a way to find out\nsomeone elses pattern is still in the buffer\nnot to worry commander ill take care of him sir\nthose were replaced with iso linear chips about forty years ago its a lot more efficient now that san power tap\nso you were saying earlier that you were on your way to the nor pin colony when you had a warp engine failure\nyeah it is you were saying its big as life you mean the dyson sphere\nyeah its pretty amazing so what happened when you first approach edit\ncan i ask you a question what in the world made you think of using the transporter pattern buffer to survive\nyeah but locking it into a diagnostic cycle so that the pattern wouldnt degrade and then cross connecting it phase inducers to provide a regenerative power source thats absolutely brilliant\ni think your e going to enjoy the twenty fourth century mister scott weve made some pretty incredible advances these last eighty years\nwait until you see the holodeck\nill get right on it sir\ni need to get down to engineering and begin that analysis\nwere pretty busy down there anyway captain scott i promise id be happy to give you at our just as soon as the doctor says its okay\ni want you to shut down the warp engines and recalibrate the aft sensors while i work on the lateral array\nbartel its okay ill handle it captain scott this really isnt\nscotty this really isnt a good time for a tour were running a phase seven survey of the dyson sphere\nthats very kind but im sure we can handle it\nyour e right wed be grateful for any help you can give us\nadjust the frequency stabilisation on the main deflector dish its out of synch with the aft sensors\nwhat\nwe use a multiphase auto containment field now its meant to operate above three percent\nthank you lieutenant\nthank you\nwere composite the crystals while they re still inside the articulation frame look mister scott id love to explain everything to you but the captain wants this spectrographic analysis done by thirteen hundred hours\nyeah well i told the captain id have this analysis done in an hour\nan hour\nof course i did\ncaptain scott ive tried to be patient ive tried to be polite but ive got a job to do here and quite frankly youre in the way\nwe did try to download their memory core but it was pretty heavily damaged in the crash we actually havent been able to get much out of it\nits possible he does know those systems better than any of us ill have lieutenant bartel beam down with him\nme sir\nill go with him sir\nare you feeling all right\nokay energise\nokay ive got three access lines to the central core still nothing\nhuh\ni dont know it seems like some of its held together pretty well\nwell you know that s interesting because i was just thinking that a lot of these systems havent changed much in the last seventy five years this transporter is basically the same system we use on the enterprise subspace radio and sensors still operate under the same basic principle impulse engine design hasnt changed much in the last two hundred years if it wasnt for all the structural damage this ship might still be in service today\ni dont know if this ship were operational i bet shed run circles around the enterprise at impulse speeds just because something sold doesnt mean you throw it away\ni havent seen anything like that in a long time but i bet i might be able to come up with something similar laforge to enterprise laforge to enterprise come in please\nno theyre gone\ni cant find them anywhere in orbit\nno wed be picking up background radiation if they d gone down\nmay be whatever happened we ve got to find them if we can get these engines back online we could track them with their impulse ion trail\nthe tank cant withstand that kind of pressure\nwhat do you mean where did i get that idea its in the impulse engine specifications\nyeah\nokay\nhey you were right the auxiliary tank is holding\noh no your e the senior officer here\nall right\nit looks like some kind of doorway\nno be there the question is how\nso they didnt go in willingly this looks like some kind of communications array\ndid you try hailing them\nhailing is standard procedure today too scotty what if those arent communications arrays what if they re access terminals which are triggered by subspace signals on certain frequencies\nexactly the enterprise when they saw that terminal they probably did the same thing you did seventy five years ago opened a channel only this time they triggered something that activated that hatch and pulled the ship inside the sphere\nyeah we could probably trigger the hatch ourselves only wed get pulled in like they were\nyou cant be serious that hatch is huge it llc rush this ship like an egg\nscotty its crazy\nall right lets do it\nwere at five hundred thousand kilometres\nokay here we go\ncome on the res nothing out here give it up\nthats it lets go full impulse\nlaforge to enterprise do you readme\nwere using the je nolen to hold open the hatch that you came through but our shields arent going to hold out much longer\nive lost helm control laforge to enterprise captain were not going to be able to move this ship out of the way when you get here\nyour e going to have to destroy it in order to escape\nso this alien spacebaby which was about the size of a four story building really thought the enterprise was its mother\nno really it was suckling power directly from the ships fusion reactors so doctor brahms and i changed the power frequency from twenty one centimetres to point oh two centimetres\nthats right\nactually i had a better idea\nshes a little slow but shell certainly get you to the nor pin colony if thats really where you want to go\nyeah they are\nyou take care of yourself out there\nprogramme complete enter when ready\ntake us out of warp ensign all stop\nreport\ncan you localise the source of the gravitational field\nwhy didnt we detect this before now\nmister data could this be a dyson sphere\nits a very old theory number one im not surprised that you havent heard of it in the twentieth century a physicist called freeman dyson postulated the theory that an enormous hollow sphere could be constructed around a star this would have the advantage of harnessing all the radiant energy of that star a population living on the interior surface would have virtually inexhaustible sources of power\nensign rager put us into synchronous orbit above that position\nmagnify\nim jean luc picard welcome aboard the enterprise captain scott\nhow are you feeling\ni must say i was little surprised when commander riker told me that you were aboard the je nolen our records didnt show you listed as a member of the crew\ni see well i would very much enjoy the opportunity to hear you talk about your career im sure you would have some fascinating insights into the events of your time\ngood well i look forward to it excuse me commander we need to begin a full spectrographic analysis of the dyson sphere\ngood once again welcome onboard captain\nis there any indication that the sphere is inhabited\nmister data send out a series of class four probes to survey the far side of the sphere perhaps well have more luck with them\ni hope im not interrupting i was just coming off duty and i wanted to see how you were doing\nthank you\naldebaran whiskey who do you think gave it to guinan\nconstitution class\ntheres one in the fleet museum but then of course this is your enterprise\nthe first ship i ever served aboard as captain was called the stargazer it was an overworked underpowered vessel always on the verge of flying apart at the seams in every measurable sense my enterprise is far superior but there are times when i would give almost anything to command the stargazer again\nwhat do you think of the enterprise d\nbut\nseventy five years is a long time if you would care to study some technical schematics or\ncome\nmister laforge i understand that before the je nolen crashed it had conducted an extensive survey of the dyson sphere have we been able to access any of those records\nperhaps captain scott could be of use in accessing that material\nmister laforge i would like you to accompany captain scott\nyes look this is not an order its a request and its one which you must feel perfectly free to decline you see one of the most important things in a persons life is to feel useful now mister scott is a starfleet officer and i would like him to feel useful again\nthank you\nmister worf open a channel to that communications array\nfull sensor sweep mister data where are we\nmanoeuvring thrusters\nno but it may be enough to turn us into orbit hold our distance from the photosphere ensign port thrusters ahead full starboard thrusters back full\nvery well mister data begin a scan of the interior surface for life forms i want to know who brought us in here and why\nthen that would explain why they abandoned it but if theres no one still living there how were we brought inside\nshields\nmister worf can we use the phasers to open a hole in the sphere\nmister data we have to find some way out of here begin scanning for another hatch or portal that might still be open\ngo ahead commander we read you\nunderstood ensign set a course\nhow much longer before we reach them\nbridge to transporter room three prepare to be am two from the je nolen as soon as were within range\nbridge to transporter room energise\nfire torpedoes\nwell call it an extended loan since you lost your ship saving ours it seemed only fair\nwell bon voyage mister scott\naye sir\naye sir\nweve lost main power auxiliary power down to twenty percent\nauxiliary power failing\nthe tractor beams have released us sir\nsir the inertial motion from the tractor beams is still carrying us forward impulse engines are offline and i cant stop our momentum were falling directly into the star\nwere in orbit captain our altitude is one hundred fifty thousand kilometres\ncode one alpha zero ship in distress\nsensors\nthats nearly as large as the earths orbit around the sun\na dyson sphere\nare you saying you think there are people living in there\nriker to engineering geordi join us in transporter room three mister worf\nthis airs pretty stale\nsee if you can increase the oxygen level\nthere materialisation subroutine has been disabled\nthis doesnt make any sense locking the unit in a diagnostic mode just sends the matter array through the pattern buffer why would anyone want to\nits completely intact theres less than point zero zero three percent signal degradation how is that possible\ncould someone survive inside a transporter buffer for seventy five years\nim sorry\nim commander william riker starship enterprise lieutenant commander geordi laforge\nwell\ncaptain scott lieutenant worf\ncaptain perhaps there are a few things we should talk about\nwe should probably get you to sickbay doctor crusher will want to\ngeordi i think our guest is going to have a lot of engineering questions\ncan you open a channel\nensign prepare to put us in orbit above those coordinates captain picard to the bridge please\nthis looks like the front door should we ring the bell\nhelm get us out of here\nhold position here until we can get our bearings\nive got thirty percent power it wont be enough to stop us\nlieutenant bartel divert all power from auxiliary relay systems to the manoeuvring thrusters\nill see about getting main power back online\nshes not much to look at\nscotty\nthank you lad we ve got to get franklin out of there\naye lad franklin we went in together some things wrong one of the inducers has failed boost the gain on the matter stream come on franklin i know your e still in the reits no use his patterns degraded fifty three percent hes gone\nso ami he was a goodlad\nthe enterprise i should have known i bet jim kirk himself hauled the old girl out of mothballs to come looking for me captain montgomery scott tell me how long have i been missing\nlieutenant\nyouve changed the resonator array\nwhat have you done with the duo tronic enhancers\nah\naye thats right we had an overload in one of the plasma transfer conduits the captain brought us out of warp and we hit some gravimetric interference and then there it was as big as life is that a conduit interface\naye an actual dyson sphere can you imagine the engineering skills needed to even design such a structure\nwell we began a standard survey of the surface and we were just completing the initial orbitals can when our aft power coils suddenly exploded the ship got caught in the spheres gravity well and down we went franklin and i were the only ones to survive the crash\nwell we didnt have enough supplies to wait for a rescue so we had to think of something\ni think it was only fifty percent brilliant franklin deserved better\nfrom what ive seen you ve got a fine ship mister laforge a real beauty here i must admit to being a bit overwhelmed\nthank you well ill say this about your enterprise the doctors are a fair sight prettier\nthank you sir and call me scotty\ni dont know how ami feeling\ni dont feel a day over a hundred and twenty\nwell i was never actually a member of the crew i was just a passenger i was heading for nor pin five to settle down and enjoy my retirement\nid be happy to\nsir\nengineering i thought you d never ask\naye\ngood lord man where have you put me\nbigger in my day even an admiral wouldnt have had such quarters on a starship you know i remember a time we had to transport the d ohlman of ela as you never heard anyone whine and complain so much about quarters as she did\nyou know these quarters remind me of a hotel room on arg eli us oh now there is a planet everything a man wants right at his finger tips of course on the first visit i got into a wee bit of trouble\noh well then thank you\noh i dont think so lassie but ill let you know if you can\nwere in engineering call me scotty\nim not here for a tour laddie im here to help\ni was a starfleet engineer for fifty two years mister laforge i think im still useful\ngood lets get to work\nladdie you need to phase lock the warp fields within three percent or theyll become unstable\nwell look here the warp field is\noh well that would make the difference\ni remember a time when the old enterprise was spiralling in toward psi two thousand\nthe captain wanted to try a cold start of the warp engines i told him that without a proper phase lock it would take at least thirty minutes you can na change the laws of physics i told him but he wouldnt believe me so i had to come up with a new engine startup routine do you know that your dilithium crystals are going to fracture\ndo you mind a little advice starfleet captains are like children they want everything right now and they want it their way but the secret is to give them only what they need not what they want\nhow long will it really take\nyou didnt tell him how long it would really take did you\noh laddie you ve got a lot to learn if you want people to think of you as a miracle worker now listen\ni was driving starships while your great grandfather was still in diapers id think you d be a little grateful for a some help ill leave ye to work mister laforge\naye lad scotch neat\nthank you\nwhat in blazes is this\nladdie i was drinking scotch a hundred years before you were born and i can tell you that whatever this is it is definitely not scotch\nsyn the hol\nyour e not quite human are you\nsynthetic scotch synthetic commanders\nwhat is it\nah\nthe android at the bar said you could show me my old ship let me see it\nthe enterprise show me the bridge of the enterprise you chattering piece of\none seven oh one no bloody ab cord\nheres to you lads\nnot at all not at all have a drink with me captain\ni dont know what it is exactly but i would be real careful its real\nah\naye your e familiar with them\ni actually served on two this was the first she was also the first ship i ever served on as chief engineer you know i served aboard eleven ships freighters cruisers starships but this is the only one i think of the only one i miss\nits like the first time you fall in love you dont ever love a woman quite like that again well to the enterprise and the stargazer old girlfriends well never meet again\nshe sa beauty with a good crew\nbut when i was here i could tell you the speed that we were traveling by the feel of the deck plates but on your ship i feel like im just in the way\nim not eighteen i cant start out like a raw cadet not here comes a time when a man finds that he cant fall in love again he knows that its time to stop i dont belong on your ship i belong on this one this was my home this is where i had a purpose but its not real its just a computer generated fantasy and im just an old man who s trying to hide in it computer shut this bloody thing off its time i acted my age\nnever get drunk unless your e willing to pay for it the next day ill manage\nthe primary computer database should be online now give it a try\nbunch of old useless garbage\ni say it sold mister laforge it cant handle the interface of your power converter this equipment was designed for a different era now its just a piece of junk\na century out of date its just obsolete\nmay be so but when they can build ships like your enterprise who d want to pilot an old bucket like this\nwe used to have something called a dynamic mode converter you wouldnt have something like that on your enterprise would you\ninterference\nthey could ve crashed into the sphere like the je nolen\ntheres another possibility they could be inside the sphere\nare ye daft the main drive assembly s shot the inducers are melted and the power couplings are wrecked wed need a week just to get started but we dont have a week so theres no sense in crying about it come on well see what we can do with your power converter\nshunt the deuterium from the main cryo pump to the auxiliary tank\nwhere d you get that idea\nregulation forty two slash fifteen pressure variances on irc tank storage\nforget it i wrote it a good engineer is always a wee bit conservative at least on paper just bypass the secondary cut off valve and boost the flow itll work\nif weve done our jobs properly the engines should be coming back online about now\ntake the bridge commander\ni maybe captain by rank but i never wanted to be anything else but an engineer\nthe enterprise ion trail leads right to this point\nill bet you two bottles of scotch that they re inside the sphere and that they went in right through that hatch\nlook at the momentum distribution of the ions it would take an impulse engine at full reverse to put out a signature like that\naye we found hundreds of them when we did our initial survey seventy five years ago\naye that was standard procedure at the time we did it right before we crashed\nfrequencies like our standard ships hail\nvery nice piece of reasoning laddie nice indeed\nmay be all we need to do is to get our foot in the door we might not be pulled inside when the hatch opens if we keep our distance from the sphere say half million kilometres then when the hatch starts to close we move in and we use the je nolen to jam the hatch open hoping that the enterprise will escape\ngeordi the shields will hold dont worry about that i can get a few extra gigawatts out of these babies\ngeordi i have spent my whole life trying to figure out crazy ways of doing things im telling you as one engineer to another i can do this\nengines are ready\nthe plasma

bad dreams\nthis could be the result of lack of sleep\ndrink this before going to bed\na recipe for a warm milk toddy\nthe heat activates amino acids in the lactose making it a natural sedative besides this is a recipe of the captains aunt adelle its delicious\nand listen if it still bothers you tomorrow come and see me and ill run further tests\nthis is curious theres a slight bacterial infection around your neural inputs it was probably interrupting the data stream\nit doesnt match any bacterial strains on record im going to have to sterilise the area but i need to run a resonance tissues can to search for any signs of additional infection come over here sit down now come forward now youre going to need to hold very still\nhere it is again something has caused high levels of serotonin to be produced in geordi s visual cortex when i examined him earlier today i thought it was the result of a bacterial infection but now im finding the same thing in all three they all have elevated levels of serotonin its concentrated in the hippocampus which suggests that they ve been exposed to an euro sedative and thats not all i have detected minute te tryon particle traces in their subdermal tissues\nmy god\nit looks as though your arm has been severed and then reattached\nthe skeletal structure in your radius and ulna is offset by point zero two microns your arm has been

sedative for about twelve hours\nits going to have to be i cant risk giving you a higher dosage\nthe modification would increase our sensor efficiency and imaging resolution by twenty five percent or more\ncommander i would like to remind you about my poetry reading this afternoon\nthen we sat on the sand for some time and observed how the oceans that cover the world were perturbed by the tides from the orbiting moon overhead how relaxing the sound of the waves is you said i began to expound upon tidal effects when you asked me to stop looking somewhat perplexed so i did not explain why the sunset turns red and we watched the occurrence in silence instead\nthat poem was written in a napa estic tetra meter for my ninth poem\nthroughout the ages from keats to j or kemo poets have composed odes to individuals who have had a profound effect on their lives in keeping with that tradition i have written my next poem in honour of my cat i call it ode to spot felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature an endothermic quadruped carnivorous by nature your visual olfactory and auditory senses contribute to your hunting skill and natural defences i find myself intrigued by your sub vocal oscillations a singular development of cat communications that obviates your basic hedonistic predilection for a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection a tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents you would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance and when not being utilised to aid in locomotion it often serves to illustrate the state of your emotions\ncommander you have anticipated my denouement however the sentiment is appreciated i will continue oh spot the complex levels of behaviour you display connotea fairly well developed cognitive array and though you are not sentient spot and do not comprehend i nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend\ngeordi active scanner output has increased by twenty six percent\ngeordi may i make a personal inquiry it concerns my poetry reading\ni noticed that many spectators seemed distracted during my presentation was my poetry uninteresting\nthank you and\ndid it evoke an emotional response\nyour hesitation suggests you are trying to protect my feelings however since i have none i would prefer you to be honest an artists growth depends upon accurate feedback\nthen i did not succeed in my efforts\ni am reading a massive explosion\ni am attempting to localise it it is cargo bay four\nthe field imbalance has subsided\nwhat is it\nare you all right geordi\ni will run the integrity scan\ni have just started the scan did you not go to sickbay\nthat is not possible my internal chronometer indicates you have been gone for exactly one minute fifteen seconds\ncomputer what is the time please\nyou are correct ninety two minutes seventeen seconds have passed since you left the room\ni have no memory of events during that period when we are finished here i will perform a self diagnostic\nsensors are functioning normally they are detecting a subspace particle emission originating from within this room\nthe emission is emanating from this direction geordi\nthe structure of the bulkhead has been altered on a subatomic level the metal itself is in a state of quasi molecular flux\nit appears to be composed of spatially inverted te tryon particles we believe they are emanating from a tertiary subspace manifold\ni have completed myself diagnostic and have confirmed that i was not aboard the enterprise for ninety minutes seventeen seconds yesterday afternoon\nwhenever i am on the ship the warp field leaves an electromagnetic signal on my internal servo fluid system between the period of twelve fifty four and fourteen twenty six hours that signature is missing\nit appears to be the beginnings of a spatial rupture\nat the rate the rupture is expanding we will soon be in danger of hull breach\nno sir the spatial rupture is creating severe nucleon ic interference it is impossible to obtain a positive lock on the bulkheads\nte tryon particles have a random momentum our sensors can not track them sir\nthe rupture has expanded another four point two percent\nwithout further reinforcement containment field integrity will fail in approximately fourteen minutes\nat the present rate containment failure will occur in approximately nine minutes\ncaptain the containment field is beginning to fluctuate failure anticipated in\nthree minutes eleven seconds\ndata to engineering the graviton pulse is having an effect te tryon emissions have decreased by nineteen percent\ncaptain additional subharmonic s have appeared they are reinforcing the te tryon emissions they appear to be counteracting the graviton pulse\nthe rupture is beginning to expand again sir\nte tryon emissions continue to increase the rupture is still expanding\nhull breach is imminent\nthe rupture is beginning to close sir\nthe rupture is eightysix percent closed\nbased on the information gathered by commander rikers tricorder we have determined that the molecular structure of the alien life forms is solano gen based\nthe tricorder readings indicate they created a small pocket of our universe in their laboratory to keep those they abducted alive\nno sir we were unable to track it once it left the cargo bay\npossibly they were simply curious explorers like ourselves\nis there something wrong sir\nokay lets give it a try\ncome on work\nwhere\nyes but the question is why ive made modifications to the sensors before but nothing like this has ever happened\non our way sir\naye sir helm wont lock to those coordinates sir\nyes cold\nlong it was long\nno it was dark\nthere was something else there over the head of the table a metal swingarm computer create a metal swingarm double jointed total length one metre connect it to the head of the table\nmore like clicks clicking sounds\nlieutenant shipley lets get a triangulation on these sector points\nwell the clusters a lot more dense than we thought its going to take three days just to map out one tenth of it\ni think we ve found a way to speed that up a bit we ve been testing a way of channelling warp energy directly to the main deflector grid it should enhance the long range sensors\nwed channel it through the mains on deck four near cargo bay four\ndata lets get those field taps online\ni cant wait to see what hes come up with\neverythings in place warp grid couplers subspace field taps all right lets do it lieutenant shipley initiate warp power transfer\ncome on work\ninform astrophysics that the new laforge sensor array is online and awaiting major scientific discoveries\nsure data what is it\nwell it was very well constructed a virtual tribute to form\nand what\nwell\nwell your poems were clever data and your haiku was clever and your sonnet was clever but did it evoke an emotional response to be honest no i dont think so\nno its not that you didnt succeed you accomplished a lot but if you want to touch people dont concentrate so much on rhyme and metre think more about what you want to say instead of how your e saying it\nthats the power grid warning\nwhere\nive got three people in there damage control medical team to cargo bay four lets go\nand theres no evidence of an eps explosion\ni think my modification to the sensor array may have caused a pattern recognition failure\nthats my guess\naye sir\nsure commander goodnight\ngordon\nits laforge\ngood morning\ncommander its oh seven hundred hours\njust before the grid alarm sounded we were running warp power through this junction somehow it must vet ripped the internal scanners\nyes but the question is why ive made modifications to the sensors before but nothing like this has ever happened\nexcuse me\nim sure we could all use a little shore leave after this surveys completed\nyeah data im wondering if you could give me a hand i need to run a structural integrity scan i want to make sure that none of the conduit was\nthis is the second time today that my visors just cut out like that\ni dont know i just had a very weird feeling may be i should go to sickbay\nthanks data\nan infection from what\nhows the scan going data\ndata ive been there for over an hour and a half\nim telling you data ive been gone for over an hour\nwhat have you been doing all this time\nyou know first we picked up a false explosion then my visor cuts out twice and now you lose an hour all in the cargo bay laforge to engineering i want a diagnostic team to cargo bay four immediately\ndont tell me this cant be right data come here and take a look at this would you i think we have another sensor glitch\nfrom within this room thats impossible\nthis is where it gets a little wild captain behind that panel is a junction we were using to transfer warp power to the sensor array were reading a subspace particle stream emanating from that junction\nwe dont understand it either sir something from that deep in subspace shouldnt be able to exist in our universe but there it is\nnot unless it spreads if it does we can be am the bulkhead into space and erect a force field in its place\naye sir\nwhen my visor cut out in the cargo bay i had a weird feeling too it was something about a smooth surface it was smooth and cold yeah it was cold\nright like a bench or a table\nyeah and it had a rectangular shape\nits too high computer reduce the height of the table by twenty five percent\nyeah thats starting to look right\nthere was a light right in my face a bright light computer give me a bright light right above the table\ni couldnt tell it was above mean over headlamp\ni dont know it was at least two or three metres above brighter brighter\nive been in this room before\nare you sure\nwere on it sir\nany progress with the analysis lieutenant\ndata the te tryon emissions have intensified they seem to be focusing in this direction coalescing here they rereading as a point of subspace energy\nthe te tryon emissions are modulating in a way that looks like somebodys controlling the energy you know the signals from the modifications i made to the sensor array some of them dig pretty deep into subspace maybe they caught somebodys attention\nmaybe we should try surrounding it with a subspace containment field\nweve set up a containment field in cargo bay four but the rupture just keeps expanding id say we ve got another five or six hours before it breaches the hull\nwe think we can close the rupture by neutralising the te tryon emissions with a coherent graviton pulse but wed have to do that at the source\ngood question the emissions are coming from a tertiary subspace domain but subspace has an infinite number of domains its like a huge honeycomb with an endless number of cells we need to isolate the exact cell that these emissions are coming from\nthats a good idea but theres no way to get that device to the source\nif you had a homing device we could track it to your location in subspace and as soon as they send you back to the ship we could transmit the graviton pulse and neutralise the te tryon emissions\nive locked this tricorder into a continuous cycle that way it ll keep recording whether you open it or not hopefully you can bring back some information about their domain weve modified a sensor relay emitter to transmit a subspace beacon when this indicator lights up it means that weve locked onto your location\ni still cant locate the homing signal weve covered the entire upper subspace energy band were extending the scan to adjacent levels\ni can try to augment the field with auxiliary power but it wont be much\naye sir\ncaptain ive located the homing signal locking onto it now its coming from a subspace energy level of sixteen point two kev\ninitiating pulse now\nlooks like somebody is fighting back\ni can try to set up a random frequency shift if we can keep them from guessing our pulse modulation they might not be able to compensate\ntheyre reacting faster than we can shift frequencies shipley programme the emitters for full spectrum pulse compression i want to channel all of the graviton energy into a single burst lets see if they can handle that\nrecharge the emitters lets hit them again come on\nwere almost there one more burst should do it\nwe think thats why they couldnt come through into our space as easily as they could take us into their s they needed to learn how to re modulate their cellular energy states in order to survive in our universe\nthats probably what they were trying to do in cargo bay four create a pocket of their universe in ours\nit looks like they found us initially by discovering my modified sensor signal we should warn all starfleet ships not to make that same mistake\nmaybe it was a probe of some kind\ndoctor crusher you d better take a look at this\nshe said if they re not squirming we won tea tem\nah mister worf my good klingon sir welcome what a pleasure it is to have you with us again so soon so lieutenant haircut today trim your beard\na hat rim of course\noh no just a little off the top i took way too much off last time i was just telling my colleague mister setti how thick and luxuriant klingon hair is its such a pleasure to cut sometimes i get carried away all those away missions the wind and dry air the elements really are harsh on the hair id like to suggest that you start using a conditioning agent\ni promise not too much off the top\nwhats causing it\nbut i thought that te try ons were unstable in normal space\ndoes it pose a danger to the ship\nwell keep that option ready in the meantime proceed with the analysis\nte try ons like the emissions in the cargo bay\ncomputer are there any members of the crew of the enterprise missing\nidentify them\nwhen did they leave\nhow did they leave\npicard to bridge\nraise shields and i want a level four security alert i need to know if anyone comes on or off this ship\nmister laforge mister data i believe that if we find the source of those te tryon emissions well find the missing crew members\ninitiate a metallurgical analysis of the ships hull subspace field incursions may have left a trace\ncan we still beam the affected sections out into space\nhas your analysis suggested anyway in which we might seal this rupture\nif someone home don to the subspace signals created by our modified signal array could we do the same to them track the te try on emissions to their universe\nwell we could wait as long as possible for you to be returned number one but when the spatial ruptures begin to threaten the ship then we would have to transmit that graviton pulse\nperhaps theres a way that we could give you an advantage a way of keeping you conscious after they have taken you doctor can you develop some counter agent to the neuro sedative that they have been giving the crew\nmake it so mister laforge begin work on that homing device\nmister laforge report\nmister data your status\ncan you divert more power to the containment field\nmake it so\nstandby to initiate the graviton pulse\nmister data how much time\nwe cant afford to wait any longer begin the graviton pulse\ncan you strengthen the graviton pulse\nwhat can we do to prevent this from happening again\nhave we any idea what came through the rupture before we were able to shut it down\naye sir helm wont lock to those coordinates sir\nis there something wrong sir\nwhat do you recommend\nsorry im late i overslept again what have we got\nthree days\nthat sounds like that ll use up a lot of warp energy\nokay lets give it a try\ni wouldnt miss it for the world\ni dont understand i can barely keep my eyes open\ni have no problem getting to sleep then i think im sleeping all night when i wakeup i feel exhausted\ntwo three days do you have to hold that thing that close im sorry ive been on edge all day\nnot that i can remember\nwhat do you recommend\nwhat is it\na hot milk toddy your e kidding\nwell at this point ill try anything\nthanks\nsensors seemed to think there was\njust a sensor glitch\nlets perform a level three diagnostic on the internal sensor network and make sure that we have nt overlooked anything\ncould we pick this up in the morning geordi get a fresh start would you do me a favour stop by my quarters oh seven hundred hours im having trouble waking up\ngoodnight\nwho is it\ncome in\nmorning i just went to bed\nand it showed up as an explosion\nwe cant waste time chasing down sensor ghosts we should probably keep the whole array offline until we can get take a closer look\ni know the feeling the past few nights it seems like as soon as my head hits the pillow its time to get up in the morning\ndefinitely keep me posted\nensign rager cartography needs a better position to study cluster thirteen bring us about heading one twenty three mark four\nfirst time navigating through a globular cluster ensign you have got to compensate for gravimetric interference before\nno i dont know put us back on our original heading ensign\nwhen i sat down at the console it triggered a response like i had been trapped i had to get out of there\nnoi felt like i was disconnected like it was something i had dreamed\ndid any of them know why they d the response\nmaybe we should all get together\nit was vague the way you recall a dream i remember the sensation of feeling trapped and something about a smooth surface\nmay be theres a way we can all help ourselves to remember more\nno it wasnt made of wood it was smoother more metallic\nyes it was dark i couldnt see beyond the table\nyes i felt trapped by the console but it wasnt like this there was something else here\nyes there was a restraint it was flat and metal it was made of metal it came down over my legs nono it was across my chest right here\nyes it was part of the table it was here it was right here\ncomputer put controls on the restraining arma control panel lights\nyes yes there was a sound computer there were noises coming from the darkness strange like whispering\nlouder faster more of them\nweve all been here before\nwhat is it\nwhat\nother than the te try one missions in cargo bay four our internal sensors havent recorded anything unusual in the past three days\nhow do we find the source\nyes there is give it to me theyve taken me for the last few nights if im right the same thing ll happen tonight\ntheyre going to take me whether i want to go or not\nunderstood\nim willing to take that risk\ni hope its enough\nunderstood\nlike putting a

something like this an intense emotional response provoked by an object\nno they couldnt explain it anymore than you could you know at this point im not willing to say its coincidence\ntalking about it would help you understand your response im going to find out if anyone else on the ship has had these kind of experiences\nwill you told me you had an unusual experience when you sat down at the

off a multitude of subtle signs that communicate our emotions\ndoesnt love always begin that way with the illusion being more real than the woman\nwell i think ill be leaving\ntwo s company\nthis is your diversion number one not mine\ni dont dance\nno thank you\nexit\ncaptain to bridge situation report\ncomputer explain red alert\nwhy wasnt i notified\npresent condition\nlocate lieutenant commander data\nexplain\nevacuated was the condition that critical\nposition report\ndestination\nami to understand the by nars have stolen the enterprise\nits the by nars and your e part of this\nthat explains riker what about me\nwhat do they want with the enterprise whats their purpose\ncome on number one we ve got to regain control of our ship\npicard access captains log supplemental we now know who has commandeered the enterprise the by nars we cant communicate with the bridge commander riker and i will now try to regain control of our ship\nthis way\nthats our first stop verify containment and initiate auto destruct\nour ship has been commandeered by a force of unknown size and intent were here alone we must assume the worst\nif we dont regain control then no one else must have it either now this is the one decision involving the operation of this vessel which requires you andi to be in total agreement\nas to that theres no option\nthats sufficient to get to the bridge once there either well get control of the ship and shut off the auto destructor we wont this vessel must not fall into hostile hands\nset auto destruct sequence\nthe only place we can stop this is on the bridge lets go\nan enormous amount of data is being received and stored in the main computer\nits another piece to of puzzle\ntheyve locked it off we must find another way to get in\nno it takes several seconds to materialise you wouldnt stand a chance\nno well both beam in simultaneously in two different areas of the bridge with luck one of us will be a distraction\nset coordinates for main bridgeport forward for mean daft for you\nset phasers on stun number one good luck\nwhy did you steal my ship\ncancel auto destruct\nthey appear dead lets see if we can get some answers from by na us\nwhat about all the people in that world who are totally dependant on their computer are they still functioning\nthey went to an awful lot of trouble to clear computer space lets see what they ve stored\nmaybe they did\nmay be\nso their only choice was to transfer all the stored information and shut down until after it passed and then reactivate their system and transfer the information back to this main computer\nso what went wrong why are they dying\nwhy didnt they say something why didnt they just ask for help\nis there anything we can do\nthey wouldnt intentionally hide it or make it difficult for us to find it must be right in front of our faces\nstarbase 74 this is the enterprise do you readme\nwell go into that later right now i must speak to lieutenant commander data\ndata the by nars have stored an enormous amount of material in our computer we need to access it we cant\nyes i know that data but what could it be\nthey want us to find it they would have kept it simple\nwould they have kept it that simple try it picard out\nnow access the file start the transfer\nlet me get on the other position the by nars always work in pairs maybe that is also required it appears to be successful their systems started up a resident diagnostic programme is running their system is absolutely incredible\nwhy didnt you just ask for our help\nso you stole it\nno one has been hurt you have achieved your objective you have your planet back in order we have our ship well its been some time since i had the conn but not to worry number one youre in good hands starbase 74warptwo engage everythings under control\nwere fine everything is in order but now i want a complete check all systems all divisions\nturn them over to quintero s there will be a hearing\npermission granted\nmaybe it was all part of the by nars programming but you know number one some relationships just cant work\ncommander quintero s request permission to come aboard\ncaptain\ncommander you relate we expected you a week ago\nis there anything specific you wish to report or that we should be aware of\ni knew you would be i was in charge of the team which put her together\ntheyre not gentlemen or ladies commander they are a unified pair theyre always together this is one zero and this is zero one they just finished upgrading the computers on the wellington did a great job\nthey work very quickly but it ll be very tight\nthank you captain i dont think well need you until were ready for inspection\nwhy not just ask them\nplease stand out of the way\nyou havent time\nlook your ship is almost clear\nthe trieste\nplus its sixty six hours away\ni havent seen them\nwhat makes you think so\nwere rushing repairs on the melbourne but its still eighteen hours until shell be ready theres nothing else you can do\nthis is starbase 74 captain picard what is your situation\nstandby to dock\nengage mooring beams and lock off\nwe were unexpectedly delayed at omicron pascal\nand are

advanced as ours\nive never been very good at organising my time off something ll turn up it always does\ni thought there were only going to be two of you\nis there a problem\nthen why are you acting so excited\nim not sure that i do maybe its probably nothing\nmay be im going to stroll the ship you ve got the bridge keep your eye on them\nyouve already got all the players you need\nno you know if you do that in par rises squares you lose the rhythm of the game\nno but win allright the pride of the enterprise goes with you\nworf its just a game a little friendly competition you work up a sweat

off all sensors reveal that all of the equipment on the planet is inert they can neither receive nor send any messages\ntheyre probably like these by nars here dying what is this all about why did they steal the ship and bring it here what is their purpose\ncaptain its enormous every byte of free space in the computer has been filled they must have made a core dump from their world to our computer i cant get ini wish they d left a note\nminuet\ntell me what this is all about\nthe enterprise has the only mobile computer large enough to handle all that information\nhow can we do that\nyes if we had the filename but we dont do you\nwe should call starbase 74 and see if anyone can decipher this\nthats the file itll work now\nso much for that idea\nbut there was a very good chance we would have said yes zero\ntheir reason is part of their binary thinking for them there are only two choices one or zero yes or no why did you lure me to the holodeck and hold me there\nwhile these things are being checked permission to leave the bridge sir\nwhat is a knock out like you doing in a computer generated gin joint like this\nyour e not minuet\nshes gone i tried variations of

and im willing to bet that by the time its over youll have a pretty good idea what field your e interested in\nsee all these readouts thats your heart rate your blood pressure all your vital signs youre in good shape you might just live to be my age\nnow all these tricorder s need to be tested before they get put in the supply containers that were taking tot agra\nany unit that doesnt put it

earth what was the reaction in the q continuum q\nwere they pressured to return were they threatened with any punishment if they didnt q\nwell the circumstance of their deaths quite odd a tornado somehow escaped the weather modification net and touched down in only one spot amandas home q\nbut tornadoes develop from existing stormfront s but you see there were no stormfront sin kansas that day witnesses reported that the funnel materialised spontaneously directly over amandas home destroyed it and disappeared q\nwere amandas parents executed by the q continuum q\nthen i think she has a right to know that before she makes a choice about her future q\nyou would be so despicable q\nso what have you concluded does she live or does she die q\nlook i have no reason to believe that q is lying he claims he has orders from the continuum if amanda can not prove that she is fully q then he must kill her\ni agree with the counsellor amanda deserves to know the truth of her situation we have no right to withhold such crucial information from her but it isnt going to be easy telling her\ntheyre not convinced that you are fully q and they are also responsible for your parents death\namandas question deserves an answer q youve made yourself judge jury and if necessary executioner by what right have you appointed yourself to this position q\nyes i recall how you used your superior morality when we first encountered you you put us on trial for the crimes of humanity q\nyour arrogant pretence at being the moral guardians of the universe strikes me as being hollow qi see no evidence that you are guided by a superior moral code or any code whatsoever you may be nearly omnipotent and i dont deny that your parlour tricks are very impressive but morality i dont see it i dont acknowledge it qi would put human morality against the qs any day and perhaps thats the reason that we fascinate you so because our puny behaviour shows you a glimmer of the one thing that evades your omnipotence a moral centre and if so i can think of no cruel ler irony than that you should destroy this young woman whose only crime is that shes too human q\nim on my way\ncan you correct the

structure is now consistent with those of pre adolescence but as far as we can tell only their bodies were changed\nwhat about the energy field the shuttle passed through\ncaptain i need to run some additional tests jr\ncaptain may i see you privately for a few moments jr\nnot yet im still waiting for some test results jr\nwell be ready jr\njean luc we need to talk jr\nid rather not have to take that step jr\nthats true for now but this could be the first stage of a condition that may begin to affect your mind as well jr\nnot yet what i do know is that the captain of this ship has undergone an extreme physical transformation the ultimate effects of which i cant even begin to guess jr\nyou are still jean luc picard what do you think you should do jr\nthis is captain picardsryboviroxic nucleic structure from a tissue sample i took this morning its the same as a sample i took before the accident except its missing several of the key vir oxic sequences\nis one of the key factors in our development during puberty unlike dna which never changes rvn takes on some additional vir oxic sequences during adolescence those sequences determine how we develop physically\nexactly somehow those sequences were eliminated in the captain and the others during transport\nwell we have a couple of options these are the plants keiko was carrying on the shuttle whatever turned the crew into children turned these plants into seedlings i accelerated the growth on one of them and it developed into a perfectly normal adult plant\nno but at least we know that if we do nothing at all they will probably grow up just as they did before\nhowever i do have the adult patterns of all four of them i might be able to send them back through the transporter pattern buffer and replace the missing sequences but we cant even attempt that until we know why this happened in the first place if somehow they were to lose more vir oxic sequences\nif the transporter only registered part of the patterns that would explain why the key sequences are missing\ni think so as long as there snore version field to mask their patterns we should be able to do it chief can you adjust the molecular imaging scanners to accept\nim loading the adult patterns into the buffer\nhow do you feel\nalmost it is being stored in shuttle bay two sir jr\nwe ve been scanning the area since entering the system but our readings are being disrupted\nextreme fluctuations in the electromagnetic field however there is no evidence of stellar or seismic activity which would cause the interference\nminor damage to one ship its shields are holding\nsensors and secondary generators are offline life support down to sixty seven percent\ni am detecting transporter signatures in three cargo bays we are being boarded sir\ncome with me\ncome on get up there up up\nwell of course i do human i am not stupid\nyou were on the most beautiful planet in the quadrant and you spent your entire shore leave in a cave\nsos my father ro\nyou know you make a pretty cute kid ro jr\nwere you this much fun when you were a kid ro jr\nwhat about now youre not in that camp anymore ro jr\nyour e not supposed to do anything thats what relieved of duty means ro jr\nyour e right lets go play ro jr\ni havent been young for a long time and i intend to enjoy every minute of it ro jr\nwhat are you going to do go back to your room and p outro jr\nokay okay\nwell this is exciting ro jr\nid rather be doing almost anything other than sitting here and watching you sulk ro jr\nsure it bothers me but at the moment i cant do anything about it so i might as well enjoy it ro jr\nthere must ve been some part of childhood that you didnt loathe ro jr\ni bet you were a jumper a jumper you know someone who jumped up and down on furniture all the timer ojr\nyou were a jumper allright the quiet ones they always look so innocent you think you can turn your back on them next thing you know bam theyre bouncing on the bed ro jr\nah but you did have one sometimes and i bet you jumped on it ro jr\nyeah i can see it in your eyes you can barely resist the urge to leap up and start jumping around like a tarkas sian razor be astro jr\noh yeah oh yeah ro jr\nthats right and dont you dare join merola ren you dont like jumping on beds ro jr\ntactical advantage jean luc look at your team for a minute were children jr\nim not suggesting that we do but we cant act as if we were still adults jr\nwe look like children maybe its time we started acting like children\nits a childs computer remember computer can you show me a picture of the inside of the enterprise\n\nim not as young asi used to be ro jr\nyour e it\nthats the wonderful thing about crayons they can take you to more places than a starship ro jr\nonly if youre ready ro jr\nwell whats the hurry i mean the transporter will still be there why dont you pass me the royal blue ro jr\nthank you did you do this one to oro jr\nall of them back to the episode listing star trek and related

children with my little girl jr\nin primary care on deck fourteen jr\nive got the phasers captain ro jr\nid say were ready have you figured out how to get to the bridge jr\nhow did it go did commander riker get the message jr\nchief i got the sensor report on the shuttle breakup it looks like the breakup began near the starboard bulkhead\nmy visors picking up some torsional stress damage some micro fractures hang on a second whats this\nyeah but look\nthats not tr itanium anymore somehow the molecular structure of this alloys been changed broken down into its constituent elements\nyeah i want to get a sample of this down to engineering and run a metallurgical analysis jr\nwe think the shuttle was caught in a molecular reversion field which caused the structure of the ship to deteriorate when the field penetrated the hull it also began to affect the shuttle screw\nexactly with those key sequences missing the transporter reconstructed them as children\nthose last shots took out auxiliary power and emergency backup its going to take at least an hour to get\nwarp power back online\nenough where is the captain of this ship\ni am daimon lur in and i declare this ship to be a loss and open to claim according to the ferengi salvage code you will cooperate with our salvage operations or we will begin executing your crew jr\nwere not affiliated with the ferengi alliance we are in business for ourselves yes it will be highly profitable for an investment of two surplus klingon ships a few repairs and some weapons weve netted a federation starship and her crew not to mention a planet rich in venda rite\nthey have proved most helpful in extracting the mineral\nthe addition of your crew will greatly speed up the process as for your ship im sure that it will fetch a handsome price on the romulan market but before that can happen we need to regain access to your central computer\ni think that the mines on ligos seven can be very hazardous now how many people on your ship\nvery hazardous commander\ncome in\ni understand your son was here to see you\nwe ferengi do not bring our offspring along with usa board ship\ni think you will find that they can also be a weakness unless you release the computer to our control i will execute every child on this ship beginning with yours\nit is cruel to put children in danger by bringing them aboard a starship in the first place\nyou will release the computer and show morta exactly how to use it\ncome in jr\nmommy mommy\ni want mommy to readme a story jr\nnot you i want mommy\nthis is morta we have secured the bridge begin transporting all able bodied adults to the surface\nyou said they would not have time\nyou dare to blame me\nmy incompetence daimon you know that i am\nwell of course i do human i am not stupid\nwhat wait what is a fi rom act al drive just explain it to me\nready sir ro\nim trying sir\ni cant get a pattern lock\nive got them theresa forty percent drop in mass\ni may have lost one of them jr\ni could use a cup of coffee how about you jr\ncareful that shot jr\nsorry jr\nits i dont know but this feels wrong somehow jr\nwell technically yes jr\nno i mean of course your e my wife but your e also ten years old jr\nthats not the point jr\ni didnt say that but until they find a way to reverse this this effect its going hard for me to ignore the fact that your e a little girl jr\nwhats wrong sweetheart\nwhat if daddy reads you a story tonight will that be okay ill be right back\nkeiko its going to be all right i promise well work this out jr\ni dont know first officers log supplemental the enterprise has reached the ligos system and we have begun to search for the missing federation science team doctor crusher reports no progress on a cure for the members of the shuttle crew jr\nthere re some bulkhead fragments over here\nit looks like tr itanium from the hull\nno wonder the bulkhead shattered\nwhen i tried to be am them off i wasnt able to get a lock because there version field was masking part of the patterns\nphase inducers activated energy levels nominal\ntransposition matrix locked in that should do it captain jr\nand i found these pieces in the tertiary level of the dig theyre typical of second century marlon ian cookware look at those markings theyre very similar to early tagua n designs but the patterns are more intricate theyre much closer to burani an than tagua n\nit was a very rewarding experience look at these fragments theyre very nearly in perfect condition and yet they re seven hundred years old\ncan you identify the problem\nlay in a course and prepare to engage at warp eight as soon as were on board\nhard about full impulse ro\ntransfer auxiliary power to the inertial dampers\nthank you mister obrien another moment and\nwhat happened to the shuttlecraft number one\nwe cant afford to stay here any longer well leave a class four probe behind to study the energy field but the distress signal from ligos seven has top priority let me know as soon as you have any further information doctor number one your e with me\nof course the three of you will remain as needed to assist doctor crusher ro jr\nbridge jr\nmister worf prepare to launch a class four probe to study the energy field jr\ni realise how unusual this must seem my appearance is the result of an accident involving myself and three other crewmembers the effects of which doctor crusher is currently working to remedy i assure you iam captain picard\nmister data have you secured all of the shuttle debris\nvery well ensign as soon as mister data is finished take us to ligos at warp eight\nof course jr\ntea earl grey hot have you been able to determine the cause of our transformation\ni see there are one hundred and three members of the science team on ligos seven we should prepare shuttle bay three for a triage centre in case they have large numbers of casualties\ni see that ligos seven is prone to periodic volcanic activity perhaps the planet has entered an active phase\nall right letstalk are you here to relieve me of duty\ni am still jean luc picard my judgement my experiences my mental capacities are all intact\nbut you see no evidence of that\nyou are asking me to step down\ncommander riker please take command of the ship until further notice\ncome\nill have to speak to my tailor but otherwise im well thank you its just so ridiculous i cant really take myself seriously like this counsellor if doctor crusher cant find a cure if i have to stay this way nobodys going to take me seriously are they\nin that case i suppose ill just have to wait until i grow up again before i get another command which might be in ten may be fifteen years the question is what to do until then\n\nand be wesley crushers roommate i will admit that returning to the academy does have a certain appeal but ive spent my life looking forward going to the academy again feels like looking backward\nleave starfleet\nit would give me a chance to take up doctor langford soffer and accompany her to the ruins on suv in four but to leave the enterprise\nis everyone all right ro jr\nwe have to assume theyve also taken the bridge jr\nthey retaking all the adults down to the surface it looks like they re keeping all the children onboard the ship where was your daughter jr\nshes probably still there with the others i wouldnt worry we need to regain control of the ship options ro jr\nthats been locked out with the rest of the command functions ro jr\nagreed they might think they dont need as much of their crew to hold the ship we

complete\nseven card stud one eyed jacks are wild\nyou know i have always been a little suspicious of men with beards\ni dont know its as if they re trying to hide something\ni know but after the razor was invented i think beards became mostly a fashion statement\nsure and of course women cant grow beards\ni do but there s nothing wrong with that i mean women wear make up and nail polish i just think its time you men admitted it\noh well then you wouldnt minds having it off\nokay then why dont we up the stakes a little and ifiw in all off you shave your beards off\nim open for suggestions\noh i did that once when i was thirteen i couldnt change back fast enough\nfine if one of you wins i become a brunette are we on\nlooks like you have the hand to beat commander\nim in two hundred\nwait\ni almost got in under your guard worf\nwell ill keep that in mind next lesson\nonly my pride data thanks\nthat is a big question why do you ask\nwell the broadest scientific definition might be that life is what enables plants and animals to consume food derive energy from it grow adapt themselves to their surroundings and reproduce\nin general yes\nfire\nfire is a chemical reaction you could use the same argument for growing crystals but obviously we dont consider them alive\nthats true but you are unique\ndata ifi may ask have a seat what exactly are you e getting at\ni remember wesley asking me a similar question when he was little and i tried desperately to give him an answer but everything is aid sounded inadequate then i realised that scientists and philosophers had been grappling with that question for centuries without coming to any conclusion\nno i think im saying that we struggle all our lives to answer it but its the struggle thats important thats what helps us to define our place in the universe\ni dont think ive been very much help data\ndeliberately\nif they are intelligent life forms we have no right to force them to work for us\ntricorder sa rent alive\ncommander riker said you d still be down here he also said the exo comp failed the test\nthis was really important to you wasnt it\nwasnt its supposed to do that\ni distracted you im sorry\nwhat\ni thought this was just a simulation\nand then replicated the correct tool to eliminate the false overload signal\nthe exo comp didnt fail the test it saw right through it captains log stardate 463178at doctor farallon s request i have agreed to tour the station and assess the situation personally i must decide soon whether it is in starfleet s best interest to recommend the particle fountain as a reliable technology\nenterprise to commander laforge\ni am reading significant power fluctuations from the station core please report\ndo you require assistance\nenterprise to laforge what is your situation\ncommander laforge please report\nhow were you able to accomplish the repair so quickly\nenergise\nwelcome to the enterprise doctor i am lieutenant commander data\nand i have studied your design for the particle fountain i find the concept to be highly innovative\ni am curious how you were able to repair the power grid so quickly\nactually that is no longer the case i have recently converted my interlink sequencer to asynchronous operation which removed the performance constraint\nthe interlink sequencer is now bidirectional it compensates for the asynchronous mode distortion arising from the resonant field\nexo comps\nthe correct procedure would be to adjust the converter\na mode stabiliser\nyou have incorporated a micro replication system into the device in order to fashion tools\nso in a sense they are learning\nexo comps are highly sophisticated devices sir if they perform up to expectation their potential to advance this project is considerable\nthank you doctor i welcome the opportunity\ni agree doctor\ni have successfully completed fourteen separate tasks with this exo comp in the past hour i estimate it would take two people nine hours to complete the same tasks i would characterise the units performance as excellent\ni am confident they will commander laforge is especially\nit is not accepting your commands\ndoctor\ngeordi the interface circuitry which links the exo comp to the control pad is completely burned out\nno\ninteresting the number of new circuit pathways has increased by six hundred thirty two percent\ndoctor the new pathways do not appear to be interfering with the original circuitry\napparently there was a micro fracture in the conduit wall the fault did not register on our instruments\ngeordi are you implying the exo comp exhibited some form of self preservation\ncomputer perform a level one diagnostic of the exo comps command module\nhow can that be if the interface circuitry is burned out\ncurious computer access the exo comps sensor logs confirm that there was a failure of the interface circuitry within the last twelve hours\nhow and when was it repaired\nwhy would the exo comp burnout its own interface circuitry and repair it two hours later\ndoctor are you injured\ndoctor what is the definition of life\ni am searching for a definition that will allow me to test an hypothesis\nand you suggest that anything which exhibits these characteristics is considered a live\nwhat about fire\nyes it consumes fuel to produce energy it grows it creates offspring by your definition is it alive\nand what about me i do not grow i do not reproduce i am considered to be alive\ni wonder if that is so\ni am curious as to what transpired between the moment when i was nothing more than an assemblage of parts in doctor soon gs laboratory and the next moment when i became a live what was it that endowed me with life\nare you saying the question can not be answered\ni believe i understand doctor\non the contrary you have been a great deal of help thank you\ndoctor i must ask you to stop using the exo comps\nno it is not that i have reason to believe the exo comps are alive captains log stardate 463166i have summoned the senior staff in order to discuss commander data s theory that the exo comps area life form doctor farallon has attended only reluctantly\nsir when the exo comp left the access tunnel prior to the explosion it may have been attempting to save itself from destruction\nyes when you attempted to override the exo comp and send it back into the tunnel it responded by deliberately burning out its control interface\nthe computer diagnostic showed that the exo comp disabled its own interface\nhowever two hours later when it was aboard the enterprise and no longer in danger it repaired itself i believe the exo comp was protecting itself and if that is true it has demonstrated an awareness of its environment and an ability to adapt to that environment\ndoctor there is a big difference between you and a virus but both are alive\nthank you sir and until we have a definitive answer i believe it would be inappropriate to exploit the exo comps as labourers\nyes\nwe have created a small conduit breach in this tube the exo comp would normally require several minutes to complete are pair of this type once it enters the tube it will find that a plasma cascade failure is in progress\nthankyou for your help doctor\nas doi sir thank you\nthat is true\ni have completed thirtyfour additional tests and the results have been the same in each of them perhaps i was wrong in suspecting the exo comp was alive\nyou said earlier that i am unique if so then i am alone in the universe when i began investigating the exo comps i realised i might be encountering a progenitor of myself suddenly the possibility exists that i was no longer alone for that reason it he exo comp has returned\nin the previous thirtyfour trials i brought it back once the simulated failure occurred this time we were talking and i neglected to do that\ndo not apologise doctor i believe we have discovered something significant\nthe exo comp has replicated a different tool that is not the molecular fuser it had when it entered the jefferies tube doctor the exo comp not only completed the repairs it also deactivated the overload signal\nit was and the exo comp must have realised that it saw that there was no real danger and completed the repairs\ni see no other possible explanation\ncommander the particle fountain is continuing to surge at the present rate the radiation in the station core will reach fatal levels in twenty three minutes\na force field was activated on the station a few moments ago it is possible that commander laforge has established a low intensity deflector field\nno sir my readings indicate that it will fail in approximately twenty two minutes\ni estimate that it would take a minimum of sixty five minutes to properly configure the torpedo\ncommander i must object to that plan\ndoctor crusher and i discovered that the exo comp did not fail the test it is still my belief we are dealing with a new life form\ncommander if i am correct the exo comps will not allow themselves to be destroyed they have a sense of survival and they will shut down before they will comply with the order\ncommander that will not be necessary the transporter is not malfunctioning i have locked out the controls\ni can not do that sir\nthat is your prerogative sir under starfleet regulations direct insubordination is a court martial offence but i will not release the transporter\ncommander please do not think this is an arbitrary decision i have considered the ramifications of my actions carefully and i do not believe it is justifiable to sacrifice one life form for another\nit is true i am acting on my personal beliefs but i do not see how i can do otherwise\ni have observed that humans often base their judgments on what is referred to as instinct or intuition because i am a machine i lack that particular ability however it may be possible that i have insight into other machines that humans lack\nthen let me offer an alternative transport me to the station i will attempt a complete manual shutdown of the particle stream\ncommander if i give my life to save my fellow officers that is my choice the exo comps no longer have a choice\nthat sounds reasonable sir if they choose to go i would be willing to release the transporter lockout\nif the exo comps do not shut down after i have programmed them we may assume they are willing to go\nthey seem to be reprogramming the commands i have entered\nclearly they unwilling to be transported into the stream for detonation although they may have an alternate solution\nno doctor but they do have superior experience during their service they have interfaced with every part of the station core something none of us has done including yourself they may have another way to control the particle surge\nthose appear to be power taps\ncan you lock onto the exo comps\nit was the only way to save the other two\nthank you doctor i wish your work on the particle fountain had been more successful perhaps the exo comps will help you to reconstruct it\ndoctor\nyes sir i thought you might want to know why i would be willing to risk your life for several small machines\nno sir it was not when my status as a living being was in question you fought to protect my rights and for that i will always be grateful the exo comps had no such advocate if i had not acted in their behalf they would have been destroyed i could not allow that to happen sir\nwell thats why i want to increase the stream density that should boost the lift capacity by seventy two percent\nnot if we distribute the overload evenly throughout the system\ncommander i know your e here to evaluate this project\nand will your opinion be the deciding factor\nwhats your feeling so far\ncommander i know weve had problems here it seems like nothing s gone right its taking a lot longer than i thought to get the particle stream to full strength but i know it can work this is the direction that mining is going to take in the future and it should be implemented on care ma three\nall right i want to show you something ive been working on something that might help us complete this project more quickly ive used these on a limited basis\nit took four months to get the particle flux up to this level if we shutdown itll take another four months just to get it back\nthen well just have to fix the power grid\nwell heres the perfect opportunity to show you what i had in mind\nthis is anexo comp the experiment i was telling you about\nif it doesnt work well still have time to shut down the fountain\nmister data i was hoping id have a chance to meet you ive done extensive studies of your positronic network\nthank you\nthis should make it clear commander\nis it true that your computational speed is limited only by the physical separation of your positronic links\ni see but how did you resolve the signal fragmentation\nyes thats fascinating does the sequencer require any buffering system to eliminate interference\nwe ve been using devices like this on tyrus seven for years the basic unit is a common industrial servo mechanism a few years ago i started tinkering with one this is the result\noh the exo comps dont come close to datas sophistication\nthats what i call them lets say you had an antimatter flow converter that was fluctuating how would you repair it\nwith what\nokay let me input the problem into the exo compa fluctuating antimatter flow converter now lets see what happens\nits more than that i designed the exo comps to be problem solvers whenever they perform a task theyve never done before the micro replicator creates new circuit pathways within the units memory\nexactly the more situations they encounter the more circuit pathways they build they become better tools as they work\ncommander im hoping the experimental stage is over when are we supposed to brief captain picard on the status of the particle fountain\ngood ill have a proposal to make\ncaptain i know your e supposed to give your evaluation to starfleet today id like you to postpone that report another forty eight hours\ni realise that sir if youre going to make a recommendation to starfleet about using the particle fountain on care ma it seems only fair that you should see it operating at full strength\ni think i can complete the project and boost the efficiency of the particle stream if i use exo comps the new devices ive constructed\nyes sir ive been testing them on a limited basis but i think they re ready to be used on a larger scale\nim willing to take that risk\nthank you sir if possible id like commander data to work with me\ncommander theresa plasma conduit in one of the access tunnels thats ready to be sealed its the perfect job for anexo comp\nwell mister data what is your analysis so far\ni hope commander laforge and captain picard agree with you\nit didnt finish sealing the plasma conduit let me end it back in\nmay be theresa malfunction in the control processor let me see if i can override it\nim allright the control pad just overloaded whats the matter with this thing second officers log stardate 463155 the unexplained behaviour of the exo comp has greatly puzzled both doctor farallon and myself we have brought the defective unit to the enterprise for investigation\nthe exo comp came out of the plasma conduit we tried to override the commands and send it back in but it just shut down its been completely unresponsive ever since\noh no\nsometimes anexo comp starts forming large numbers of new pathways totally at random eventually it reaches a point where it shuts down just like this one\nonce the exo comp is this badly corrupted its useless you have to erase the unit and start all over again and theres no time for that now\nyes commander you have the right to point out that you told me so\nim sorry i guess im touchy these days\nwell id better get back to it thanks commander\ni wanted a quiet cup of tea before i went back gathering strength i guess\nthank you commander im grateful\nyou were right im trying to move too fast i guess i lack that conservative streak most scientists have i always seem to be out there on the edge taking chances\nanything to get to the top of the tree\nohno i fell all the time usually breaking a bone in the process i just never let it stop me\nyour e right about that commander ive spent the last six years of my life on this project its the first thought i have when i wake up and the last before i go to bed whatever it takes to prove this technology ill do it\nwith the help of the exo comps i think we will\ndont worry they know who sin charge\nwhy is there something wrong with them\ncaptain i object to being called here im wasting time that could be better spent elsewhere\ndo you have any basis for that conclusion\nthat could have been nothing more than a malfunction\nyour e anthropo morph ising these units like any mechanical devices they occasionally malfunction one time i saw anexo comp enter a reaction chamber for no apparent reason and vapor ise itself is that supposed to make me think it was depressed and suicidal\nand i have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for doctor soon gs accomplishment but his intention was to create an artificial life form i created the exo comps to be tools and there is a big difference between data and a tool\ncaptain thats absurd\nthats like me telling you not to use your tricorder\nneither are exo comps\nif it does possess a survival instinct as mister data claims it will exit the tube before the minute is up in order to save itself\nwell captain i think we ve spent more than enough time answering this question i hope the outcome wasnt too much of a disappointment for you mister data it certainly came as no surprise to me\nyour e welcome\nwere definitely making progress captain im not sure well be at full capacity within the forty eighth our deadline but well be close\nthats true but im sure its the last real problem\ni understand sir were going to do our best\nthis is strange primary power is still online\ni dont think so something seems to be drawing power into the main particle impeller thats not a good sign it could mean\nweve lost internal confinement the particle stream is beginning to surge\ncaptain i might still\nwhere stake nta he was over there near the impeller control\ncaptain youll be trapped here\nwere fine sir but captain picard commander laforge and one of my men farallon\ncommander we barely managed to transport off ourselves the field ionisation is too intense\nwed never get there in time\nwed have to configure the torpedo very carefully the shape of the shockwave would be critical but it could work\ncommander may be the exo comps can help us i can programme their bori dium power cells to explode on command they can be configured just like a photon torpedo but it would only take a couple of minutes\ni could disconnect their command pathways before i programme them\ncommander riker were ready\nall right ive enabled their command pathways\nthey havent shutdown\nsomething we have nt considered are you suggesting they have superior intelligence\ni must admit youve given me a lot to think about commander data i dont exactly know what the exo comps are but you can be assured that until i do i wont be treating them as simple tools\ni hope they will andi predict that in a year or two you will be able to recommend the technology to starfleet\naye sir\ntheyre here sir\nim trying sir i cant establish a pattern lock\nim sorry sir the transporter system just went dead theres some kind of malfunction\nsir new coordinates are being fed to the transporter by the exo comps the coordinates are inside the station core\naye sir\ncommander ive got a pattern lock\nim trying sir\nim sorry siri was only able to lock on to two of them for some reason i couldnt fix a signal on the other one\nactually im not sure yet why worf\nthank you commander\nsome of the most distinguished men in history have worn beards doctor\ndoctor it sounds to me like you feel beards are nothing more than an affectation\nwait a minute wait a minute what if you lose what are you going to give up\nyeah yeah well take that bet\ntwo hundred\ndoctor farallon the original design called for the particle fountain to lift five hundred kilograms per minute from the surface so far we have nt come close to that\nyeah but you realise of course your e going to be overloading the field generators in the process\ndoctor forgive me but maybe we should concentrate on completing this phase of the project before we start talking about redesigning it\nstarfleet is considering using a particle fountain on care ma three they want to know how feasible it is\nno not really ill make my report to captain picard hell make the official recommendation to starfleet theyll decide\nwell it seems to me the question we should be asking isis this technology is more efficient than conventional mining techniques\ni know this can be potentially very exciting\nlaforge here we have a malfunction in one of the power grids were losing particle stream confinement\nstandby im sorry doctor i think were going to have to shut it down\nlook e have less than five minutes before we lose confinement when that happens the particle stream is going to flood this entire station were going to have to shut it down then anyway\nyeah bow do we do that the defective grid is two hundred metres down conduit a two we have to disassemble four bulkheads just to get to it\nwhat is this\nunchanged for the moment but were working on it listen if this doesnt work soon were going to have to shut this thing down all right\nthe confinement field is at full strength particle flux steady all power levels are back to normal\nwere fine data the power grid is fully restored\nthe malfunction seems to have been repaired and operations over here at the station are all back to normal\nyou know im not exactly sure captains log stardate 463152 repairs to the particle fountain seem to have succeeded and it is now functioning smoothly doctor farallon is coming aboard to demonstrate the device that carried out the repairs\nwhy dont we set up in engineering\ndoctor this way please\nbori dium power converter a x ionic chip network its very impressive in terms of sheer computational speed this little guy might be able to compete with you data\na mode stabilizer very nice\nits impressive technology thats for sure once its out of the experimental stage there ll be plenty of applications\nat sixteen hundred hours\nwell i guess the only risk is in falling even further behind\nwell lets see what our computer has to say\nthats strange is there any evidence of secondary power surges\nbut whats going on there data increase the magnification of section gamma four\nwhat is it\nthat leaves you with only two its going to slow you down\ni only wanted to say that wed be happy to add on an extra shift to pick up the slack\nits okay you ve got a lot on your shoulders\ni feel sorry for her this project has had nothing but problems why did that plasma conduit explode\ni guess its a good thing the exo comp malfunctioned almost seems like it knew just when to leave\nof course not\non my way\nhere you are i thought you d be hard at work by now\nive come to tell you ive assigned two engineering teams to work on the particle fountain\nyou know i really want you to know that i do admire the work that youve done and im sorry the exo comps arent working out\nyou know ill bet you were the kind of little girl who was always climbing one branch higher than the other kids\nand i bet you never fell\nwell if it comes down to sheer determination i know youll get this particle fountain built\nmurphys team will cover gamma shift from twenty three hundred to oh seven hundred hours okay doctor ive split the engineering teams among all the shifts and if nothing else goes wrong that should be enough to help you finish on time\ndo you think theyll toe the line\ndata your e claiming that this exo comp may be alive because it demonstrated survival instincts right\nthen why dont we just threaten its survival again and see what happens\ndoctor were pretty much ready here you can begin programming it what weve done captain is to recreate a situation similar to the one the exo comp encountered in the plasma conduit\nyes sir were running a transient overload signal that will simulate a failure in exactly one minute\nokay beginning test programme now one minute\nfifty seconds thirty seconds ten seconds five four three two one that sit if this had been for real that conduit wouldve exploded with the exo comp inside go ahead doctor bring it back in\nit looks like theres still some difficulty with the phase selectors\nmaybe its another power grid malfunction\ncaptain a radiation field is going to flood this chamber we ve got to get everybody out of here immediately\nthe radiation is setting up a field ionisation effect captain we ve got less than a minute to beam out of here\nill get him taken ta\nyea him fine captain i only caught the edge of it hes dead\ncaptain if i can access the field emitters we should be able to establish a force field see if you can link your console to my command system subroutine\nokay here we go\nyeah i know the radiation levels are too high the emitters are beginning to deteriorate\nnot very long\nmaybe we can help him out see if you can access the emergency shutdown routine ill try to activate the ionic dampers\nwhat are they up to\ntheyre trying to distort the particle stream frequency that might open up a window that the enterprise can use to be am us out if they can modulate the radiation field itll work but they ll have to get the subharmonic frequencies to resonance the particle stream frequency is beginning to fluctuate theyre having a little difficulty controlling the feedback it may be more power than they can handle\nno sir weve done all that we can do its up to them now they rebalancing the power absorption rates its working the particle stream is beginning to distort almost at resonance they ve got it\none of them had to continue disrupting the particle stream absorbing that much power could prevent a signal lock\nthis is the captain we have arrived at the tyran system all senior staff to the bridge\nthe enterprise is scheduled to leave the tyran system tomorrow if im to change that plan ill need a very good reason\nagreed\ni understand one of these devices successfully repaired a faulty power grid\nmister laforge what are your thoughts\nmister data\nim inclined to agree i dont think that forty eight hours is too much time to risk particularly when the gains are so substantial you may proceed doctor\ndoctor i appreciate your time constraints but recognising new life whatever its form is the principal mission of this vessel please now mister data will you tell us what makes you think that the exo comps are alive\nif the possibility exists no matter how slight that these exo comps are lifeforms then we must examine that possibility\nclearly these are difficult issues to resolve we have to proceed very carefully so the first task is to test mister data s hypothesis\nmake it so\ni assume this is a simulation\nvery well proceed\nwell i consider this time well spent\ni hope for the sake of the project that i hope your e right doctor\nunderstood doctor the station must be evacuated\nthat is an order doctor now assemble all personnel on the transporter pad now picard to enterprise\ndo you readme\nprepare for emergency transport\nis that everybody\nmister laforge standby to transport\nmister laforge mister laforge are you all right\nall right link established\nim reading power fluctuations the force field is not stable\nhow long can we expect it to last\nwe have to keep it up long enough for commander riker to get to us\nmister laforge\nthe exo comps are siphoning power from the core\ncan we help them is there any way we can moderate the power transfer\ndrop the

everyone all right\nkelso can you get them off\nit wont last long in that radiation\nokay we ve got twenty two minutes i want some options\nthen we need to shut down the particle fountain what if we

it done now that means delta shift will be due to come on duty in two hours i expect you to have it fully manned and ready when it does is that clear\nhe was your first officer for five years\nof course he is jean luc im sure it ll all workout captains log stardate 463582 the enterprise is on course for a rendezvous with the cardassian ship re klar fortunately i still have time to prepare the ship and crew for the task ahead\ni want you to install a bypass between the main phaser array and the secondary generators i also want to run the main deflector pathway through the warp power grid and the auxiliary conduits through the lateral relays you may have to reconfigure the transfer interface\nim aware of your current design system its not good enough if these negotiations fail we could find ourselves in a war zone and if that happens i want to be loaded for bear\ngood now these stations should be devoted to damage control and weapons status from now on see that they re manned at all times\nmister data how long before we reach the rendezvous point\nschedule four battle drills one for each shift run a series of simulated attacks from a cardassian squadron i want you to conduct the exercises personally will get it done oh and get that fish out of the ready room data your e with me\npower transfer levels need to be upgraded by twenty percent the efficiency of your warp coils is also unsatisfactory\nim not interested in the specs geordi the efficiency needs to be raised by at least fifteen percent\nvery good data thats exactly what i want you to do\nwere not on a research mission get it done in two days\nthen you d better get to it geordi it looks like you have some work to do data\nyes\ndeanna come income in\nthe latest masterpieces from my son its an elephant i think\nim glad you re here id like to go over the duty roster with you\nive noticed some resistance\ni see your point this all could be very unsettling to them\nim glad you brought this to my attention deanna unfortunately i dont have time for a honeymoon with the crew youve clearly given this a lot of thought so id like you to take charge of the morale situation please see to it that they make the adjustment to the new routine quickly and easily i have a meeting with the new security chief in five minutes so the duty roster will have to wait thank you counsellor by the way i prefer a certain formality on the bridge id appreciate it if you wore standard uniform when your e on duty\nwell the enterprise will be monitoring your channel just in case you do need to transmit a signal\ndid you launch the probe i requested\nthank you jellico out i can see why he s still only a first officer\nive read your reports jean luci know you think highly of him\njean luc lets be candid for a moment the cardassians arent going to listen to reason and the federation isnt going to give into their demands and the chances are you wont be coming back from this mission of yours i want this ship ready for action and i dont have time to give will riker or anyone else a chance and forgive me for being blunt but the enterprise is mine now well here shoping you beat the odds good hunting\njean luci believe this is yours\nvery good ill be in my ready room\nyes\nnot he observation lounge is appropriate\nle mec is a cardassian and cardassians are like timberwolves predators bold in large numbers cautious by themselves and with an instinctive need to establish a dominant position in any social gathering\nin that case the trick is to be the wolf thats still standing at the end\nim captain jellico i believe you know commander riker and this is lieutenant commander troi lets get to it shall we\nthen im sure your e ready to talk\nif it alarms you i can ask them to leave\na great many people are depending on our efforts here gull emec we dont need to quibble over minutiae\ni can see your e not serious about these talks if the cardassian union truly wishes to discuss peace they can send someone who can negotiate in a civilised manner\nlet him stew for a few minutes then go in and tell him youve convinced me to meet with him one more time tell him im a loose cannon and that he needs to be more reasonable because im such an unreasonable man le mec will want to bring his own aides on board pretend to be worried that ill object and then give grudging permission for two aides no more understood\ngull emec a pleasure\nwelcome aboard for the past three weeks you ve been massing troops in staging areas assembling strike forces and pulling ships from their normal patrols we will not stand for this clearly provocative behaviour\nthen im sure you wont mind if we send a few starships into this sector for our own training operations\nyou gave up your claims on those territories when you signed the armistice you couldnt take those worlds by force so you want us to give them to you at the bargaining table\nso to speed up the process you are preparing for war\ni dont know what your e talking about\nvery well\nreassigned\nyes it would\nwhat have you got will\nwhich planet\ncan you detect any theta band subspace emissions coming from cel tris\nopen a secure channel to admiral nec hay ev priority two put it through to my ready room\nthose emissions you were so concerned about have just stopped id say one way or another our friends have finished their task\nno\nso would i admiral\ni wonder how permanent this is going to be\ncoil efficiency is well within specifications captain\nfifteen percent\nif we take this grid offline were going to have to shut down exobiology the astrophysics lab and geological research\nsure if everybody works around the clock for the next two days\ncommander hes asked me to completely reroute half the power systems on the ship change every duty roster realign the warp coils in two days and now hes transferred a third of my department to security\nyeah well i dont mind making changes and i dont mind hard work but the man isnt giving me the time i need to do the work someones got to get him to listen to reason\nwell then can i make a suggestion talk to captain picard maybe he can do something we just need a little time\nwhat is going on i have been waiting here for over an hour\nthis treatment is a deliberate insult to the cardassian union i have been kept waiting here for over an hour\ni did not agree to allow others into this meeting\ni am not alarmed but we did not\ni have here come to negotiate a federation withdrawal from the border not to be dictated to by some mere captain\nmay i present my aidesglincorakandglintaj or\ni see the federation spy network has again provided you with faulty information we are conducting routine training operations nothing more\nyour fleet deployments do not concern us however we are very concerned about your refusal to vacate those territories along the border which are clearly cardassian\nnegotiations which we have pursued in good faith unfortunately the federation has not been as forthcoming\nwe are preparing to defend ourselves\nthat has always been your position however i have heard reports that a small team from the federation has already been sent into our territory of course i dont believe it such an attempt would almost certainly fail and even if it succeeded it would trigger a very serious response on our part\nthen theres no need for worry a short recess would seem to be in order\nwhere is captain picard\nwell i hope his new assignment is not too dangerous it would be a shame if something were to happen to such a er such a noted officer\na challenge you should prove to be an interesting challenge possibly the most interesting to come through that door in many years\nwhy you of course picard jean luc serial numbers pdas h nine three seven dash two one five son of maurice and yvette picard born in labarre france formerly captain of the stargazer where you conducted extensive studies on the tab and subspace carrier waves dont look so surprised how could we have designed a lure for the captain of the federation flagship unless we knew something about his background\nin this room you do not ask questions i ask them you answer if im not satisfied with those answers you will die to be continued back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc

commander\nthank you no captain im afraid theres no time for the usual pleasantries im here to relieve you of command of the enterprise\nthe cardassian forces which were recently withdrawn from the bajoran sector have been redeployed along the federation border they have mobilised three divisions of ground troops and their subspace communications have been increased by fifty percent we believe that they re preparing for an incursion into federation space\ni didnt say war commander i said incursion our intelligence reports suggests that they ll try to seize one of the disputed systems along the border we think they re gambling that the federation wont actually go to war over one system\ni hope we wont need to make that decision we have decided to send the enterprise to meet with the cardassian representative and open talks were hoping that the presence of the federation flagship on the border will send a message to their leadership about just how seriously we view the situation\nthe captain your chief medical officer and security chief have been reassigned thats all i can tell you for now do any of you know edward jellico\nim giving him command of the enterprise this afternoon captain jellico helped to negotiate the original armistice two years ago and i believe hes the most qualified person to lead this mission the change of command will take place at thirteen hundred hours thank you\ni disagree the enterprise will be in a dangerous situation and i want someone on the bridge who has a great deal of experience with the cardassians no offence commander but thats not you\ncaptain\nhave you heard from our friends\nlet me know if you do id very much like to see them again\ncome\nadmiral welcome aboard\ncan i get you some coffee tea\ncomputer freeze programme you were five seconds slower that time\nmister worf its going to be far more difficult where were going\nim sorry i cant tell you that yet\nmister worf i have my orders im sure you understand that now doctor this deflector wasnt set properly it must be positioned so that the emitter array blocks the entire passageway or its useless\ni understand this is difficult all i can do is ask you to trust me\nall right mister worf i want you to time the doctor and me through that first tunnel and this time were going to pick up those five seconds\nto captain jean luc picard commanding

at the last overhaul i dont think they ll give you any problems but you might want to check out the port lateral\nvery well but i would prefer more recent intelligence on the exact layout of the installation the most current information we have is two years old\nshe gave me no choice\nnow that would be extremely helpful\none of the finest officers that i have ever served with\ncome\nyes i am the last time i had to train like this was for the academy marathon but im managing what can i do for you\nmy orders are to maintain radio silence until weve completed the mission\ncaptain i would just like you to know that commander riker is\nits not just my opinion hes been decorated by starfleet command five times hes been offered his own ship more than once i think if you just gave him a chance you d find him an outstanding officer\nthank you\nthank you enterprise well now that were underway i can tell you about our mission starfleet intelligence believes the cardassians are developing a meta genic weapon\nin a month the meta genic agent itself breaks down and dissipates completely leaving every city every road every piece of equipment perfectly intact\nstarfleet intelligence believes that the cardassians are developing a new delivery system one that would protect them from accidental exposure to the toxin they believe that the cardassians are testing a way of launching dormant meta genic material on a subspace carrier wave\nand because the subspace wave would appear simply as background radiation no one would realise what was happening until it was too late now for the past few weeks the tab and subspace emissions have been detected coming from cel tris three those emissions may indicate that a meta genic delivery system in operation\nvery little it was thought to be uninhabited until these emissions were detected starfleet believes that the cardassians may have a secret research lab located somewhere below the planet surface our orders are to penetrate this cel tris three installation and determine if the cardassians are actually building a meta genic weapon\ndestroy it at any cost when i was on the stargazer we conducted extensive tests using the tab and carrier waves one of the reasons i was selected for this mission is my familiarity with the methods used for generating them mister worf your presence here is obvious doctor your job will be to locate and destroy any biotoxins we may find\ni know a way of acquiring some discreet transport mister worf set a course fort or man five\nim not accusing you of anything\nwere looking for daimon solo k\ni have a business proposition to discuss\ngood please will you tell daimon solo k that were interested in transportation to cel tris three\nnow we understand that daimon solo k runs cargo there from time to time\nyes but if solo k were to go to cel tris three for legitimate reasons we would be interested in quietly booking passage for the journey\nbeverly make sure that your tricorder is keeping a precise map of the route we could very easily get lost in here\nthats typical of the tab and emissions you have to compress the detection bandwidth in order to determine the fix the source emission is five hundred metres east of here and seven hundred metres below\nits all right they recalled lyn ars a kind of cel trine bat theyre harmless\nthere doesnt seem to be a way around well have to rappel from here this is sheer granite well have to use fusing pitons\nunfortunately that would take several hours we dont have the time\nnow remember to control your descent and dont get the lines tangled\nall right\nthe installation should be about three hundred metres this way\ntheresa lava tube beyond here that runs for seventy five metres then it connects with another chamber we need to get through here this tube opens up beyond this crack we could widen the opening then we should be able to crawl through mister worf\nmake it so\nwell done mister worf\nonly a few more metres\nbeverly get out of there beverly\nare you all right\nwere nearly there can you continue\nlooks like a maintenance hatch to the installation im picking up three proximity sensors around it\nwe have no choice remember aim low fire in short controlled bursts\nnow\nits a trap come on\nwhat do you want\nso you concocted an elaborate ruse to bring me here why\nmay i present captain jean luc picard\nare the cardassians ready for a war\nwheres captain picard\nive heard of him i dont know that any of us have\nadmiral with all due respect its not necessary to give captain jellico command of the enterprise just to conduct a negotiation\nwelcome aboard sir im commander\nthank you and i you\nwell yes sir\nyes sir\nweve a standard three shift rotation\ner will sir\nwe have you assigned to cabins even thirty five decks i\ni dont know they dont usually go through the ceremony if its just a temporary assignment\ncaptain captain\ni was actually going to talk to you about delta shift a little later sir right now gamma shift will be on duty when we arrive and i will tell lieutenant mcdowell about the probe\nthere is no delta shift yet siri have spoken to the department heads about changing from three shifts to four and they assure me its going to cause us significant personnel problems\ni was going to explain this to you after the ceremony sir\nyes sir if you ll excuse me sir captain\nsir you may not be aware that our normal interface already routes auxiliary power through three separate relays\nill get right on it\naye sir\nif it makes you feel any better your enotalone captain jellico has made major changes in every department on the ship\nits not going to be me hes made that abundantly clear\nall right\nare you all rights ir\nits nothing urgent im sorry i bothered you goodnight\nbridge to captain jellico weve arrived at the shuttle departure coordinates\nyes sir i wasnt aware you wanted to be informed\nacknowledged feynman good luck\ngull emec has arrived hes waiting for you in the observation lounge\naye sir\nwell ill say this for him hes sure of himself\ngull emec as you know the systems are still subject to negotiation by the terms of the treaty\nthe federation will not start a war\nim not sure were picking up a lot of coded messages from a cardassian planet near the border\ncel tris three\nthere are some residual traces it seems there were emissions up until a few minutes ago\naye sir\nhalt\nif he doesnt pay up iknow three large ferengi who will not be so forgiving\ni didnt do it\nwhat do you want then\nwhy\nsolo k is a very busy very important man he isnt here but i could relay a message\nthats a cardassian planet\nsolo k is no smuggler\ni dont think he would be interested in dealing with federation spies\nwhy yes he is an extraordinary man\nyes\nwhen do you want to leave\nwill we\nsore\nmay i speak with you captain\ndefinitely an elephant\nid be happy to but first id like to talk about how the change in command is affecting the crew\ni wouldnt call it resistance more like uncertainty most of them had served under captain picard for several years they knew him they knew what he expected now theyre being asked to adjust to a new captain and a new way of doing things and theyre uncertain how to react\nand to you perhaps everyone just needs some time time for you to get to know and trust the crew and time for them to understand how you want things done\nof course sir\ncaptain i think there s been a slight miscommunication did you want to meet with gull emec in here\ni see\nso you re trying to establish a dominant position by making him wait for you the trouble with wolves is that sometimes the fight for dominance one of them ends up dead\nyes sir\nno hes not\ncaptain please we should listen to them\ntransfer complete enterprise now under command of captain edward jellico\ni relieve you sir\nyou increased the difficulty level sir\nit would be helpful to know something about our mission\nshuttlecraft feynman to enterprise we have cleared the shuttle bay\ni am not familiar with metagenics\nleaving the planet safe to be conquered wouldnt using such a weapon pose as great a risk to the attacker as to the target\nwhat do we know about cel tris three\ncel tris three is in cardassian space how will we get there undetected\nbats\nof course not first officers log supplemental we have rendezvoused with the cardassian ship re klar to begin diplomatic talks designed to ease tensions along the border\nyour e not afraid of heights are you doctor\ni doubt it\na phaser set to level sixteen should suffice\ni have her\nsensor echoes established but the false image will only last a few minutes the hatch is magnetically sealed but i believe i can bypass it\nready\ncaptain\nthe

    "episode 135": "transfer complete enterprise now under command of captain jean luc picard\nlets go\nno there are five more of them heading this way from another tunnel\nthere was no chance to go back for the captain we barely made it back to the ferengi cargo ship ourselves\ni dont feel so smart\nyour e still gambling hundreds of lives\nhave sickbay ready for the casualties your e about to send me\nit is possible that the cardassians were specifically interested in capturing captain picard\nthe meta genic weapon they were supposedly developing used a theta band subspace delivery system captain picard is one of only three starfleet captains with extensive experience in the tab and devices the other two are no longer in starfleet\nif your theory is correct the cardassians may be planning an attack somewhere in this sector\naye sir set course three five zero mark two one five and engage at warp eight point five\nin seventeen hours their hull degradation will reach dangerous levels they will have to leave before that\ni want this ship ready for action and i dont have time to give will riker or anyone else a chance and forgive me for being blunt but the enterprise is mine now\ngull emec i assure you that what the federation wants above all is the preservation of peace\ni dont know what your e talking about\nwhat evidence do you have of that\ncaptain picard and the others were sent to investigate reports of a meta genic weapon once ltris three its possible that they may have been captured but if they did escape theyll head for the lysh an system the enterprise is supposed to meet them there in eight hours will i want you to take a shuttlecraft and head for the rendezvous point the enterprise will have to remain here until the end game with gull emec is played out\nyou were smart not to try\nget some rest doctor will\ni want geordi to analyse the readings from beverly s tricorder tell him to scrutinize every detail of those caverns once ltris three\ni know you were close to him will but we dont even know if he s still alive under the circumstances a rescue mission would be foolhardy\nhes gone im sorry will but your e going to have to accept that i want those tricorder readings analysed by fourteen hundred hours\ncaptain picard was not acting under my orders\nno\nits not my concern\nim listening\nill have to discuss this with my superiors\nsend a message to admiral nec hey evi recommend that she reject le mecs proposal and deploy additional starships along the border\nno\nthat would play right into gull em ecs hand hes just waiting for some sign of weakness on our part before he starts making more demands\nare you questioning my judgment commander\nthen maybe its time you found other responsibilities your e relieved dont make me confine you to quarters as well\nthey went to a lot of trouble to lure a federation team to that planet why\nso they tailored a fake weapon to lure picard but why they must ve known wed change all his access codes and security protocols\nor something he was going to do in the future in case of a cardassian attack the enterprise will be assigned as command ship for this sector if the cardassians got wind of that\nthe question is where geordi i want you to conduct a discreet scan of gull em ecs ship look for anything unusual anything that might indicate where they ve been lately\nwhere could they have run into a dispersion field\ncould there be cardassian ships inside the mcallister nebula\nis there a federation system near the mcallister nebula that might interest the cardassians\ndata i want to beat minos kor vain one hour\nstarfleet now believes the cardassians are preparing to invade minos kor v aim convinced their invasion fleet is hiding in the mcallister nebula i intend to hit them before they leave it\nyou d have to have some pretty good evidence to convince me of that\nthis discussion is moot the plan has been approved and we are going ahead mister data by your calculations how long could the cardassian ships stay in the nebula\nall right worf prepare a series of five hundred antimatter mines with magnetic targeting capabilities\ngeordi were going to need a shuttle specially outfitted to operate in the nebula by fourteen hundred hours beverly youll need to\nthats right dismissed\ngood\nbeen a while since i flew one of these your e a pilot yourself arent you geordi\ni began my career as a shuttle pilot on the jovian run jupiter to saturn and back once a day every day\nthen you must ve done titans turn\nand pray like hell nobody saw you\nis that you\nami disturbing you\nmusician\nclassical contemporary\nah\nare you aware of our plans to attack the cardassian invasion fleet\nlets drop the ranks for a moment i dont like you i think your e insubordinate arrogant wilful and i dont think your e a particularly good first officer but you are also the best pilot on the ship\ni wont order you to fly this mission im here to ask\nwill you pilot the shuttle commander\nenterprise to shuttle were you successful commander\nvery well red alert standby to detonate the mines on my command\nopen a channel to there klar\nim not going to argue with you gull emec every one of your ships has a mine on its belly my fingers on the button and youre in a very bad position\nmister worf set off alpha four two\nthat was just a baby the big boys are sitting on your hull just waiting for me to say the word\nyour ships will leave the nebula one by one each ship will eject its primary phaser coil before setting course for the nearest cardassian base\nmister worf prepare to detonate\nexcellent oh and one more thing i understand your e holding a starfleet officer named jean luc picardi expect him returned immediately\ncaptain on the bridge welcome home jean luc\njust the way you left it may be a little better computer transfer all command codes to captain jean luc picard voice authorisation jellico alpha three one\ni stand relieved its been an honour serving with you\ni will father do humans have mothers and fathers\nwill you read to me tonight\nwhy do you say that\nmaybe they were interested in something that he did in the past something that happened while he was captain of the enterprise\nthey might have assumed captain picard would know those defence plans\naye sir\nit looks like they had some minor hull degradation along their warp nacelles the distribution pattern indicates a recent exposure to a molecular dispersion field\nthe mcallister c five nebulas just across the border its approximately seven light years from federation space\nits possible but they wouldnt be able to stay in there for very long the particle flux in the nebula would begin to break down a ships hull just after seventy two hours\nminos kor va is only eleven light years from the nebula and the cardassians tried to annex it during the war\ncaptain what if youre wrong what if the cardassians are in that nebula to conduct scientific research\nwere almost done sir ive shielded the engine nacelles and the transporter system so they wont be affected by the particle flux from the nebula\nyes sir\nis that right i was on that run myself for awhile\noh yeah you set a course directly for titan hold it until your e just brushing the atmosphere throw the helm hard over and whip around the moon at points even c\nyou know this trip into the nebulas going to need someone who can do titans turn in their sleep these mines need to be laid within two kilometres of the cardassian ships but the particle flux from the nebula will blind all the sensors except for this proximity detector your e going to need one heck of a pilot to pull that off\ni could do it but truthfully the man you want is commander riker hes the best there is\nweve lost primary navigation switching to secondary systems\nsensors inoperative\nthe proximity detector is working we should be able to read their ships at a distance of five hundred metres\ndo i want to know how close that was\nthen how do you explain the fact that a federation team launched an unprovoked assault on cardassian territory less than fourteen hours ago\nthen let me explain captain jean luc picard lieutenant worf and doctor beverly crusher landed once ltris three attacked one of our out posts in a brutal assault and killed over fifty five men women and children\nwe have all the evidence we need we have captain picard\nthe cardassian union has yet to decided how it will respond to this latest provocation but rest assured we will respond\ndo you have anything to say\nand if we wish to execute him\nthe selon is convention applies to prisoners of war which means you would have to acknowledge that he was captured during a mission authorised by the federation are you willing to make such an admission\nthen he will be treated as a terrorist\nthere is of course an alternative\nif the federation agreed to a complete and immediate withdrawal from this sector then we would be disposed to release captain picard and forget about this incident\nof course you have seven hours\nthis is cardassian territory captain your presence here is another deliberate provocation to\nyou cant intimidate us\nwhat are your terms\nbut that will leave us defenceless\ni will agree to your terms\nyou told me he would be ready to go\nget him cleaned up a ship is waiting to take him back to the enterprise captain picard if you ll go with the guards theyll take care of you\nyou should prove an interesting challenge possibly the most interesting to come through that door in many years\nwhy you of course and now the conclusion\nyour place of birth\nmothers name\nhes ready keep the serum at that level what is your current assignment\nwhat is your mission once ltris three\nhow many others were part of this mission\nname and rank\nwhat are the federations defence plans for minos kor va\nincrease the level slightly to point three one lets begin again shall we name\nplace of birth\ncaptain picard\nwe have already sent a message to to hv un three the nearest neutral planet they assure us they will dispatch someone immediately will you allow me to remove your restraints i understand that you are a student of archaeology did you know that cardassia boasts some of the most ancient and splendid ruins in the entire galaxy\napparently when they were first unearthed two hundred years ago they were the burial vaults contained unimaginably beautiful artefacts made of jevon it ear are breathtaking stone but most of those objects are gone\nwhat happens to impoverished societies the tombs were plundered priceless treasures stolen a few were preserved in museums but even those were eventually sold in order to pay for our war efforts\nlets not waste time arguing about issues we cant resolve would you care to tour the he bit ian burial vaults\nmy dear captain you are a criminal you have been apprehended invading one of our secret facilities the least that will happen is for you to stand trial and be punished but i am offering you the opportunity for that experience to be civilised\ncooperation we need to know the federations defence strategy for minos kor va\ncaptain we have gone to great lengths to lure you here because we know that in the event of an invasion the enterprise will be the command ship for the sector encompassing minos kor va\nwasted energy captain you might come to wish you hadnt expended it in such a futile effort\nare you in good health do you have any physical ailments i should know about beautiful isnt it the stone is jevon ite and now you know why it is so highly prized from this point on you will enjoy no privilege of rank no privileges of person from now oni will refer to you only as human you have no other identity first officers log supplemental i have returned from the rendezvous point in the lysh an system with doctor crusher and lieutenant worf captain pi cards fate is still unknown\ngood morning i trust you slept well\nthirsty i would imagine so well its time to move on\nyes im sure you have how many lights do you see there\nno there are five are you quite sure\nperhaps your e aware of the incision on your chest while you were under the influence of our drugs you were implanted with a small device its a remarkable invention by entering commands in this padd i can produce pain in any part of your body at various levels of severity forgive me i dont enjoy this but i must demonstrate it will make everything clearer\nsurprising isnt it most people feel at first that they can steel themselves against it but they re completely unprepared for the intensity of the pain that was the lowest possible setting\nbut ive told you that i believe you i didnt ask you about minos kor vai asked how many lights you see\ni dont understand how you can be so mistaken\nwhat is your current assignment\ni want you to be very careful with your wom pat from now on jil or ra now that she s separated from her mother she depends on you\nyes but human mothers and fathers dont love their children as we do theyre not the same as we are\nyes of course i will ill see you later\nyes i think so and unusually bright its amazing isnt it the way they re able to sneak into your heart i must admit i was completely unprepared for the power she had over me from the moment she was born\nwhy\nfrom the time jil or ra could crawl shes been taught about the enemies of the cardassians and that enemies deserve their fate\nwhat a blind narrow view you have what an arrogant man you are what do you know of cardassian history\nand what did peace and spirituality get us people starved by the millions bodies went unburied disease was rampant suffering was unimaginable\nbut we are feeding the people we acquired territory during the wars we developed new resources we initiated are building programme we have mandated agricultural programmes that is what the military has done for cardassia and because of that my daughter will never worry about going hungry\nshall we begin again how many lights are there\nwake up where were you\nwhat a charming picture the picard family voices raised in song is this whats keeping you from breaking memories of home and hearth images of happier times i must congratulate you youre remarkably strong will edi see no point in holding you further you may go someone will give you clean clothing before we return you to your ship\nwe will get what we need from the human female\nthe human who was part of your abortive assault team of course doctor beverly crusher\nnot a thing she s quite safe i wanted to finish my interviews with you before i interrogated her i had hoped it might not be necessary\nhe left us few options we had to kill him im more optimistic about getting what we need from the woman\nyou might be right ill have to determine that for myself\nare you choosing to stay with me excellent i cant tell you how pleased that makes me\noh your e awake have something to eat i insist boiled t a spare gg its a delicacy im happy to share with you\nwonderful wonderful i like you human most people become ill at the sight of live tas pari remember the first time iate alive tas pari was six years old and living on the streets of lak at there was a band of children four five six years old some even smaller desperately trying to survive we were thin scrawny little animals constantly hungry always cold we slept together in doorways like packs of wild get tles for warmth once i found a nest tasp arshad mated and built a nest in the eave of a burnt out building and i found three eggs in it it was like finding treasure i cracked one open on the spot and ate it very much as you just did i planned to save the other two they would keep me alive for another week but of course an older boy saw them and wanted them and he got them but he had to break my arm to do it\nwhat do you mean\ni fail to see where this analysis is leading\nbe quiet\npicard stop it ori will turn this on and leave you here in agony all night\nwhat are the federations defence plans for minos kor va\nthere are five lights how many do you see now\nhow many\nthat wont help i have many more\nenjoy your good feelings while you can there may not be many more of them ive just received word theres been a battle the enterprise is burning in space

normally\nits very romantic but until we know just what it was that walked off the holodeck i dont think we should be trying it again\na miniature holodeck\nit was then that i began to suspect that your brother did not die by his own hand that he was in fact murdered\nthat was the first clue watson the vial contained strychnine which as you well know induces violent muscular spasms it is difficult to imagine that someone in the throes of so gruesome a death could have held onto so delicate a container without shattering it\nexactly the vial was placed in his hand after he died\nthe cigar of course\nupon closer inspection of the room where your brother was found i discovered a fresh burn mark on the carpet further analysis of the ash revealed that the cigar was laced with strychnine\nwith practice handwriting can be forged it takes a trained eye to notice certain discrepancies for example whether someone is right or left handed\nyour brother was right handed the alleged suicide note was written by a left handed individual such as yourself\ncurious there seems to be a problem in the holodeck s spatial orientation systems\nsherlock holmes programme three a has demonstrated some very curious anomalies\nsince both planets are gas giants neither possesses a solid surface their atmospheres however will come into contact in approximately seventeen hours nine minutes\ndata to security send two officers to holodeck three\nthis contradicts everything we know about holodeck physics\nthere is also no way of knowing if the professors ability to exist off the holodeck is permanent it may be unwise to consider creating a second individual while this uncertainty exists\nwithin the next five hours sir\ncommand functions are being rerouted sir\nunknown sir\naye sir\nperhaps we should consider the transporter system it uses many of the same principles as the holodeck both for example are capable of converting energy into matter\nhowever if it were possible to lock on to the object it might re materialise with the same molecular cohesion as conventional matter\nset the pattern enhancers around whatever object you wish to transport i will proceed to the transporter room and begin modifications\ngo ahead lieutenant\nmodifications are complete\nstandby\nactivating pattern enhancers energising i am having difficulty establishing a pattern lock boost the confinement beam please pattern lock established\nenergising\nno it lost its cohesion as soon as the transporter cycle was complete\nagreed however we may be able to learn something from the attempt\ncomputer display the transport logs for the sequence just completed computer what is being displayed here\nthat is the correct log however no information\nis being presented\nit is almost as if\nour attempt to transport the chair never occurred\ngeordi\ncaptain i have determined how moriarty was able to leave the holodeck he never did neither did we none of this is real it is a simulation we are still on the holodeck\nthrough deduction sir lieutenant barclay and i tried to transport a simulated object off the holodeck something that has never been attempted since the transporter itself is a simulation the computer had no real data from which to create the transport logs\nthen i saw you working the with your left hand commander laforge is right handed sir a similar malfunction occurred in the sherlock holmes programme i was running before moriarty first appeared\nmoriarty appears to have programmed the holodeck to accept only his commands\nyou andi are real sir as is lieutenant barclay we entered the holodeck together when we first went to see moriarty\ni believe that is the case sir\nyou may have inadvertently given professor moriarty the means of gaining control of the real enterprise\nless than three hours\ndid moriarty release the voice commands captain\nwhen he was attempting to contact the real bridge he was in fact speaking to a simulation\nin away doctor however there is no physicality the programme is continuous but only within the computers circuitry\nas far as i can tell theres no evidence that his molecules are losing any cohesion they seem to be as immutable as ordinary matter\nmurdered huh good lord\ncigar\nthis is utter nonsense what about the suicide note it was written in my dear brothers own hand\nlondons greatest detective\nbut holmes the vial of poison found in his hand\nyou dont mean\nthen what was the cause of death\ner data its in his right hand\nfreeze programme laforge to barclay\nreg something went wrong with the holodeck programme again\nthanks reg we should get back to engineering data computer end programme and save\nwhoa who are g\nthanks reg see you later\nif their collision causes a self sustaining fusion reaction this is what we are likely to see the birth of a new star the enterprise will hold position until the gravitational instability subsides and we can get in for a closer look now i want triple redundancy on all of the sensor arrays well probably never get another chance to see something like this i dont want to miss anything okay\nwhat\nas far as i can tell theres no evidence that his molecules are losing any cohesion they seem to be as immutable as ordinary matter\nexcept the transporter re constitutes energy in a permanent form holodeck matter doesnt have any cohesion unless its inside the grid\nnothing would happen a holodeck object is just a simulation theres nothing there to provide a pattern lock for the transporter\nthats a big leap data i just dont think the transporter is going to accept simulated matter\nwe were just talking about using the transporter to beam the countess off the holodeck but i dont quite see how its going to work\nsomehow he managed to override the security lockouts and rewrite them the man is brilliant in any century\nyes captain i think ive found a way to reinstate your vocal authorisations give it a try\nthats it that should do it wait a minute it didnt work the computer wont release the command pathways\nwhy did you do that data\nwere still on the holodeck\nmaybe it was just a malfunction in the transporter\nif they tried it they must have thought they were onto something\njust because our transporter is real doesnt mean its going to work\naye sir\nthe gravity well is beginning to intensify\nits too soon to tell\nprofessor james moriarty\nleft handed would you very much mind telling me\nwhere is captain picardi she still captain of this vessel\nyou dont know anything about what happened do you i have been stored in memory for god knows how long and no one has given me a second thought\na holodeck character a fictional man yes yes i know all about your marvellous inventions i was created as a plaything so that your commander data could masquerade as sherlock holmes but they made me too well and i became more than a character in a story i became self aware i am alive\nbut here iam tell me has a way been found to allow me to leave the confines of this holodeck world\ndamn you picard he promised me something would be done i should have realised he would have said anything to get me to release my hostage\nhow long have i been locked away\nit seemed longer\nbut i was brief terrifying periods of consciousness disembodied without substance\ncall it what you will all i know is that despite pi cards promise hes done nothing just left me to go quietly mad\nid like to talk to him\nask him to meet me in the sitting room at bakerstreet that would be far more appropriate\nif you d missed my company i should think you d have summoned me before now\nit is also irrelevant what concerns me is finding a way to leave the holodeck\nand what did your finest minds come up with\ni see\nenough of this i no longer believe anything you say\ndo you really when this is over you will walk out of this room to the real world and your own concerns and leave me here trapped in a world i know to be nothing but illusion i can not bear that i must leave\nare you certain of that\nan object has no life i do\ni have consciousness conscious beings have will the mind endows them with powers that are not necessarily understood even by you if my willis strong enough perhaps i can exist outside this room perhaps i can walk into your world right now\nif i am nothing more than a computer simulation then very little will have been lost but if i am right mind over matter cogito ergo sum\ni think therefore i am\nthen perhaps you dont know as much as you thought\ncertainly sir policemen id recognise them in any century\nwhat else would ibe dear lady\ni ask only that i be allowed to explore this new world your vessel for instance what sea does she sail might we go above deck weather permitting of course\nmy god were adrift in the heavens\nextraordinary are we far from earth what is the range of this ship what means of locomotion does it use theres so much for me to learn i hardly know where to start\ngood good i want to start making plans determine what im going to do with my life\ndoes it really matter the point is im here and im eager to get on with life\ndont worry captain my past is nothing but a fiction the scribblings of an englishman dead now for four centuries i hope to leave his books on the shelf as it were\nyour century may welcome me but\nin considering all these vast possibilities i suddenly feel very much alone i am a man out of time captain and that isolates me you have been more gracious than i could ever have imagined i wonder may i impose on your generosity once again there is a woman the countess regina bartholomew she was created as a holodeck character for one of commander data s programs she was designed to be the love of my life could she also be brought off the holodeck\ni do i do believe you\nas i understand it i was endowed with consciousness four years ago when someone said to the computer create an opponent with a capacity to out think data or words to that effect could we not make a similar request on behalf of the countess\nis it morally and ethically acceptable to deny the woman i love so that you can put your conscience at ease are you saying that you will simply dictate how i am to live my life\nso long as i accept the terms under which you dole out those comforts captain i am a powerless man you hold my future my happiness my very life in your hands please consider my request\nyes you know all about that i stayed in the dungeon of your computer for years waiting for you to learn more it wasnt until i took things into my own hands that something got done\nyour computer designed her to be a person of impeccable integrity she would never commit a crime\nthe programme fashioned her for me to love but i must admit i would have done so anyway she is remarkable my life has not been the same since i met her i dont simply love her captain i adore her\ni have im afraid i had no choice but to take control of your vessel\nif you harm me siri will not be able to relinquish voice control of your vessel\nim just a fictional character i havent much to lose\nnot alone not without the countess\nim not so sure a deadline has a wonderful way of concentrating the mind\nthats because she isnt\nif you loved a woman like this lieutenant would you be content to let her remain a simulation\nyes just as it was given to me\nnonsense it was the only thing to do\nno iam unwilling to risk the countess safety i want to make sure nothing will happen to her\noh please proceed\ntheyre safe for now\nim afraid i cant do that\ni only want what you have the luxury of taking for granted freedom i want to leave this holodeck\nyour crewmates here in my little ship in a bottle seem a bit more optimistic\nthey attempted to use your transporter device to remove a simulated object from the holodeck\ntheir attempt was futile because their transporter was a facsimile i expect more from you\ni sense a distressing lack of enthusiasm on your parts\ni have nothing to lose commander\nthink my dear your e certain he said they had to uncouple the heisenberg compensators\ni have them running around like rats in a maze\nmy dear you are as brilliant as you are beautiful nonetheless there are things you do not understand now please you must let me handle this computer arch moriarty to commander riker\ncommander riker a pleasure as always\nthen im sure you ll be motivated to listen to me very very carefully i want to talk to you about uncoupling the heisenberg compensators\neverywhere my darling there are more worlds in the heavens than there are grains of sand on a shoreline\nill get you more dont worry i promise you youll want for nothing\nits time yes commander\nas are we\nwere ready here\nmay i present regina the countess bartholomew\nah yes i expect you want me to relinquish my hold on your vessel\nim afraid that wont be possible just yet\nand i intend to honour it i have no desire to see your vessel destroyed just give me one of your shuttlecraft and allow us to leave in peace\ni will not release your vessel until i am looking at it through a shuttlecraft window\nexcellent\nplease tell your captain im sorry i couldnt say goodbye i do wish i could see his face when he realises where he s been the last several hours\ndont worry commander youll soon have control of your ship\ncomputer prepare to depart\nindeed my dear it is a wondrous sight the first of many we are sure to encounter in our travels computer interface with the central computer on the enterprise\nrelease command function lockouts authorisation moriarty alpha two four one five nine\nyes my love\nof course my dear of course\nmister data if what you say is true then this is not geordi laforge are you certain\nprofessor its good to see you again\ni want to assure you that weve not forgotten you we spent some time investigating how you became self aware frankly it still remains a mystery\nwe have been wrestling with that problem too unfortunately without any success but we have turned our findings over to starfleet s most experienced theoretical scientists\nunfortunately they have not arrived at a solution either\nprofessor i am concerned to learn that you experienced the passage of time while you were stored in the computer memory i can assure you we had no idea that that would be the case\nprofessor i understand your frustration\nthat is not possible you can not exist outside this room\ncomputer exit\nalthough an object appears solid on the holodeck in the real world they have no substance\nprofessor you are a computer simulation\nprofessor i ask you to believe me if you step out of that door you will cease to exist\nhow is this possible\nprofessor will you come with me id like our doctor to examine you\nwell professor my crew will continue to investigate but for now it would seem you have accomplished a miracle the question is now that your e here what do we do with you\nprofessor i think there are some things of which you should be made aware\nno not adrift the enterprise is a starship capable of travelling through space\ni can give you books that will help\ni hope you will plan on remaining on board for a while there is still much that we need to understand about what has happened to you\nprofessor i feel it necessary to point out that criminal behaviour is as unacceptable in the twenty fourth century as it was in the nineteenth and much harder to get away with\nif thats so then there are opportunities awaiting you that are beyond anything you have ever imagined\nwhat is the matter\nprofessor i ask you to believe me when i say that we do not know how or why you are able to exist off the holodeck\naccording to the laws of physics this is impossible we would have no idea how to do it again\neven if i had reason to believe that would be successful i dont think that i could sanction it please understand professor that you are in essence a new life form one that we didnt intend to create and that we dont fully understand now the moral and ethical implications of deliberately creating another one like you are overwhelming\ni assure you we will do everything possible to make you comfortable\nagreed we dont have enough information about this phenomenon to act in a responsible way i think well hold off on professor moriarty s request for now but continue with your investigation in the meantime i have to deal with professor moriarty\ni feel i must postpone action until we learn more\nprofessor i wonder why you rein so much of a hurry is this woman involved with you in some illegal venture\nyou must love her very much\nthen her safety must be very important to you give us time to determine what is going on happened here that way we can minimise the risks in bringing her to you you wouldnt want to lose her because we acted too quickly\npicard here\non my way\nhow long until they begin to coalesce\nmister worf launch four class a probes toward the planets\nmister worf\nfor what reason\ncomputer route all command functions to the bridge\nre initialise them on my authorisation\nexplain\nwhats happening whos transferred the voice authorisation\nprofessor this situation is more serious than you realise in less than five hours those two planets will collide and a new star will form unless we move to a safe distance this vessel will be destroyed\nbut surely you wish to live like the rest of us\nweve discussed that we are studying means of bringing her safely off the holodeck but five hours is not enough time\nmister data will you investigate the possibility of complying with professor moriarty s request\nin the meantime we have a few things to discuss\nwell professor moriarty has agreed not to interfere with routine ship operations so long as he believes were acting in good faith then i dont think were in immediate danger any progress\nwell keep a titi have to tell him that we are making some progress mister laforge do you have any idea how moriarty could have gained control of the ship\ni want you to find some way to undo what he has done so that we can regain control of this ship\nyou wanted to see me\ncomputer route all command functions to this location\nre initialise them on my authorisation\npicard epsilon seven nine three\nhow do you know that\nmister data if what you say is true then this is not geordi laforge are you certain\ncomputer discontinue programme computer exit\npicard to bridge\nnumber one what is my present location\nno thank you picard out our comm badges must be locked into the simulation if that had been the real commander riker he would have given my location as holodeck three mister laforge will you excuse us please\nmister data who is real here\nand from that point we have been existing in a holodeck simulation created by professor moriarty\ni have just given the computer my command codes thinking i would get control of the ship\nsince professor moriarty never actually left the holodeck he may demand that commander riker help him to do so how long until the planetary collision\nso long as moriarty has control of the ship we are vulnerable somehow i have to find a way of giving him what he wants\ncomputer resume programme\ncaptain jean luc picard\nthank you no ive come here to prevail upon your intelligence and your insight\ncredit where credit is due madam i can see you are a woman not only of breeding but of wit and sagacity\nand do you suspect that that is my intent\nwhat does a woman like you see in a man like moriarty\nhes also an arch criminal\nso its your desire to leave the holodeck to be with him\nyes i can we have learned that if we uncouple the transporters heisenberg compensators and allow them to re scramble randomly we can be am a holodeck object or a person off the grid with all of the cohesion of conventional matter\nno please wait i have brought you this information because i think you are someone who will listen to a reasonable proposition someone whose mind is open to compromise\nmy ship is in danger it is imperative that i regain navigational control i want you to persuade professor moriarty to return the voice command to me ori will not modify the transporter\nnow once i have regained voice command i will transport you from the holodeck\ncountess you must understand

million subspace messages are going to end up drifting through space computer open uh nari correspondence file\nhello shian a sorry i havent talked to you in a while but ive been dealing with the new lieutenant rocha so far hes been rude arrogant and condescending and hes only been here two days this might be a long year\ni had the dream again mothers calling out my name shes somewhere in the house i get to the top of the hill all right but then the house is slanted im still walking uphill i cant find her doors everywhere and they all look the same\nhello shia na by the time you get this the bat a rael will be over this is the first time i havent been there ive been wondering who s singing the hora thin my place jomiaelhahnaliamamaroun italia rumaeltavarielfatradivaj omia eli had that dream again the one where mother is screaming i climb the hill to our house but i cant get to hersh iana this time iran away i was so scared iran back down the hill i think i know why ive been having the dreams about danger its because of whats been happening with that klingon hes getting more aggressive all the time not just the usual threat\nits because of whats been happening with that klingon hes getting more aggressive all the time not just the usual threat morag actually locked his disruptors to the station this time i dont think there ll be any trouble it just brings up those feelings of panic of wanting to run wanting to get away from danger shian a i couldnt say this to anyone but you but the panic its the same thing i used to feel whenever father got angry when i knew he was going to punish me only now im out here in space and theres no place to run\nshia na you always said id look great with a wig so here it is what do you think\nokay may be im getting a little crazy you would too if you were stuck on a relay station in the middle of nowhere with no one for company except an egomaniac like keith rocha i took a big risk today i countermanded an order he gave i agreed to handle the comm traffic for relay station one nine four while they shut down for maintenance rocha said we couldnt handle the additional signal load but i think he s wrong when he finds out hell be furious its days like this i wish i was home you know what i miss most musk an seed punch real musk an seed punch you can get it from the replicator but its not the same id give anything for some of the punch mother used to make with chunks of the seeds still in it keith is that you keith\nwe were running a level two diagnostic of the message buffer nothing special rocha had been on edge all morning but he d been irritable ever since he got there so i didnt think anything of it we were halfway through the procedure when suddenly he attacked me he grabbed me threw me against a bulkhead i yelled at him to stop but he wouldnt listen he took me by the throat i broke free and tried to get to the weapons locker im not sure what happened next but somehow i got aboard the shuttle and left\ni dont know sir may be i passed out im not even sure how long i was in the shuttle before the klingons picked me up\ni must have cut my head when he pushed me against the bulkhead\nno i didnt\ni dont remember exactly what happened to me after i was attacked im sorry its as if all my memories were drained out of me\nabsolutely not\nwho\nmaura come here girl come on maura\nyes its from cold moon over blackwater have you read it\nnot many people are nowadays oh your shoe\nmaura shame on you thats not like you what a naughty dog\nactually ive been stuck on that station for over nine months i wouldnt mind going some place with some activity\nthank you\nmmmm have you ever tried musk an seed punch\nyou have to be raised on it its very nutritious the taste grows on you\nyou speak hah lii an\nwe never travelled my family lived in the same house for five generations\nhow do you know about that\nall of it\nim sorry its just that i tell my sister things i wouldnt tell anyone else i guess i was feeling a little exposed\nespecially if i had seen you in that wig\nim curious now that youve met me ami what you expected\nin what way\nis that a personal question or part of a murder investigation\nkeith rocha was obnoxious from the minute he reported to duty he treated me as though i was beneath contempt i felt like i had to battle him to hold my own but i didnt want to see him dead\ni dont know\nhow much longer do you think the investigation will take\ni know im a suspect in the murder but let me ask you something youve watched my logs you know me better than anyone here doi seem like the kind of person who could murder someone\ni dont think i realised how much i needed to hear that\nyou called me complicated your e right i dont make friends easily oum riel\ni told you i dont remember what happened may be i did make to the weapons locker\nrocha and i had our disagreements but that does not mean i would kill him\nno nothing i suppose may be in self defence i\nyes i did\ni found a letter rocha was planning to send to starfleet command about me the letter said i had become belligerent and insubordinate he was going to ask for a formal hearing geordi i know how this looks\ni didnt kill him\ni was afraid if they found the letter they d blame me for the murder im not a model officer i realise that sometimes i act on impulse instead of thinking things through\ngetting out of here\nim scared geordi\nthen you believe me\ni havent been this close to someone in a long time i dont want to let go of it\nall right but first theres something i want to share with you a way that we can become more intimate my people are partially telepathic we use something called the can ar to help focus our thoughts we also use the can ar for a stronger emotional link during love\nlets find out\nthink of me\ngeordi\nyouve never been as close to someone as your e about to be think of me\nwhat are you saying\nthen maybe i did take the phaser\nso he turned on maura\ni guess ill be going to starbase two twelve for reassignment\nreally im sure the waiting list so long id be grey before i got here\nits an appealing offer but i think id rather get here on my own merits dont be surprised if you see my name on that list back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc copyright 1966 present the star trek web pages on

accessed\nthe logs have been deleted\nunknown captains log supplemental the qu vat has arrived with commander morag we are preparing to question him regarding his involvement in the murder of lieutenant rocha\ncommander morag is in his quarters lieutenant uh nari is not aboard the enterprise\nlieutenant uh nari transported to relay station forty seven at eighteen thirty hours\nwhats that noise\ncommander\ncellular residue i believe these are the remains of one of our lieutenants\nall of the blood traces i found match those of lieutenant aquieluhnariill assume those are her remains but ill need to take the deck plate back to sickbay just to be sure\nill have a better idea once ive analysed the deck plate\nthe stations shuttles gone maybe he took it\nthe cellular residue is completely fused with to metal of the deck plate were trying to micro vapor ise the metal in order to get a clear sample\nwell this is just a guess but from the molecular deposition on the plating id say it was a high level phaser blast\npossibly\nand theres still the question of what happened to lieutenant rocha\nwe presumed you were dead your bloodstains were found at the murder scene\ni cant confirm that until were able to separate the cellular residue from the deck plate i wont be able to do a clear scan\nall right initiate the resonance frequency burst crusher\nits an exact reproduction of my hand right down to the structure\nwhen i infused the matter with a resonance frequency burst it activated its dna then it touched my hand and it began to mimic my cellular structure\nthis is going to sound very far fetched but have you ever heard of a coalescent organism\ntheyre rare microscopic life forms which need to absorb other organisms in order to survive now that in itself is nt so unusual but coalescent s become the organisms theyve absorbed right down to the cellular level\nthere ve been reports that these organisms can exist on a larger scale certainly what happened to my hand seems to support that theory\nits possible that something happened to him before he reported for duty on the relay station\nive checked the records before he was posted to the relay station rocha served on an outpost in the tri on a system that is a remote sector maybe he was absorbed by a coalescent during that mission\nthe microscopic organisms have a cycle of no more than five to ten seconds we can only assume a larger more complex coalescent would have a cycle of day seven weeks\nright\ncommander morag we have discovered that the encrypted message bank on the station has been tampered with our analysis indicates that twenty seven priority starfleet messages are missing\nyour was also found on the message control module\ndo you have any idea what killed her\nso klingons did board the station\nhow could she read this stuff\nyou said you were trying to get to the weapons locker is there a possibility that you did\nyou still try to blame us\nanswer their questions\nthis is outrageous we will not tolerate these ridiculous accusations\nall right initiate the resonance frequency burst crusher\ni havent been this close to someone in a long time i dont want to let go of it\ndoctor you said that this was formed from the organic matter found in the deck plates\nthey must ve left an audio monitoring system on were hearing a few thousand subspace messages ill try and shut it off got it\ni dont know sounds like a loose panel or something i think its coming from this service duct over here\nhey pooch hey pooch come on out of there come on come on hey pooch what are you doing in there\nnot yet i cant get past these security lockouts and i think i know why all encrypted subspace messages are sent through this channel take a look at this signal notation\nlooks like somebody tried to bypass the access protocols and break into the coded messages it caused the security lockouts to freeze right up\ni wont know until i get into the files\nyeah\nim going to try accessing the logs from another console\nwhats going on here well we can start with re polarising the interface\nwhat is it pup whats the matter something over here this doesnt look like it belongs to you ah this what you want huh there you go computer run station logs in sequence\ncomputer access visual output\ncomputer access correspondence files lieutenant aqui el uh nari\ncome on lieutenant stick with me\nall right lets try this again come on this should be working the phase induct ers are aligned come on lieutenant i know your ein here somewhere computer me run a subsystem diagnostic with a frequency range often to one hundred megahertz\niced coffee\nwhat is it girl\nthere are three references to a commander moraga klingon officer who patrols this section of the border apparently he would pass the station every few days and harass them\ncould be she didnt say but i do have several more days of logs left to watch im hoping to learn more\ncomputer access the personal logsofaquieluhnari\nbegin playback\ndefinitely not you\nhow could she read this stuff\nive managed to access all of lieutenant uhn aris logs im still looking for lieutenant rochas whatever happened to the encrypted messages had a cascade effect on the whole storage system i cant find his files anywhere im running a level three diagnostic now\ni dont think so aqui el was the junior officer here\nlieutenant uh nari ive been up all night watching her personal logs i guess im starting to feel like i know her\nwell she was hah lii an she had one sister named shian as he drank musk an seed punch she had a quirky sense of humour she liked to sing she had questionable taste in literature\nforty six hours you ve been gone forty six hours\nyour logs said that a commander morag had been harassing you did you let him or any other klingon aboard the station\nlieutenant i know a friend of yours whos very eager to see you\ncome with me\nmaura thats the name\nim not much for gothic fiction\nyeah maura got a little restless\nits all right dont worry about it at least shes chewing them up in pairs ill arrange quarters for you im sure you want some time alone\ni know just the place\nyour e welcome\nyeah it nearly made me sick\nbat aral n alia\nwe travelled around quite a bit when i was growing up i picked up a couple of languages along the way\nthe one on the hill\nwell to be honest when we thought you were dead i needed to review your logs and personal correspondence for any possible clues about what happened\nmost of it yeah you need to understand that we thought you d been murdered we needed information\nid feel the same way\nit really wasnt you\nactually im not sure the woman is a win those logs is very complicated i think theres more to you than meets the eye lieutenant\nwell your relationship with lieutenant rocha for example he was only there for five days and yet there was evidence of plenty of friction you seemed to delight in doing things that you knew would upset him why take on extra comm traffic when you knew it was going to make him angry\ni dont know may be both\nwhy do you think he attacked you\nthree may be four days its tough to tell\nno you dont\nlook aqui el its been a rough couple of days i think you need some sleep\noum riel\nnow wait a minute we have nt even established this phaser is the murder weapon yet and even at levelten i dont see how it could have done the damage the medical evidence says it did a phase disruptor like a klingon weapon may be\nfine in the meantime id like to go back to the station and see if i can access rochas personal logs again\nand theres a lot about her that i do know and if she s innocent i want to help her prove it\nim not the one making judgements\ngot it computer display the personal records of lieutenant rocha from stardate s46455to46460\ncomputer what happened to the log entries for stardate 46459\nwho deleted them\nlast night after i dropped you off at your quarters you established a subspace link with this console you deleted some of rochas personal files didnt you\nwhy\nyeah it looks bad i find out that youve erased a letter that contained a possible motivation for murder\nthen explain this\naqui el this really complicates things\nwhat are you doing\naqui el running away isnt going to prove your innocence facing the situation will\nlook well get through this i promise you okay\nyes i do medical officers log supplement alive isolated the cellular residue from the deck plate but the has destabilised im attempting to reform it\nneither do i but ive got six hundred logs to go through\ni was wondering what that was for do both of us have to be telepathic for it to work\nlike this\ni can see you oh and i can feel you\nwhat are you doing commander\nwhat\nyeah right\nsure\nthanks\ncomputer display the engineering duty roster for the next three days\nmaura come on not now maura is aid not now come on give me a break here go lay down\nmaura\nmay be the reason you dont remember anything that happened after rocha attacked you is that the coalescing process had begun thank you remember when you said you felt like the memories had been drained right out of you thats probably exactly what was going on\nwhatever happened at least you got away before the process took hold\nright well what now\nyou know i had a talk with chief pendleton in communications there san opening for a level two specialist\ni could put in a good word\ni killed no one\nyes yes i was there my patrol route takes me near the station every six days three days ago i hailed them there was no response i was concerned\nyes i went aboard to see what had happened there was no one was there so i left\nthats all\nwhat of it\nthis is outrageous we will not tolerate these ridiculous accusations\nyes i did take the messages\nnoi killed no one there was no one there i took the codes but i killed no one\nwhat is this\ndo you have any idea what killed her\nthere hasnt been a klingon raid against the federation for more than seven years we can triska diplomatic incident until we have more evidence\nget rochas personnel file from starfleet command and ask starbase two twelve to help us find that shuttle\nkeep me apprised doctor\nperhaps this morag was the one who was interested in obtaining the encrypted messages\nvery well in the meantime ill speak with the klingon governor about commander morag\nim merely saying that im following upon evidence that my officers discovered on board\ngovernor to raki apologise i can see that you honestly didnt know what happened aboard the station i will just have to take this matter up with gowron im really sorry that we bothered you\nwell ordinarily he wouldnt but of course i was his arbiter of succession im sure that he will be happy to come here and investigate this matter you need nt worry about it any longer\noh yes so once again thankyou for your help ohi will be sure to mention your name to gowron when i speak to him\nthats very kind qap la\nenterprise to commander riker\nthe klingon ship qu vat has arrived with governor to rak please report to the observation lounge\ngovernor welcome aboard\nlieutenant why didnt you contact starfleet let them know what happened onboard the station\ngovernor we are merely exploring all the possibilities lieutenant uhn aris logs reported that commander morag had been harassing the station\nif he was only doing his job then im sure you wont mind if we spoke with him\nwhat did you found out about uh nari\nwhy\nyou think that she lied\nas of now we dont have sufficient evidence one way or the other i want you to examine her shuttle you might find something there which will shed some light on her story\ndid you kill lieutenant rocha\ngovernor we would like commander morag to remain on board the enterprise until this investigation is complete\ndoctor you said that this was formed from the organic matter found in the deck plates\ndoctor what exactly is this\nno\ndoctor if what your e saying is true then rocha attacked lieutenant uh nari to find a new body\ncomputer locate commander morag and lieutenant uh nari\ngeordi whats that\nheres your loose panel\nwhat is it\nit would take a powerful weapon to do that\nif that is uh nari wheres rocha\nbefore uh nari died or after\ndid you have any luck downloading the station logs\nits out of sequence\nare there any messages missing\nlooks like youve made a friend\nwere going to back to the ship let me know as soon as you have something\ncould it have been a klingon disruptor\ngeordi s found evidence that the encrypted messages have been tampered with and we are close to klingon space\naye sir\nso klingons did board the station\nhow sit going\nmay be rocha didnt make the official logs uh nari could have been responsible for them\naqui el\nwhat was she like\nriker here\nwere on our way\nyou said you were trying to get to the weapons locker is there a possibility that you did\nyour e sure\nrochas file is spotless two decorations for valour three outstanding evaluations from his previous commanders doesnt sound like the same man that lieutenant uh nari described\ni checked into her record too her last posting was onder i ben five i spoke to her commanding officer there he said she was argumentative quick to take offence he also told me he transferred her to that relay station because she was hampering their efforts to be honest im having trouble believing her story sir\ni sent worf to check the weapons locker on the relay station theresa phaser missing\nlied conveniently forgot im not sure i think its something we have to consider\naye sir\nwe found this type two phaser in your shuttlecraft it was taken from the weapons locker on the station\nit was set to levelten standard procedure requires that all phasers are set on level one when they rein storage\nhave you been able to remember anything that happened after he attacked you\ndoctor crusher tells me that in order to inflict the kind of molecular damage found in rochas remains it would take a sustained phaser discharge of at least thirty to forty seconds that doesnt sound like self defence to me\nlook were not here to make accusations were trying to find out what happened commander morag is due here in two hours lets see what he has to say\ngood idea\ngeordi wait a second thank you mister worf\nthis is off the record im saying this as a friend not your superior officer i think it would be best if you werent so personally involved with aqui el right now theres a lot about her we dont know\ni think youve let your personal feelings cloud your judgement\nwe found your on the bulkheads and the console we know you were there\nis that all\nso you think that rocha was killed by one of these organisms\nso what boarded the station could have been an organism that looked and acted like lieutenant rocha\nthat means uh nari is a coalescent\nyou get morag im going to the station\nstep away from him lieutenant\nthat may not be lieutenant uh nari\nstep away now medical officers log supplemental commander morag and lieutenant uh nari are being kept under close observation so far no sign of coalescent behaviour has surfaced\naqui el and morag will be transferred to a secure medical facility at starbase twelve may be well know more by the time we get there\nit could be morag we dont know for sure\nget some rest youve had a rough couple of days\nare you saying we attacked your outpost\nevidence so you are making an accusation the klingon empire will not stand for these kinds of lies\ngowron wont bother with such a minor incident\ngowron will come here\ni will investigate this further picard you need not bother gowron with this matter\nqap la\ndo not bore me with your human pleasantries i told you we did not kill the woman now i will prove it to yough os\nthis is lieutenant aqui el uh nari\nwe found her on our side of the border heading toward sector two five two zero she is lucky my patrol ship did not destroy her vessel on sight\nyou still try to blame us\nat least i do not wear the uniform of the ptak\nhe was doing his job\nvery well in the interests of diplomacy i will allow you to speak to morag but my patience has limits\nanswer their questions\nthis is a diplomatic matter morag do not make me search your ship\ntake him\nconcerned\ncommander the shuttlecraft is gone there is no one on board\nwere ready commander\ncommander there are traces here klingon\nyes but i only found from one klingon so far i will continue to scan\ngovernor to rak sir\nthen the remains we found must be those of lieutenant rocha\nif that is true then morag or some other klingon must have boarded the station after she left we found traces of klingon on the station\nhave the courage to admit your mistakes or are you a lobe vos\ncommander it is set to kill\nthat means that someone deliberately changed the setting and then there is the matter of your conflict with lieutenant rocha\naye sir\nthis way\ndo you think this is what happened with your hand\ni do not understand\nhow often do they have to change bodies\nthere was one other person on the station morag it is possible he was the one who was absorbed\nwhere did she go\naye sir\ndo not move\nyou will come with me",
    "episode 138": "commander we are glad to see you we are prepared to transfer your cargo as agreed\nour arrangements were made with major rak al you may rest assured your cargo will be taken safely to its destination we will transmit coordinates for you to be amita board\nhe risked his life together e he spent two weeks alone in a scout ship\nwell maybe he finally realised he made a mistake\nthat about does it how does it feel to have your own face back\nthere is no sign of the freighter sir we are the only ship in the area\nsensors indicate no other ships within three light years\nit appears to be the remains of a ship my analysis indicates that it was an antares class freighter\ni do not believe so sir that would not be consistent with the debris pattern however sensors indicate extremely high levels of residual antiprotons\ncorrect based on the antiproton decay i would estimate the incident occurred within the last four point three hours\nsensors are picking up a polarised magnetic distortion to our portside\nthe distortion is extremely weak sir it appears to be moving slowly it is gone sir\nthe distortion no longer registers on our instruments\nunknown sir our understanding of romulan technology is still limited\nthe distortion has reappeared sir bearing three three seven mark ten it has disappeared again sir\nit has disappeared once again siri believe it may have been coming to a halt\nsir the magnetic distortion has reappeared\nit appears to be moving toward us closing slowly its bearing indicates a possible collision course\ni am unable to make a precise measurement however i would estimate impact within ninety seconds\ntime to impact approximately sixty seconds\ni understand\nyes sir commander i must speak with captain picard\nplease its important urgent\ncommander\nof course im sorry sir\nyes captain i have a message from ambassador spock he said it involves further cowboy diplomacy he said you would understand there sac or vallen freighter arriving in the kaleb sector in the next twelve hours spock wants you to rendezvous with that ship bring its cargo back to federation space\nhe said it was important to the future of the romulans and the federation\npartly\ni was ready to come back romulus had lost its appeal\nthe romulans are very moral captain they have an absolute certainty about what is right and what is wrong who is a friend and who is an enemy a strict moral compass which provides them with a clarity of purpose at one time i found their sense of purpose their passion and commitment to be very compelling\nas ive grown older i realise that clarity of purpose is a more ambiguous matter than i had thought in my youth\ni dont understand\nnoi was told the ship would be at these coordinates\nyes well not exactly\nsomeone else relayed the message to me but he said spock spoke directly to him i trust the man who spoke to me he would not have lied\nyes hes a member of the underground a dissident he risks his life to work with those who want a different future for romulus\nno that is not so\nthe freighter is an old antares class vessel with limited speed and range it couldnt have taken on its cargo more than a day ago which means it must be within fifteen light years of here\nit didnt seem necessary and on romulus you learn not to volunteer information its a hard habit to break\nthats the ship we were supposed to meet\nn osiris wear it\ncaptain romulan ships use a forced quantum singularity as a power source if that system is not functioning perfectly or is damaged even slightly it might show through the cloak as a magnetic disturbance of some kind\nits a strong possibility sir\ni dont think so sir a romulan commanders instinct would be to attack\ni dont know sir the romulans will sometimes make suicide attacks but only as a last resort theres no reason for it here\nthis is proconsul mret and his aides theyre part of the underground movement\ncounsellor are you all right\nlets get you to sickbay\nwere holding at the coordinates specified by ensign des eve sir\naye sir\naye sir\naye sir\naye sir\ngood your e awake\nplease counsellor there is little time the commander will be calling for you at any moment\nyou are aboard the imperial romulan warbird khazar a i am sub commander n vek\nit was necessary i could not be certain you would come voluntarily\nthere are drugs in your system but they ve nearly dissipated the disorientation will soon pass\nlisten to me carefully you are no longer deanna troi you are major rak al of the tals hiar the imperial intelligence commander to re th\nthere is no time to explain everything you must listen commander to re th will want to know your mission tell her nothing simply instruct her to proceed to the kaleb sector heading one oh two mark four\nrepeat it heading one oh two mark four\nyou are an officer of the tals hiar she will obey you but do not push her too far\nyes commander immediately please we must hurry\nyou are a starfleet officer disguised as a romulan unless you trust me and do exactly as i have said to re th will discover you and you will be killed\nyour only chance to get off this ship alive is to do as i say you are an empath you would know if i am lying ami\nthen let us go see the commander\ncommander may i present major rak al of the tals hiar this is commander to re th\nthe purpose of the tals hiar is to ensure loyalty to defy them is to invite imprisonment or death\nthat is why i called you here these are the cargo containers we brought on board earlier\nvice proconsul mret of the imperial senate and his two top aides\nhis defection will be a profound blow to romulus\nmret had questioned the repressive activities of the government and was in danger of being imprisoned he is willing to take this risk in order to protest romulan policy and support the dissident movement\nyes if we are able to deliver mret safely spock is hopeful that we can establish an escape route for the thousands of dissidents who live in fear of their lives now you realise why we are willing to go to such extraordinary length seven kidnapping you to make sure we succeed\nthere was she was killed so that you could take her place only a member of the tals hiar would have the authority to alter a ships mission\nyes for the first part of the plan but if anything goes wrong we will need a starfleet officer\ntheres no need to go into that unless it becomes necessary for your own sake counsellor the less you know about the specifics of this plan the better\nwhen we reach the kaleb sector we will rendezvous with a cor vallen freighter you will take these containers into their ship and accompany them back to starfleet headquarters\nno they were hired simply to take you to federation space\nwe are due in the wardroom shortly the senior officers always dine together\nno you will be expected to attend ill go ahead follow me after a few moments commander to re th must not feel that anything is unusual\nare you certain\ni beg forgiveness commander but major rak al ordered me to fire\nour plan has collapsed\nthere was no alternative you told me they couldnt be trusted if i let them live the whole mission would be in jeopardy\ndont lecture me counsellor a number of people have died in order to carry out this mission believe me those eighteen wont be the last\nfine ago nise all you want but dont let it get in the way of our plan\nyou remember i told you if anything went wrong we would need a starfleet officer there is a starfleet base on draken four it is two days away at maximum warp thats where were going\nyes its your job to order to reth to proceed into federation territory\nwe will if you provide the correct access codes\nif you have another idea ill be happy to consider it\nit is not wise to challenge the tals hiar commander\nthats impossible\ncounsellor this ship is travelling under cloak all of our electromagnetic emissions are being monitored any attempt at communication whatsoever and we would be discovered instantly it could not succeed we must continue to draken four that is the safest course\ntrack usno we want to get into federation territory undetected\nif there were i wouldnt do it\ncounsellor\nthere is one possibility in order for a ship to remain undetectable while cloaked the radiative emissions from the warp engines must be precisely balanced the ships engineer is a sympathiser he may be able to slightly mis align one of the nullifier cores it would create a small magnetic disturbance in space whenever we were in motion\nthe effect would only be intermittently they might not even detect it\nanything more would be immediately registered on the bridge even this slight misalignment may be detected\ncommander the enterprise may simply be engaged in search operations\nsir disruptors are standing by ready to disengage cloak\nall sections report ready for battle commander\ncommander please step down\ntheir shields are dropping\nyes major firing\ni am reading a malfunction in our forward disruptor array the power system has destabilised\nat ease its captain actually\nyou said it was important that i see you\nwhat kind of cargo\nyou have returned in order to give me this message\nin order to know whether ambassador spock s message is being delivered accurately i need to understand something about the messenger\nyet at one time you found something very appealing about it\nbut not anymore\ncommander riker set course for the kaleb sector warp factor eight\nensign verify our position\nits one possibility mister worf bring ensign des eve to my ready room\nensign des eve you promised me a freighter with an important cargo the only thing here is empty space do you have an explanation\nyou said that the message came directly from ambassador spock\nwhat does that mean\nit would be risky to set a trap here so close to federation space but the fact remains here we are there is no freighter did your contact tell you anything else that might be helpful\nwhy didnt you mention this earlier\nwell maybe now would be a good time to start follow me gentlemen\ncould there have had some sort of malfunction are actor core breach\nthen the romulans could still be in the vicinity\nwhatever that freighter was carrying they certainly didnt want it to reach us are you sure you dont know what it was\nall we have here are questions mister data continue with your scan\nanalysis\ncould this distortion be caused by a cloaked ship\nmister des eve in your opinion is it possible that were picking up a cloaked romulan ship\nmister data continue your scan ensign link navigational control to mister data s console and plot a course for that distortion\nwhere is it now mister data\nstop

seven minutes\ncommander the enterprise is underway\ntheyre heading for us sir\nthey appear to be on an intercept course\ncloaking device functioning correctly sir all shipboard emissions within normal range\nyes commander\nthey are moving away commander\ndisruptors fully charged\ndisruptors were ineffective the enterprise was not damaged they have reestablished full shields\nthe transporter

under arrest for treason\nafter doctor crusher declares you medically fit you will be confined to your quarters until a court martial can be convened find some civilian clothes i dont want to see you in that uniform\nhes a busy man\nill tell him\naye aye sir\nanything on long range sensors\ncould this have been a hoax\nromulan disruptor fire\nred alert shields at maximum\ngone\nif this is a romulan ship will it stay in position until we leave\ntime to impact\nit doesnt make any sense why would they run into us and if they were why wouldnt they do it at full speed\nwhats she doing on that ship\ntheyre in stasis medical team to the bridge\nwheres deanna\nsub commander n vek we are approaching the loading point bring our guest to the bridge\ncommence loading the cargo notify me when the transfer is complete\nattend to your station why are you here without your guards well\nand exactly what is the nature of this clandestine assignment\noh why not\nyou dont act like a member of the tals hiar how long have you been with intelligence\nah\ntell me is there a reason why the commander of a ship is being kept ignorant of its cargo\ni have been ordered to take on cargo but its contents are unknown to me does that seem wise i am responsible for the safety of this ship and its crew how do i know this cargo is safe to transport\nah the tals hiar is deeply concerned for the safety and wellbeing of the military im sure that every person on the bridge of this ship could offer testimony about personal experiences with the tals hiar but i doubt that many could recall those encounters as tender and caring so i must ask you to forgive me major if i hesitate to accept your assurances that that cargo presents no danger to my crew i intend to open those containers\non whose authority\nwhy should we go to the kaleb sector its virtually deserted\npilot set course bearing one oh two mark four warp six\nwed been told that the klingon outpost was undefended so when their warships de cloaked they took us completely by surprise\nthe klingons managed to destroyed half my squadron before we even opened fire but when we did ha they were no match for us i destroyed their flagship myself i received the sota ric citation for my actions that day the intelligence officer in charge of that mission was executed major welcome to our table\ni suggest you try the vii nerine its quite good\ni realise that its nothing compared to what your e accustomed to on romulus but you could at least try the vii nerine\nno doubt tell me major where did you train the intelligence academy or the imperial war college\noh so you must know commander kons ab\ni assume you studied military history with him\ntell me major what do you think about his theories on the differences between the military and the tals hiar\ncome now major surely you attended his classes regularly it was kons abs main theme\ncommander kons ab believes that in order to function military officers have to trust each other theta ls hiar on the other hand trust no one they expect deception so they always find it\ni hope so\nprotection from what how was the empire threatened by the words of an old man a devoted citizen who merely tried to speak his mind how did the tals hiar protect the empire by dragging him my father out of his home in the middle of the night\nno he was just an idealistic old man i never saw him again\nand thats all you have\nwhat is the configuration\nvisual\nwith whom do you have this agreement\nwhy did you destroy that vessel\ni demand an explanation\ni dont care if there were eighteen or eight hundred on this ship i give the command to fire major you have no right\neven you eventually will have to answer to someone you will be held accountable\ni will nonetheless make an entry in my log that i am not responsible for those eighteen lives and that i deplore their loss\nand what are my orders now major\nyou cant be serious\nwe must\nin order to reach draken we will have to travel through federation space for nearly twenty hours\ncontrary to the propaganda that your superiors would have us believe starfleet is neither weak nor foolish the chances of us reaching draken undetected are not good\nthe cloaking device does not always make us invulnerable and you would know that if you had spent anytime at all in the field the federation has littered its borders with subspace listening posts with gravi tic sensors they may even have a tachyon detection grid in operation in which case they will know that were there if we are discovered in federation territory it will be interpreted as an act of war\nthat will be no guarantee that we will escape undetected\npeople blame the military for the wars that we are asked to fight but i think it is your kind major that will be the death of us all\nplot a course for the draken system\nprepare for warp\nactivate viewscreen enlarge\nwell major it appears your suspicions about that freighter were correct after all the federation has come in search of its spies status\nthey were nt expecting to find us here and i see no reason to alter that perception the radiation from the debris field could make our cloak detectable if we engage warp engines proceed at manoeuvring speed\neven if we are detected they can not track us once we go to warp\ntheir intentions are obvious major and are of no concern to us proceed on course manoeuvring engines only go to warp when were clear of the debris field\ni will not let her tell me how to run my ship\ngood what is their course\nwhat\nwhat is the status of our cloaking device is there a malfunction of any kind\nmaintain full sensor scans\nperhaps\nengage manoeuvring engines forward zero point one take us directly under their hull\nit seems that the enterprise can track us even though we are cloaked i intend to find out whether they can or can not n vek ready attack procedure\nconsidering the nature of our mission i would have preferred to have avoided it as well but i see no other alternative\nwe will pass as close as we possibly can if they do have the ability to track us they will move to avoid a collision if they doi will destroy them\nprepare attack sequence\ndisengage cloak on my command prepare to fire\nwhat\ni do not need your authorisation to attack major this is my ship\nthe enterprise has demonstrated that they can track us they must be destroyed\nare you questioning my ability to command\ndo you think anyone here will listen to you\nyou relying the disruptor beam has been purposely sabotaged to conceal a transporter beam within quickly pilot locate transport coordinates what have you done\nso major the mysterious cargo brought on board by major rak al of the tals hiar has been transported to the starfleet vessel i see two traitors in our midst\nso major now that you can no longer take refuge behind the shield of the tals hiar its time to answer a few questions what was in those cargo containers well no matter we will soon know all we need to know and then we will execute you pilot drop shields and cloak the ship prepare to go to warp\ncomputer lights computer turn on the lights\nwho are you\nwhereami\nwarbird i was at the neuropsychology seminar at bo kara six the last thing i remember was returning to my quarters i was attacked i felt a hypo spray\noh god my heads still spinning\nwhy have you brought me here\nami a prisoner\nthe kaleb sector\nheading one oh two mark four and shell take orders from me\nim not going anywhere until you tell me whats going on\nhow do i know i wont be killed anyway\nno\nthe mission is one of utmost secrecy i could not risk bringing guards\ni can not reveal that\ni am under orders\nseveral months\ni dont know what you mean\nim sure it is safe otherwise it would not have been loaded\nthat cargo is the property of the tals hiar you will not touch it\nmine and if you do not wish to undergo another personal experience with the tal shia ri suggest you not question me again now proceed on course bearing one oh two mark four to the kaleb sector\nbecause those are your orders\nyou may wait outside make certain were not disturbed\ntheyre terrified of me\ni think its time you told me what this is all about\nwhats in it\nhesa live in stasis who is it\nmre the s one of the highest ranking members of the romulan government\nwhy is he doing this\nyour e part of ambassador spock s underground movement\nyouve given me the identity of a tals hiar officer is there a real major rak al\nwhy me you could have found a romulan to play this role\nwhy\nwhat is your plan\nthe cor val lens are mercenaries do they know whats in these containers\nvery well\nill go to my quarters i think it would be best if i stayed out of the way of the commander\ncommander\nive smelled better vii nerine on prison ships\nthe academy\ni know of him\nyes\nwhich aspects are you referring to\ndo you have a point to make commander if so it has escaped me\nyour opinion of the tals hiar quite clear commander\nwe ensure the loyalty of the people do you believe the empire would be better off without our protection\nclearly your father was a traitor\ni dont need your devotion commander just your obedience\nhail them\nhes lying they have no intention of keeping their word\nyes\nhow many people were on that ship\nthis gives me the right\ni have been given broad discretionary powers sub commander n vek acted under my authority the authority of the tal shi arias sure you this action will not be questioned\ndo what you feel is necessary in the meantime we must protect ourselves engage the cloaking device\nhold position and wait\nour plan what about the people on that freighter why did you fire\neighteen people lost their lives\nim sorry but i cant dismiss those lives so easily\nyou dont have a plan anymore\nin a romulan ship\nwell never get through the gravi tic sensor nets\ndo you really think this has a chance of succeeding\nyou will plot a course for the draken system\ndraken four was the freighters destination i ordered the freighter destroyed because i recognised the captain a known federation spy now we must deliver the cargo ourselves\ni do not intend to explain myself to you you will set a course\nthat is not a problem\nwe will be cloaked\nthe tals hiar has obtained access codes for the sensor nets i will provide them if necessary\nyour cowardice does not be fit a romulan soldier\none moment commander we should hold our position until the enterprise has left the area we can not risk detection\nwe have not established their intentions\nyou will keep me informed of our progress\nwe have to get a message to the enterprise\nits the perfect opportunity the enterprise is nearby if we can communicate with them they might be able to help us\nis there anything you can do to the ship or to the cloaking device that would let the enterprise track us\nwhat we want is to get the dissidents to safety now answer the question is there away\nyes you will\nwere not playing it your way anymore n vek ive been kidnapped surgically altered put in danger ive gone along with all your plans now you are going to listen to me you find a way to let the enterprise track us ori will go to tore th and tell her ive discovered your e a traitor ill order you ejected into space is that clear sub commander\ngood do it\nif its the best we can do we have to try it\nits a risk we have to take your e the one who outlined the stakes to men vek are you getting squeamish now just because things are getting a little more dangerous\nwhat are you doing\nwe can not risk an engagement here\nwhat do you intend to do\ndisregard that order\ni do not authorise this attack you will cease battle operations immediately\nhow typical of the military to resort to brute force when discretion is required\nyes they can track us so if we attack them they will return fire and since we have no shields when were cloaked they will destroy us\nyou are not fit to command step down step down ori will have you removed\nif any one of you defies the tals hiar you will not bear the punishment alone your families all of them will be there beside you i am now commander of this ship you will take orders from me and no one else remove commander to re th from her station if she resists shoot her\nremove her weapon\nnow commander watch and learn in order to defeat your enemy you must first understand them the federation wishes to avoid war at all costs oi shall offer them a diplomatic solution get them to lower their shields and then destroy them\ni am major rak al of the tals hiar\nhow can we be of help\na regrettable incident captain the freighter was fired upon by the former commander of this vessel i have now taken control and i assure you there will be no more attacks\ncaptain we do not want to exaggerate this incident you and i can discuss it calmly we can diffuse it before it becomes inflated\ni will come onto your ship please lower your shields and prepare to beam me a board\nthank you\nactivate forward disruptor array fire when ready\nyes\njust right thank you\nthe thanks should got on vek he sacrificed himself to save them and me\nthe man acted dis honourably he is a traitor\nthat does not excuse his original actions\naye sir\ncaptain he has deceived us\nwas hea romulan\ncaptain he could

the bottle or whatever it was and damn everything did you think about me at all\nbut you never asked if i wanted it its just like you mark to assume that what you felt was right was the only answer\nlet me go\nour anniversary is next week our fiftieth\nbut he s getting younger and im well look at me why did he do this\nwhat about our lives his and mine i was looking forward to time

should never have walked again\nyes sir\ni found traces of chemical substances in his blood and tissue samples but none of them are in our pharmacopoeia im still working on alien references to substances like these alli can tell you is that he s ingested something thats strongly affecting his body\ncaptain there are so many things going on icant give you specifics until i do a lot more tests\nhis red cell count is running riot the cellular structure of his body is radically changing but we cant make any decisions on that until we know what its changing to his is skewed dont ask me how but he even looks younger and captain there are absolutely no traces of iverson s disease\nnone that we know of but whatever these substances are doing to his body at least theyve done that for

that does not correspond with the information in my tricorder sir\ncaptain the admiral is definitely incorrect the tunnel schematics we have show this to be a dead end it was sealed off two years ago\ntheir phasers sir set on kill\nno sign of a wound\nyou said there is no cure for iverson s\nmessage coming in from mord an sir\nlets see it captain\nforty years of civil war captain\nforty five years ago i negotiated a hostage situation on mord an captain karn as was a young man then but so was i he seems to feel that i can handle the situation again\nmy wife and i will be am aboard at fifteen hundred hours captain acknowledge\nmy wife anne captain there are certain details of this mission that you should understand before we begin\ni am not simply an advisor on any assignment i accompany starfleet has designated me senior mission officer i control the away team and all its actions is that understood of course captain you command the ship but the mission is mine i trust you are incomplete agreement\nit seldom is karn as however we could save a good deal of it now if you ll outline the terrorists demands\ntell them i accept the conditions of negotiation\nwrong number one he told me that the terrorists are desperate enough to kill if they re crossed they are willing to talk one on one but not to him\npossible but i suspect its closer to the mark if we said he doesnt want to admit failure of his own efforts to negotiate he is a proudman\nready for what captain\nstill alive you mean\nquite right commander but i am not andi imagine ambassador hawkins has told him that i briefed the ambassador about mord an before he left to take up residence\ni have negotiated many treaties on many planets picard ive found that peace or the appearance of it is often a prelude to war\nthey may i am suggesting karn as is the last man to give them such weapons\ni know karna she is a warrior he lives for challenge these people have insulted his honour by taking the embassy staff hostage ill negotiate but ill have to be very careful in dealing with karna shell want revenge for that insult\ndidnt want to feels good to be on one again\nim fine i feel like a kid again\nno theres no need its happened before\nitll pass just give me a moment see im better its going away\njust body changes last checkup they said id have to expect it\nim sure\nthank you captain i would\nneglected to mention i began some new therapy before i left seems to be working i havent felt this good since the last time i was in space the gettysburg all i needed to get me out of that chair was the thought of walking the decks in command of a starship again\na figure of speech of course shes your ship ill just keep an eye on her for awhile\nits the new therapy im taking its working annie\ni told you i just needed to get back into space again\nits the new treatment\ni hope your e heading for the bedroom\nyour e flatter me\ni dont know\nask away theres nothing to hide now\nive planned this for a long time ever since i learned i had iverson s disease since it put me in that chair\ntheresa planet in the cerebus system cerebus two they say the natives have a process that rejuvenates the body gives you your youth back\nits true picard im living proof oh its dangerous the mortality rate is high and its very painful aliens are seldom allowed to obtain the process but i managed iti negotiated a treaty for cerebus two some years ago and they felt obligated to honour my request for the process\nthe herb and drug combinations are self administered slowly over a period of two years every response is different depending on a beings dna i got enough for both of us annie but i had to test it on myself first i couldnt risk you if i died well i was half a man so what did it matter\nbut i was starting to change anne it was almost undetectable but the improvement was there then when this hostage situation came up i knew id have to be at my peak to deal with it i didnt have time to wait for the drug to work naturally\ni took both of them and look at me annie look at me im strong im alert fit im fitter than you are picard and im getting younger\nannie i did it for us\ni obtained enough of the dosage for both of us\nbut it was the right answer for me it was killing you having to take care of an invalid annie what good was ito you we can be together again\ni can get you another supply of the drug\ncommander data i wish to open a communication frequency to karn as\nkarn as must have tried to negotiate with the terrorists before he was forced to call on me i want all the information he has access to\nim the negotiator picard\nkarn as will have to cooperate with me and the terrorists and damn his sensitivities\na sensible precaution picard make it so\nkarn as\nwere on a secured channel karn as you can talk freely whos behind this thing you said dissidents\nthen who is it ardan gil nor\ni almost died a couple of times on missions but i always made it through somehow\nyouve never for given me\nthere are no dissidents are there no terrorists you have the hostages\nwhat if i refuse\nconn are we still on schedule to arrive at mor dan in thirty eight hours\npicardi want a jump to warp eight so that we arrive ahead of our announced etait ll throw karn as off balance and we can catch him before he s ready\ni believe karn as has the hostages and there never were any dissidents\nim not at liberty to say picard but negotiations are no longer the answer\nand you agree with that too riker\ngood because i plan to personally lead an away team on an armed rescue mission to get them out of there\ncommander data bring up the plans i requested on the viewscreen please\nmost of mor dans principal city was devastated during the war what was left consisted largely of a network of underground tunnels a rats maze when they rebuilt the city they simply built over the tunnels\nthis is where karn as held his hostages before and where i believe he has them now\nkarn as is a dogged strategist picard not a brilliant one he sticks to what works he will kill the hostages if we do not get them out of there\nyou dont agree\nstarfleet has given me command of the away teampicard and i intend to use the masi see fit\nwell be atm or dan in three hours\ni never could before a mission i always wound up in the observation lounge staring out at the stars thinking\ni want to save lives captain\ndo you know the background them or dan ites had some sophistication but were still ruled by tribal family units karn ass father was the ruling chief of one of the families another tribe had him assassinated karn as seized the passengers of a starliner and held them hostage demanding that starfleet provide him with weapons that would enable him to defeat his rivals\nofficially the story is that after two other mediators were murdered i went in and negotiated with karn as to bring out the hostages safely\nit wasnt my golden oratory that saved them captain i gave karn as the weapons he wanted\ni gave exactly the same weapons to his rivals my interpretation of the prime directive let them solve their problems with those arms on an equal basis\ni didnt know that would happen i thought a minor war it would be settled in less than a year how would i know it would take four decades but i falsified the reports to starfleet and i lived with that on my soul picard sixty three people came away safe but millions died on mord an because i delivered those weapons\nbut i started itil it the match now finally i can vindicate myself if only in a small way i came to negotiate but that isnt what karn as wants\nand im not going to give it to him picard im going to do what i should have done the first time were taking the hostages out by force if necessary no deals\nprepare to energise chief\ni will remind you one more time picardi am the senior mission commander and im leading this team\nyes perfect we are in the m4 tunnel directly under the governors residence m4 is a subsidiary tunnel but it crosses and links with several main ones\nyour information is incorrect commander i know these tunnels like the back of my own hand keep scanning for signs of human life forms karn as held his hostages in these tunnels before hell do it again\ndamn\nthis is the most direct route set phasers to cut through it\nkarn as may not have them in the same place theres no substitute lieutenant for personal reconnoitre\npicard picardi have to get to karn as\nits my last option picard the raid failed all i have left to bargain with is myself\nlet me go if i give myself over to him hell let the hostages go its me he wants\nmy life for how many hostages picard twenty let me go\nper et or karn as you always were a stubborn man i thought you wanted me im here release the hostages now\nper et or karn as there were only two of us in the meeting you didnt even trust your lieutenants there you told me that old pere to rsa in had ordered your fathers assassination you told me that you wanted arms to destroy him peace wasnt on your mind all you wanted was revenge and i gave you the weapons to do it\nthere the blood cut you gave me to seal our bargain\nyes\nannie with the golden hair\ni see only the gold\ni am karn as governor of mord an four a dissident group of terrorists have taken federation ambassador hawkins and his staff hostage they will not discuss terms with me this is a crisis i can not resolve the terrorists are demanding a federation negotiator i feel there is only one negotiator with the skills to resolve the situation the lives of the hostages will depend on starfleet delivering this man tom or dan commander mark jameson admiral jameson the terrorists have given you six earth days to bring him here or the hostages will die\nmord an four to enterprise this is karna si will speak to the captain\nis admiral jameson on board\nso jameson i see time has not been kind\nthey insist all discussions will take place here on mord an they refuse to speak to me only to a federation mediator they say they will brook no excuses if there are any offered your ambassador and his people will die unpleasantly i believe them so should you admiral\ni will do so immediately\nthe terrorists have given you six earth days to bring him here or the hostages will die\nwhat is it you want admiral\nyes political opponents who feel the federation will disavow me as governor if they stir up enough trouble on mord an\ntheyre dead jameson a long time now for a long time i thought you were dead too\nyes now youre coming back to mord an to negotiate for hostages again its almost as though the forty five years in between never happened\nof course i have it was years ago\nand if i have your e coming to mord an jameson and your e going to negotiate for their lives and im going to ask a very very high price\nthen the hostages will die youve seen how my executioners work they are still as efficient as they were perhaps even more skilled now youll come even if you dont have much honour left\nenterprise there has been an armed intrusion in the tunnels beneath the city that smells of jameson where is he\nthat is not my concern sick or well you have ten minutes to be am him down\nwho are you i want jameson\nthis charade will accomplish nothing picard beam down jameson and the hostages will be freed continue this and i promise you they will die and you with them\nper et or was my old title why do you call me that i warn you picard this trick is going too far he has been coached for some devious reason if this farce does not stopped immediately you and the hostages will be put to death\ni am waiting for an explanation captain\nthis story you are telling is unbelievable jameson is a man of more than eighty years not this i want that old man picardi want to show him this world he helped to make the scars on old soldiers bodies the graveyards of our young dead the wasted cities we are still rebuilding and all of it caused by him\nbut jameson didnt give weapons to only us if he had we would have quickly triumphed over our enemies and there would have been peace in all these decades i want him to pay for that picard\nyour e wasting my time picard\nyes\nyes\nthis is the man i want\njameson has to pay for his crimes i have sworn it to my people\nno i dont believe you youre shielding jameson on the ship and your e telling me this tale to save his life\njameson told you this if it is you show me the scar\nit is you somehow it is you then die by your own weapon no no my revenge will be in seeing you live like this such pain\nrest jameson your long night and mine are over the hostages will be freed immediately captain im prepared to be cooperative\naye sir were at

more about the terrorists than hes prepared to admit\nin a few moments doctor\njust a routine medical checkup ships regulations\nall right karn as has a problem he thinks you can resolve what do the terrorists need that karn as cantor wont give them\nexcellent doctor\nhe is eighty five years old doctor for some the memory begins to fail\nthat is an observation id expect from counsellor troi doctor doctor i do respect your opinion and ill want you on the bridge for the next day or so the admiral must remain in the best of health for these negotiations and he might require your services\nadmiral were approaching the id ini star cluster would you like to take the conn as we make transit\nwell admiral quite a little surprise youve pulled on us\nadmiral you only have the conn temporarily\nthe admiral displayed a remarkable improvement out there wouldnt you say\nthen how do you account for it\ni want you to look into it doctor thoroughly\nspecifics doctor\ngive me what you have now\nyou said there is no cure for iverson s\nget me some answers doctor as soon as possible\nmrs jameson i have to ask the admiral some questions\nadmiral in addition to your rank you are a particularly valuable commodity just now starfleet has a right to some answers\nyes ive heard of that story its a myth\nobviously it works very rapidly but how does it work\nso you took the whole dose\nthe only question i have admiral is why you thought it necessary to be young to negotiate the release of the hostages even willing to put your life at risk for it ill be on the bridge admiral if you want to talk further\none moment mister data admiral this is picard may i know the reason for this communication\nyou said karn as was a proudman admiral probably sensitive about his failure to deal with this situation is it wise to press him on this\nthen i suggest a secured channel admiral\nmake it so\nready for exactly what admiral\nwhat has happened to bring you to that conclusion that s quite a big jump\nisnt the most important thing the hostages lives\nwouldnt that be a little obvious admiral\ntherefore you see this armed raid as the only option\nwith respect admiral i would point out no one else has heard or considered karn ass demands the federation might view them differently if they knew what they were\ni couldnt sleep either\nperhaps in this case rethinking\nwhy is this mission so important to you why did you risk your life to lead it personally\nnoble sentiments but thats too easy an answer you ve been here before you negotiated a release of the hostages with karn as before why is it now your answer is an armed raid its my away team your e sending in there i think there s something your e not telling me and i have a right to know what it is\nthats the official record\nare you saying thats not the truth\nyou did what\nand that decision plunged them into forty years of civil war\nkarn as could have worked for peace during those years instead of continuing the war its not all on your head admiral\nrevenge thats why he demanded you when he knew that you were still alive\nbelay that admiral your proper place is on the bridge\nthe admiral is correct number one he has that right but i am the captain of this ship and i have a right to accompany him riker youre in command of the enterprise energise\nno doubt your e right mister data however forty five years

admiral karn as before he left on this mission he administered an overdose of an alien de aging drug to himself he wanted to face you with strength again on even terms this is what the drug has done to him\nas i understand it karn as you were the one who demanded the weapons to avenge your fathers death\nenterprise this is picard have mrs jameson prepare to be am down karna si asked doctor crusher to bring with her the visual records weve made of admiral jameson s deterioration will you look at them\njust a few moments you saw the admiral on the enterprise when he was en route to mord an\nand you recognised him\nis this them an you saw\nhes here karn as look once he took the compound there was no way to stop it\nyoull have to deal with me karn as whatever you wanted from jameson isnt possible anymore and you wanted revenge you blamed your war on him and theres no doubt he had a lot to do with it but you had the weapons and you used them you could have tried for negotiations for peace on your planet long ago instead you chose to fight how many of those forty years of civil war are on your head karn as\nforty five years ago he made the wrong decision he wanted to come here

powerful vision\nyou must find its meaning if it has anything to do with your father you must learn all you can about it in the klingon maj q a ritual there is nothing more important than receiving a

not stop until you have the answer\nyes i wish to go to the romulan prison camp\nno you will take me there\ni checked the station records you have a vessel that is capable of warp speed\nwhat is the

test\ncome i will take you on the hunt\ni think they will\nthe boy can come with me i can not sit in the compound like an old man i must practice my skills\ni give you my word as a warrior i will not try to escape\nhe is there the wind has shifted we must wait\nnever approach your prey from upwind the breeze will carry your scent the wind is shifting again\nhe is there\nremember the scent more than anything else it will guide you\nlet it work its way into your blood\nyes this is the moment where life and death meet this is what we are warriors\nthere is much you were never taught\ni have done nothing more than show them what they are\nand what about to q i saw what happened to him when he caught the scent of his prey on the wind for the first time in his life he felt powerful and that is what he has been denied living here and that is what you have tried to take away from him now you may be content to sit here in the jungle and wither to old age but to q and the others have tasted what it is to feel truly alive and they will not give that up now\nor\nthen that is what you will have to do\nthat death will be honourable the young people will see what it is to die as a klingon\nenter bael\nwhy are you doing this bael\ni am not going to run away bael bael\nyes but they will not defeat me bael\na klingon does not run away from his battles bael\nthen you do not yet

knowledge of their origins knowledge of the real reasons you are here in this camp the truth is a threat to you\nyou see to kath it is already too late\nyears ago your parents made a great sacrifice for the sake of their families today they do so again for that we must honour them you must promise them never reveal to their secret no one must know of this place\nthank you sir\nno sir there was no

very good to see you both again beverly may i call you beverly beverly have you noticed that the mean temperature here on ark aria is slightly higher normal for human comfort levels i have found that humans prefer a body temperature of twenty one degrees celsius in order to operate most efficiently however there are several cultures who actually prefer that their body temperature is identical to the temperature of the room in which they are standing the shelia k for example\nhmm yes i find it fascinating that your family chose to drop the prefix pel from your surname it was my understanding that pe lorton is a more noble appellation on ark aria than simply orton\nperhaps the recent ark arian trend toward a more egalitarian society is partly responsible eh\nas a matter of fact i find it oddly amusing\nthere are several cultures in this sector with extremely similar etymological histories for example\nthe pleasure is mine hutch i have been meaning to compliment you on your choice of

you you have never seen anything like this there were thousands of these creatures the whole northern sky turned dark i\noh please call me hutch\ni was just telling your captain about some of the fascinating sights here on ark aria either of you interested in ornithology\nthe mating habits of the ark arian horn fowl are quite interesting if the weather were better we could take horses to the southern promontory and visit the nesting grounds\nyes we have a network of trails through the plains unfortunately its not very pleasant right now cold muddy not a soul for kilometres\nabsolutely\namazing man you know he reminds me of another officer i knew years ago a captained well now he was fascinating born on gaspar seven but you wouldnt know it from the way he looked\nthe crew of the magellan actually put on a talent show here captain conklin did a poetry reading if you can imagine that\ndid i ever tell you how i came to be stationed here its a fascinating

draining the tri lithium at one hundred milligrams per minute\nneil whats going on neil get over here put that down\ni know that how long before the baryon sweep gets here\nall right were leaving but were taking the tri lithium with us\nwhat about mot\nkelsey to kiros\nwe have a problem theresa starfleet officer still on board he skilled sat ler and he may have killed dev or he also destroyed the diverter in engineering so we have to leave here before the baryon sweep enters this section\nwere taking it with us to ten forward there should be enough time before picard\nmister motor should i call you lieutenant lieutenant commander perhaps\ni wouldnt need to improvise if you hadnt damaged our field diverter but if youre so concerned about the tri lithium\ni suggest you stop interfering with us kelsey\nwhat makes you think im a terrorist\nyou might be right mister mot but we ve been planning this for a long time and i doubt that youll really be able to stop us\nor even slow us down\ncome on dont be so tense neil if something goes wrong you wont have time to worry about it lets go\nthree more decks then we take corridor fifteen ball the way to ten forward\nwe have to find another way up the rungs are cut\nthat wasnt very clever mister mot\nif you knew where we were you should have attacked us now well just take another route one you might not be able\nto predict\nthat

go\nyour e the only one who needs a deal mot\ncaptain picard this is all beginning to make sense\nim not a terrorist captain nor do i have a political agenda although i know some people who do have

ten\ni have mott\nyes\nunderstood\nthis way move\nhe shot him with some kind of a narrow\nwhat about neil\ncaptain\nno after you\nalmost ive requested two additional field diverters one for the computer core and one for the bridge they havent been installed yet\nyes sir weve logged in five years more warp hours than most ships do intenso our baryon particle levels are high im a little concerned that when there mm ler array starts to sweep the ship it ll have to use a stronger beam than normal in order to get rid of all the radiation\nid say about twenty minutes\ncaptain permission to be\nabout twenty five minutes sir\nyou keep a saddle onboard the enterprise\noh he went back to the ship to get his saddle\nany serious rider would have his own saddle\nprobably he went right to the stable si be the sten kilometres from here already\ni dont know i was just getting some very strange energy readings from your table here\nmay be i should take a look at it for you\nwell maybe i should look at the heating element i mean in case it\npardon me\nwere going to need two more conduits\nwheres the interface\nokay that should do it i think\nyes yes that does it all right transfer five hundred milligrams from the reserve system to the engine core\nperfect\ndont worry ive got it ill be right there\nthe primary inducer is completely fused theres no way to fix it without the diverter we dont have any protection from the baryon sweep\nabout twelve minutes we should go to ten forward thats the last place on the ship that ll be swept by the baryon field\nwhat do you know how volatile tri lithium is we cant just start hauling it through the ship\nill ill try to make some modifications\nthere three hundred milligrams of tri lithium im using a dynamic stabiliser to act as a control rod there that should keep the resins table enough for transport\nwhats wrong\nhow much farther do we have to go\nno just remove the control rod drain the unit there shouldnt be any problem\nbeverly lovely as ever how do you manage it\nthe diverters have to be synchronised i was laser bonding a backup link\ncaptain if youre on schedule id like to confirm that well begin the baryon sweep at fifteen hundred hours approximately one hour from now\ncommander hutchinson also wanted me to make sure that you ll be able to attend his reception this afternoon\nhell be delighted to

worry\ni assure you its all right well look into it you dont have to concern yourself\nstay right where you are\nthere is nothing to discuss sit down\ni am not interested in hearing your hostage negotiation tactics commander\nall right\nno open up the transporters in cargo bay two and divert everyone from decks even to there that should put it back on track\nall right all right have commander laforge transport a stasis unit from the astrophysics lab you should be able to convert it to store tissue samples\noh i think we can resume the sequence counsellor troi is taking care of the situation on deck seven\nbridge\nyes it has\nexactly\nmister data are you all right\nsmalltalk\nperhaps it was a little too non relevant but if you really are interested in smalltalk then you should keep your eye on commander hutchinson at the reception this afternoon hesa master\ngentlemen gentlemen were running out of time mister worf\nare we ready commander laforge\nadditional units\nand that might overload the field diverters protecting our key systems how long until the new ones are in place\nvery well computer disable all command functions in thirty minutes authorisation picard gamma six zero seven three\nin my ready room mister worf\npermission granted i wish i could excuse myself as well\nmister laforge i can not excuse my entire senior staff mister worf beat you to it\ngo ahead

deanna troi this is commander hutchinson\nhorses\nsounds perfect mister laforge how long before the baryon sweep begins on the enterprise\nthen i have enough time to back to the ship and get my saddle\nyes a saddle is a very personal thing it has to be broken in used cared for\noh yes yes i never know when ill have the opportunity to ride\nits perfectly normal most serious riders do have their own saddles\nwell if you ll excuse me\nsomeone left this junction box open i thought your crew was supposed to be off the ship once the field diverters were in place\ni see well id better let you finish up so you can get off the ship\nhey hey who are you what are you doing on my ship\nyour e probably right but id like to bet this will a laser welder can be deadly whats going on in main engineering i suggest that you cooperate\nyou sure\nseems your e right\nmy name is mo tim the barber\nyes i know but i wanted to go riding but i didnt have my saddle so i went back to get it and\nyes thats right its on deck seven i left it in the corridor and then the power went out and i got lost\nall right just dont point that thing at me\nyou know better than to try and move tri lithium

fall into the hands of terrorists\ntri lithium resin is a highly toxic waste product produced by our engines\nits only possible use could be as a weapon\nthere are only so many ways to ten forward ten forward is the logical place to be if you want to stay ahead of the baryon sweep\ni plan on leaving the same way you do on your ship\nif you ve been planning this so long you must have a way of getting off the enterprise and leaving this system i think you have a ship coming for you i plan to be on it\nim sorry to hear that ill send your regrets\nhes not dead\nkelsey perhaps we can work out

not sure which one to feel sorry for\ngeordi what happened to the captain\nhis saddle\noh\nlucky him thank you\nnonstop i have to admit it has a certain strange fascination how long can two people talk about nothing\nwhat was all that about\nno demands no political statements no theft they must want something\norton may be improvising maybe he didnt plan to take us hostage so early and now he doesnt know what to do\nmaybe but we need to figure out how to use it how is he\ni doubt if they ll agree to that but maybe if we tell them geordi s dying they would give us access to a medical kit we might be able to use some of the tools to make a weapon\ncan you make the adjustments on the visor by yourself itll look suspicious if your e both working on it\nall right be as casual as you can let us know when your e ready\nhow is he doctor\nhow long\ni think i can distract orton for a few seconds\nyou just have to know how to talk to him or toni think we need to discuss the situation\ntheres a lot to discuss cant we be reasonable\nit cant hurt you to listen can it\nthank you now the first thing i think we need to discuss is this\ni did he just didnt like what i had to say\nthis must be the sign they were waiting for mister data you will be the only one unaffected by the hypersonic burst as soon as every else is unconscious i need you to get to the computer panel and stop that ship somehow\nive had three security teams search decks even they couldnt find anything\nmister worf im surprised at you\nreduce the plasma pressure to zero point six percent nominal\nhow does the conduit look\nallright the main plasma flow has been shunted to the aft conduit were ready here\nsit down\njust do what i tell you and you wont have to worry\ncaptain were still behind schedule on decks seven

noticed that the applause this evening exceeded average decibel levels\nexcuse me i have not yet congratulated ensign cheney\nis there a problem geordi\nmusic i do not hear anything\nthermal deflectors generate a field approximately four hundred metres wide we would need to cross connect six units and align them so the fields overlap\nyes sir\naye sir\ni hear music\nare you sure i know i heard something oh its stopped\nbers all in firestorm s happen on seven year cycle theyre not expecting any for another eight months\na firestorm can kick up winds of over two hundred kilometres per hour and temperatures as high as three hundred degrees c\nit was both reinforced and insulated but this is no ordinary storm its twice as strong as anything theyve ever seen the outpost just wont withstand it\na firewall\nyou know it might the storm is approaching the outpost from this direction if we were to set up a series of thermal deflector units along the northern perimeter we could create a firewall and deflect some of the heat the insulation from the outpost should be able to handle the rest\ntwelve two per team cross connecting that many units will be a little tricky once they reset up well have to leave the units in place and transport our people out nobody would be able survive very long outside that structure\nlaforge to bridge\nthe ionization from the storm is interfering with the transporters captain im compensating but its slowing things down a bit\nlaforge here\ncaptain the storms interference wont\nyes sir\nnow at three point two commander\ncompensating\nin or out just close that door and dont move it ll take a second for our eyes to read just okay lev ate to three point two marquez\ngood good we can do this nono no were losing vertical alignment compensate compensate\ngently gently marquez dont bump it no nowait hit the oh forget it forget it lights whoever you are you just ruined four hours of work\nits three oclock in the morning captain picard\nyes sir im sorry its just we were nt expecting anybody to be up at this hour\nthats why i put in for this assignment sir\nearl grey no wonder you cant sleep computer bring replicators back online and give me a cup of daren herbal tea blend number three hot you shouldnt be drinking a stimulant at this time of night i think youll like this\nive programmed seven other blends into the replicator you rebound to like one of them\nim sorry if the system blackouts we requested inconvenienced you were taking very precise gravimetric readings it wouldnt have taken much to throw them off\nim trying to construct a mathematical model of an emerging star system if it works well be able to predict the configuration of a star system that wont be formed for another two million years\ni have a few things to do between now and then\nwell done mister data well done\nthank you\ni guess that means they enjoyed themselves\npractising was never my problem in fact my parents had to make me go out and play\nyour e a musician whats your instrument we should play some time\nwell captain now that im on your ship maybe you should start expecting the unexpected\nexcuse me siri was hoping that my people in spectral analysis could have another few hours on the main sensor array\nif we go offline now well lose the gas flow pattern we ve been tracking\nwere at a critical juncture sir\ntomorrow tomorrow thank you sir\ni hope you dont mind me dropping by like this\nwhat kind of flute is that\nive never saw one before\nhave you been playing long\nid love to hear you play some time\nthat doesnt matter as long as you enjoy it\nmay i try\nplease\nyour e better than you think really we should play together\nah but there is\ni picked it upon mata line two its amazing\nyou start and ill jump in\nwhat were you working on before i came in\nperfect go ahead\nits all right your e not used to playing with anyone are you\ni may not be as precise as a computer but i think youll enjoy it more why dont we start with something a little simpler how about\ngood very good now lets have a little fun with it\nyou try it improvise around the melody anything you want\nthats wonderful keep going its so good\nyour e definitely better than you think\nive been playing the piano a lot i guess the captain and i over did it a little last night\nyes he plays a kind of flute are ssi kani think he said\nhe never did before he seemed to enjoy it hes actually quite promising\ntell me have you known him long\nhe seems somewhat isolated\nthat feels much better thank you\ni was afraid i might have to cancel\nkeep climbing\nwere almost there\ndo you know where we are\nno this is the most acoustically perfect spot on the ship\nthe intersection acts as a resonance chamber\na little exploring\nwell not everyone try it see how it sounds\nthats beautiful what is it\nive never heard you play with such feeling\nid heard about ker elian tenors all my life but nothing could ve prepared me for this mans voice soaring incredible range wonderful\ni should be finished with my survey by eleven hundred hours\ncome in\ncan i help you sir\ni understand im glad you told me for a minute there i thought id misread you one kiss and your e off to find somebody else\nyes\nnever heard of it\ni dont understand\nwhy are you telling me this\nthank you\ncommander i was hoping to talk to you about ensign cabot s transfer\nbut he wants to come to my department\ni offered it to him\nim sorry we were just talking and\ncommander please dont make that decision final i realise i shouldnt have made the offer but he s perfect for the job and quantum mechanics is overstaffed anyway\nwell i think im just doing what any good department head would do trying to build the best staff i can\ni cant believe im going to get the chance to study the firestorm son bers all is apparently they re generated by particle emissions from the bers all in sun they cause a cascade effect in the planets atmosphere that o him boring you\nabout the personnel transfer i thought he looked uncomfortable he thought i was asking for special treatment i was just doing what i thought was best for my department\ni dont like the thought of having to second guess people all the time if i have to worry about what people are thinking about me ill be concentrating on the wrong thing and i wont be as effective an officer\nnoted sir\nwhat about that special dessert you promised me\nthey form when solar flare radiation reacts with high energy plasma present in the planets atmosphere\ni led a team of geologists to study the plasma geyser on mel nos four we cross connected a few thermal deflector units to create a protective shield against the heat\nwould something like that work here\ni assume commander riker chose me because im the best person for the job didnt we agree not to let our relationship get in the way of our work ill be all right\ndaren here go ahead commander\nim here with team six were just about to bring the deflectors online\ndaren to perimeter team standby to cross connect deflectors\nactivate team three increase your output by point two percent\ngood good deng decrease nutation by point four percent good weve almost got it\ndaren to commander riker\nwe ve got a problem were having trouble keeping the deflectors cross connected so the only way this is going to work is if we calibrate them manually\ndaren to perimeter teams the storms interference is going to make our job harder than we thought we may lose communication so its up to each of you to keep your units operational a lot of people are depending on us daren out\nohmygod\nthats it\nthank you captains log stardate 466972 although we succeeded in rescuing all six hundred forty three bers all in colonists we lost eight crew members let the record show that they gave their lives in the performance of their duty\nwhen communications went out i knew we had to fend for ourselves we modified our phasers to create resonant disruptions in the deflector field the disruptions formed small pockets inside the plane of the field and we each stood inside one to wait out the storm richardson didnt make it all deng and i could do was stand there and watch\ndont dont say your e sorry\nat first when you told us to hold our positions i didnt question it of course we would that was our job but when i saw that storm coming toward us\na small part maybe but in the end i was more afraid that you would blame yourself if i died would you have\nif i stayed here you might have to\nand you could resign yours and come to a starbase with me ill apply for a transfer\nof course promise me something dont give up your music back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc

need to report im just here to do some work on my own\nid like to talk to doctor mo wray a this archaeological site on land ris two could you put it through to my ready room\nhow long will it be\nno its not important\ncomputer display the latest excavation schematics on land ris two\nexplain\ntea earl grey hot\nstellar cartography\nwhat could they possibly be doing down there\nyou might have taken the simple precaution of locking the door\ni assume that you must be lieutenant commander daren\nwell you renew on the enterprise youll have to learn to expect the unexpected\nexcellent now perhaps you can tell me what was so important that it required depriving the captain of his cup of earl grey\ni look forward to sampling them\nwhat were the readings for\na long time to wait to see if youre right\nyes i understand it has unusual radioactive emissions and im sure that stellar sciences will find it a most interesting study\nwell you have the bridge number one\nill be there\nand so the upshot is that well be close enough for you to slip away for a few days and see wesley\nit san herbal tea blend ier found it in the replicator files have you met any of the new crew members who came aboard at starbase two eighteen\ni met the new head of stellar sciences last night lieutenant commander daren\ndid you know it is now possible to predict the configuration of a star system which wont be formed for another two million years\nits really quite intriguing the whole thing is made possible by a complex mathematical construct based on fractal particle motion but thats only the foundation the modeling itself is done by gravimetric wave input\nwell i know this is all pretty dry stuff stellar cartography isnt everybodys cup of tea\nyou know wed should be getting along to ten forward were going to be late for the concert\nthank you\ncommander that was a remarkable performance\ni think that much was obvious\ncommander you must have been playing since you were young i played the piano for awhile when i was small but i didnt put in the practice you must have\ni wanted to ask during the second arpeggio in the first movement i noticed that you played an f minor chord instead of a diminished d\nno no no im just an amateur but your choice in that arpeggio was delightful not at all what one would expect\ncomputer pause playback come oh commander daren\nno please come in im delighted\nits ress ikan\ntheyre not made any more\ner yes a long time\nim not very good\nyes but i wouldnt want to inflict it on someone else\nyes of course yes your e not holding it quite right may i\nthere isnt a piano\nthat is remarkable why dont you play something\nwhat shall we play\nbach the third brandenburg\nim sorry\njust the computer\nnumber one my fencing partners cancelled for this afternoon i was wondering if you wanted to join me\nit doesnt matter so as long as you enjoy it\ngood excellent fourteen hundred hours then\nwhere are we going\ni dont see why we couldnt just practice in my quarters\nyes this is the fourth intersect in jefferies tube twenty five\nhow did you find it\nyou mean to say you climbed through every tube on the ship\nits an old folk melody\ni understand there are nuances that only ker elian scan pickup we just dont have the ears for it\nvery good commander\nwe dont rendezvous with the havana for another two days that ll give us plenty of opportunity to study this phenomenon\ncounsellor could i speak with you in my ready room you have the bridge number one\nsit down counsellor i want to talk to you about a matter of protocol i know there are no starfleet regulations about a captain becoming involved with a fellow officer but\nits that obvious\nbut i have to be concerned about more than my own happiness\nyes relationships with coworkers can be fraught with consequences\nyou seem ive always believed that becoming involved with someone under my command would compromise my objectivity and yet\nif i were would you give it\nnella\nim really very sorry about what happened in the turbolift when the crew member walked in i felt very self conscious its going to take a while for me to get used to the idea of crew seeing the two of us together\ni can assure you that im not given to casual relationships there is something that i want to tell you but not here\ndo you remember that folk melody i played for you this morning\ni learned it on a planet called kata an\nno im not surprised its sun went nova more than a thousand years ago\nthe enterprise encountered a probe that had been sent from the planet before it was destroyed it had scanned me and i lost consciousness and in the space of twenty five minutes i lived a lifetime on that planet i had a wife and children and a grandchild and it was absolutely real to me when i awoke all that i had left of that life there was the flute that i had taught myself to play\nbecause i want you to understand what my music means to me and what it means for me to be able to share it with someone\ncome\nyes of course come in number one\nbecause of her relationship with me\nare her requests unusual\nwould you say that she s just trying to do her job\nthen let her do it and feel free to do yours ships resources are your responsibility ive always had absolute confidence in your judgment\nno no no your e not its just that commander riker came to talk to me this afternoon about you\nthats what i told him but we have to be careful obviously its easy for people to misunderstand\nall im saying is that its something we have to be aware of but you must nt compromise yourself you must do what you have to do because if i find that my head of stellar sciences isnt being effective then i shall do what i must todo and is hall replace her\nnow i think that we should just forget about this and enjoy out evening\nright now this is something that i first tasted on the lk a four\ngo ahead mister worf\nim on my way captains log stardate 466931 we have entered the bers all is star

out\npicard to mister laforge\ni want a signal lock on every member of the perimeter teams\nas soon as the last of the colony is evacuated i want those perimeter teams out of there is that understood\nwhich teams are missing\ngo ahead mister worf\nim on my way\nim so sorry\nit must have been terrible\npart of you must have blamed me\nive lost people under my command people who were very dear to me but never someone ive been in love with and when i believed that you were dead i just began to shut down i didnt want to think or feel i was here in my quarters and the only thing i could focus on was my music and how it would never again give me any joy then i saw you standing on the transporter pad and i knew that i could never again put your life in jeopardy\nyou could always resign your commission stay here with me\nbut we could still see each other people do we could arrange shore leave together and for the future who knows\ncaptain well be arriving at the borgo lis nebula in three hours\ncommander daren has already requested extra time on the main sensor array\nim sorry the array has already been allocated to engineering theyre running some warp field tests\ni understand but there are other departments waiting to use the array\ncommander ill see what i can do to find you some more time tomorrow\nfencing im really not very good\nwhy not\nhelm set course for bers all is three warp five\nhello\nquantum mechanics doesnt want to give him up\nhow do you know that\ntransfers are to be approved by me before any offers are made\nits all right but cabot should stay where he is\ncommander do you realise the position your e putting me in\nlook ill review the situation and let you know as soon as i can\nmay i have a minute\nits about lieutenant commander dare nasa department heads he comes to me for systems allocation personnel transfers things like that im beginning to feel uncomfortable with her requests\nyes sir\nno\nyes sir\nthank you sir\nwell arrive about an hour before the storm gets there it will take at least two hours to evacuate all the colonists off the surface\nhow many people would it take to set that up\nthe storm is going to interfere with communications everything will need to be coordinated from the surface mister data you will coordinate the evacuation of the colonists doctor they have nine patients in the outpost infirmary your first priority will be to get them to sickbay after that you will stay onboard the enterprise be ready to receive casualties marquez you will take some people down and track the storm all the other teams will need to be kept apprised of its heading commander youre in charge of deploying the deflectors lets go\nlieutenant marquez has already set up on the surface apparently the storm is still gaining speed hes estimating\nitll hit the colony in less than fifty minutes ensign make sure you maintain a continuous transporter lock on all away team personnel we may have to pull them out in a hurry\ni dont want to take any unnecessary chances if they get into trouble beam them up immediately\nriker to daren\nyou ve got less than nine minutes before the storm reaches the northern perimeter\nwhenever you re ready\nriker here go ahead\nif you stay with the deflectors will they protect you when the storm hits nella\nseventy three sir\nat least ten more minutes\ni got out with the last of the colonists if it hadnt been for the perimeter teams none of us would have made it we were able to clear out four of the teams and the interference prevented us from getting two more i dont know how they could have survived\nthree and six\nthe last i knew commander daren was on team six\nyou would like my opinion about you and commander daren\nin a way that pleases people who care about your happiness yes it is\nand you think that your feelings toward nella could change the way you function as captain\nthats true but cutting yourself off from your feelings can carry consequences that are just as serious\ncaptain are you asking my permission\nyes\ncaptain the federation outpost on bers all is three reports that they are entering a period of firestorm activity\nbridge to captain\nbers all is three reports that the storm has changed its speed and heading they are predicting it will hit the outpost within eight hours and are requesting evacuation\nseventeen

different life form from nineteen different worlds\nwhat is it\ni know how it sounds but theres no way this could be a random formation this is definitely part of a programme\nso four billion years ago someone scattered this genetic material into the primordial soup of at least nineteen different planets across the galaxy\nthen they must be from worlds outside the federation mister data how many

why it was destroyed\ntheres only one planet in the kurl an system capable of supporting life loren three\nyes and i will fire on anyone who attempts to obtain another one\nthis is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are scattered across the galaxy doesnt it make it natural to assume that the original designers of the puzzle should want us to find it why else would they have put the pieces in our dna

found none like ourselves our civilisation thrived for ages but what is the life of one race compared to the vast stretches of cosmic time we knew that one day we would be gone that nothing of us would survive so we left you our scientists seeded the primordial oceans of many worlds where life was in its infancy the seed codes directed you revolution toward a physical form resembling ours this body you see before you which is of course shaped as yours is shaped for you are the end result the seed codes also contained this message which we scattered in fragments on many different worlds it was our hope that you would have to come together in fellowship and companionship to hear this message and if you can see and hear me our hope has been fulfilled you are a monument not to our greatness but to our existence that was our wish that you too would know life and would keep alive our memory there is something of us in each of you and so something of you in each other remember us\nthis is the klingon vessel mah tha what are you doing here captains log supplemental it seems that we have not one but two competitors in our attempt to complete professor ga lens puzzle i have prevailed upon the cardassian and klingon captains to meet with me\nminor damage to starboard nacelle we will be operational in less than one hour\nid say at least three y rid ians boarded the professors shuttle\nim not sure but it looks like they were trying to download something from his computer\nwe were able to partially reconstruct the shuttles computers so at least we have some of those files we found nineteen different blocks of numbers like this one\nwe tried every decryption key on record in case professor galen was using some kind of code we still cant make heads or tails of them\nat least some of them its impossible to say know many\nif they did that information died with them\nand there were no other vessels in the vicinity\nthis is not a natural design captain this is part of an algorithm coded at the molecular level\ni know how it sounds but theres no way this could be a random formation this is definitely part of a programme\nwell we couldnt know that until we assembled the entire programme and then ran it weve tried all the material in the federation computer but we havent been able to come up with any with compatible protein configurations\nyou know captain ive been thinking somebody else must know about this programme i bet one of the missing fragments was on indri eight thats why it was destroyed\nwhatthehell computer perform a level three diagnostic on the primary defensive systems laforge to captain picard\nyou might want to come down here i found something that i think you should see\nit once supported life\npaha ridiculous story\nscientific research\nas if we fear cardassian threats\nyes and there will be no other samples from indri eight\nthere is no secret it is an ancient weapon design of incredible power and the klingon empire will not allow it to fall into an enemy shands or even a friends\nbiscuits if that is what you believe then go back to cardassia i will send you my mothers recipe\nand if we refuse\nexcellent\npa hk we have surrendered what we had for nothing\nhow can that be we have no idea where to start looking for the missing fragment\ni intend to\ngood evening commander data\nis there any word yet on the missing fragment\ncommander your reputation for physical strength is known even in the klingon empire you are familiar with the baht q ul challenge\nwach a we j\nmaw tok\ni understand your intellectual prowess is equally impressive if i were to learn of the results from the computer search before the others the klingon empire would have a strategic advantage a being of your abilities would go far in the empire\nnot at all\ncommander never mind\nit is fortunate that your engineer discovered gulo cet ts attempt to tamper with your defensive systems mah tha status\nwhat you incompetent to pa you were supposed to be prepared\ni will go with you\nyou dishonorable top a\nhow\ni will not be eliminated now\netched in stone no doubt no deals there will be no deals as long as im still alive\nwe die together brother tash kohta h\nthats all if she were not dead i would kill her\nmy name is gulo cett identify yourselves and state your business in this star system\ni suppose not but my admittedly hasty estimate shows one federation starship and two cardassian war vessels perhaps i have mis counted\nand you have nothing to lose by delaying a purely scientific mission for a few days i invite you to withdraw\nwe were merely scouting the planet for possible colonization\nwhat were you doing here then\nha\nyes and i will fire on anyone who attempts to obtain another one\nwhat is that supposed to mean\ntypical klingon thinking take what you want and destroy the rest\na weapon they rid ian who sold us the information claimed that the programme would yield the key to an unlimited power source\nhes right as far as we know it might just be a recipe for biscuits\nhow dare you\nwhat do you propose\nyou are remarkably shortsighted nuda q we are closer to the answer than we were\nperhaps we could exchange insults some other time im rather busy now\nis hall destroy the entire rock face and every trace of with it you will go back to romulus empty handed your superiors will be quite pleased\nhow can i be sure you wont kill me if i acquiesce\nthe very notion that a cardassian could have anything in common with a klingon it turns my stomach\nensign lay in a course to the next one three quarters impulse\ngo ahead number one\nill be right there\nohmygod\nprofessor galen\nno one is could be more welcome on the enterprise i never thought i would see ak url anna is kos fifth dynasty\noh please mister will do fine well the overall configuration is certainly fifth dynasty the surface ornamentation\ngreen polychrome over the eyes and the eyes themselves are closed this is third dynasty from the workshop of the master of tarquin hill\nwill the master of tarquin hill designed ceramic objects that were three hundred years ahead of their time all we know of him is the work his name has never been discovered this object is over twelve thousand years old\nindeed i thought your study of kurl an artefacts was done long ago\nyou mean its complete\nwill the kurl an civilisation believed that an individual was a community of individuals inside us are many voices each with its own desires its own style its own view of the world the kurl an civilisation died out thousands of years ago it is extraordinarily rare to find a figurine intact professor this is an incredible find\noh no no how can i accept this\nthank you how long can you stay theres so much to talk about\ntwo days but thats not enough time\ni dont understand\nmay i ask you a frank question\nyour published writings have been sporadic for the last decade your appearance at symposia has been rare or scheduled and then cancelled at the last moment the finest archaeologist of the century is now shrouded with a cloak of mystery\nive never heard of anyone that didnt love a good mystery\nso what have you been doing for the past decade\nyes its the study of fossil record sat the microscopic level i read your papers on the subject but that was years ago it seemed as though the work had stopped\ntell me\nfor how long\nwhy do you need my help in this\nim deeply honoured that you d think of me but i have responsibilities\nmay i sleep on it\ndream not of today the night blessing of the ya shel\nwell ive had a few years to look it up professor the enterprise is yours for as long as your e here\ndream not of today\ncome\nyes\ni had a long talk with professor galen last night he asked me to leave the enterprise to join him in an archaeological expedition which could last for nearly a year\ni couldnt leave the enterprise but the offer raised in me certain feelings of regret\nno not really im not sorry for the path i chose but the professor did not choose this figure at random the many voices inside the one you see he knows that the past is a very insistent voice inside of me this gift is meant to remind me of that\ni wouldnt trade it for anything and i would still make the same choice i made all those years ago i just wish that i didnt have to say no to him a second time\ni had a father but he was like a father who understood me and he had his own children but they didnt follow in his footsteps so i was like the son who understood him\nin away i wish he d never come onboard the ship\nprofessor\nprofessor im afraid i wont be going the enterprise isnt something that i can leave and then come back to ifi goigo for good its not something im not prepared to do\nyou dont believe that my career in starfleet has been a mistake\nwe both know thats not true\ni never wanted to become\ni cant\nbut professor your e not scheduled to catch the vulcan ship for another two days\ntake us out of warp on screen\nget him out of there\nreturn phaser fire disable their offensive systems\ntransporter room one lock on to professor galen and transport him directly to sickbay\nwhat did they want\nwhat do they mean\napparently they rid ians knew more about the professors work than we do they may have known what these numbers mean\nnot necessarily they rid ians are information dealers they may have been delivering the number blocks to someone else did they send a signal before they were destroyed\ndid the shuttles flight logs show where galen had been before coming to the enterprise\nwhats the distance from our present position\nthe conference can wait set a course for the rua h system\nscan for earthworks or monuments that might indicate a previous civilisation\nthen what was the foremost archaeologist in the federation doing here he left the enterprise in a vulcan ship for deep space four and then an alley an transport to caere and then the shuttle to indri eight mister data what do we know about indri eight\nnumber one well proceed to indri eight\nim aware of the federations timetable number one professor galen visited here a few days ago and he was on his way to indri eight when he was killed theres some connection between these two planets im going to find it\ncome\ni thought if i stared at these number blocks long enough then i would begin to see some kind of pattern so far nothing\nif i had gone with him\ni realise that\ncounsellor this is not simply a case of me taking the enterprise and its crew on some wildgoose chase to purge myself of guilt and remorse i will not let ga lens death to be in vain now if that means inconveniencing a few squabbling delegates for a few days then so be iti will take the full responsibility\non my way\non screen mister worf\ncan we stop it\nall the life perhaps the professors number blocks had something to do with organic matter\nill be in the lab\nfragments\nthe planets that these fragments are from are scattered across the quadrant no wonder it took the professor so long to collect them but why\nbut how can that be possible theyre different species from different planets there should be no compatibility at all\nwhat is it\nan algorithm are you saying that these fragments are elements in some kind of computer programme\nso four billion years ago someone scattered this genetic material into the primordial soup of at least nineteen different planets across the galaxy\nand what was this programme designed to do\nthen they must be from worlds outside the federation mister data how many people on the enterprise are from non federation planets\nyou know this may be a long shot but we should check each one of these seventeen people to see if they have the correct protein configurations\nto keep us from finding that piece of the puzzle its four billion years old a computer programme from a highly advanced civilisation and its hidden in the very fabric of life itself whatever information this programme contains could be the most profound discovery of our time or the most dangerous and the professor knew that\nwell i have been through every page of the professors published works looking for some clue as to where to go next so far nothing\ni was in the neighbourhood when i asked the professor why he went all the way to kurl he said i was in the neighbourhood doing what\ntheres only one planet in the kurl an system capable of supporting life loren three\nmister dataset course for loren three maximum warp\nthere is a good chance that our competition may be here before us battlestations mister worf\non screen\non screen\ni am captain jean luc picard of the federation starship enterprise and i see no reason why i should answer to you cardassians have no claims in this sector\nnot at all but we are on a purely scientific mission you have no reason to interfere with us\ni believe we all know why were here if we admit that then we can move forward\nlook if we try to deceive one other then we shall get nowhere i think we all know about professor ga lens research and about the computer programme composed of fragments ill take your silence as confirmation now it stands to reason that none of us has the dna fragments necessary to complete the programme you were the first to arrive in this system do you have an organic sample from the planet below\ni believe that one of you has a fragment from indri eight\nhe destroyed the biosphere of the planet after he had taken the sample\nwere all missing some of the fragments not necessarily the same ones unless we combine the ones we have we will never learn the secret of the programme\nbut until we assemble it we will never know its purpose\nmyria p enough without cooperation we will get nowhere\nif you each bring your samples onboard the enterprise i will combine them with ours and then we will all observe the results simultaneously giving no one the advantage\nthen this endeavour dies here in this room\nwe may be very much closer indeed\nthis is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are scattered across the galaxy doesnt it make it natural to assume that the original designers of the puzzle should want us to find it why else would they have put the pieces in our dna and in turn doesnt suggest they would try to make it easy for us to find those pieces that there might be some pattern to their distribution\ndoctor programme the computer to analyse the distribution of the pieces that we have correcting for changes in star configurations over four billion years then extrapolate for the missing piece\nif you wish you can stay on board while we wait\nwhat is it geordi\nreport number one\nwell it wont take them long to realise that rahm iza dis the wrong planet captain your e welcome to join us\nensign set in a course for the vil moran system warp nine\nengage\nany sign of the cardassians\nacknowledged\nwait for my order number one\nthe seabed it may be only partially fossilised it could still contain organic material\nthe programme has been activated i think its reconfiguring the tricorder\nits modifying the

you get out of here your e going to stand trial\ni imagine the punishment will be quite severe considering you stabbed him nine times\nhe broke out of his cell last night we found him running down a

federation research team was on the planet its believed that they were forced into hiding your mission will be to locate and to evacuate them\nthere are no local authorities the government is splintered it seems that there are various factions vying for power theyre desperate for weapons or technology of any kind apparently some of the factions have resorted to torture to gather their information well a starfleet research team would be a prime target\nagreed mister worf is ready to give you a detailed briefing on til on ian culture\nohno not here ll be plenty of time for that we dont arriving at til on us for another five days and besides if you back out shell come after me to play the part\nit was cold and dark because i was outdoors at night i was in a narrow place i was walking through an alley\nsomeone must have followed me into the alley thats why i started to walk faster someone grabbed me from behind\nthree humanoid i only saw the face of one of them\nwere your colleagues you can trust us everything will be all right\nwill please\nnumber one do you remember what happened you were abducted during the mission to til on us four you were put into a psychiatric

willing to take that chance\nevidently you were abducted two days after beaming to the surface\nwe believe that they were trying to extract strategic information from your memory using an euro somatic

now and im confident that when i leave i will be ready to take my place in society again\nwell now right away\nyou said that when i was able to accept what id done and i understood the consequences of my actions that i would be free to go\nno im looking forward to proving my innocence\nthats thats not what i meant i was sick when it happened i wasnt responsible for what i did\nnoi want to talk about this now\nwhat i need is to get out of this cell ive been locked in here for days youve controlled my every move youve told me what to eat and what to think and what to say and when i show a

to go down there alone undercover\nwell i guess ill have to back out of beverly splay after all\nthe southwest quarter covers over two hundred square kilometres thats a lot of land for one man to cover i guess id better pack an extra pair of boots\nit doesnt really match the outfit\nof course i do\nits okay i guess i really wasnt paying attention id better go to sickbay well continue this later\nthe plays not till tomorrow night ive still got twenty four hours\nright that still hurts\nprobably just a symptom of stage fright\nive been on a lot of missions seen a lot of people injured but ive never been affected by anything like this he was looking right at me\nit was as if he was blaming me for something this wasnt the only incident the last several days ive felt like everybody s staring at me or talking about me its as if i was in frame of mind\nbeverly splay ever since i began rehearsing for the role ive been uneasy and restless\nright the play is full of disturbing images people losing their minds being tortured by doctors i cant get it out of my mind\nmay be your e right\nwho was that you just missed him is there a new lieutenant on board\nno ill check them tomorrow im going to be dearly the performance is tomorrow night i want to be up for it\nill try not to take you literally\nyou be tim agitated i may be surrounded by insanity but i am not insane and nothing you or anyone else can say will change that and i wont let you or anyone else tell me that i am you may be able to destroy my mind but you cant change the fact that im innocent i didnt kill that man

all been shocked by recent events i dont see that there s anything to gain by dragging us through these insinuations\nwe are trying to forget the unpleasantness of these last several days not have them stirred up again i find it disturbing that you would try to foster suspicions among us\ni find your question distasteful\nim sure its nothing i was in the storage room of the science laboratory yesterday kura k was working in the lab rey ga came in and they got into well an argument\ni dont know i couldnt hear clearly until they started to shout at one other then i heard kura k say that rey

disgraced starfleet medical then a leisurely day and a half before the formal inquiry begins and my career ends\nyour elbow let me see it does this hurt\nthat stennis elbow all right here hold your arm like this\nwell ill see if i can arrange one for you all you have to do is disobey orders violate medical ethics and cause an interstellar incident\nmake a fist\nit all started when those scientists came on board no it started when i got curious\nthats why i went to the altin e conference id heard about a new subspace technology developed by a ferengi a doctor rey ga\nhis invention was based on met aphasic fields but his methodology was completely unorthodox\ntoo bad you werent there nobody else would listen to him they all but jeered him off the stage but i had read his paper and his work was extraordinary\nyes i hoped i could be a facilitator i thought if i invited scientists from various cultures to board the enterprise i could sit them and down help them understand the value of his ideas\nexactly so after persuading the captain i had to roundup as many scientists as i could from the field of subspace technology\nbut of all the scientists i invited only four were interested in hearing about doctor rey gas invention and i wasnt altogether sure they were going to be compatible kura k was a warp field specialist on the klingon home world i dont think klingons regard scientists very highly she always seemed a little defensive doctor tp an is practically a legend in the field of subspace morphology shes been the director of the vulcan science academy for fifteen years her husband doctor christopher came with her i didnt know much about him but he was some kind of subspace theoretician job ril was at a karan the first one id ever met i had no idea what to expect from him and then there was doctor rey ga the ferengi scientist\nthats why ive invited you all here you have the vision to see the potential of doctor rey gas met aphasic shield\ni think you all realise what this shielding process could mean the possibilities of exploration and research are endless\ndoctor rey ga has offered to demonstrate his invention hes outfitted one of our shuttles with his met aphasic shield\nwell need to be sure that your e familiar with the shuttles controls and doctor rey gas modifications\nwell what do you think\nwell then well proceed with the demonstration at fifteen hundred hours well meet on the bridge\nit wasnt exactly an enthusiastic response to doctor rey gas technology but given the circumstances and the scientists quarrelsome personalities i was quite pleased\ni thought that went well didnt you\ni didnt do anything\nsome of the scientists still seem a little doubtful but after the demonstration im sure they ll come around\ni still expect the scientific community to be a little more open than they seem to be\nyou mean jealousy i know i wondered if that might account for doctor t pans attitude shes been working on subspace shielding technology for years and youve beaten her to the punch\ni figured the hard part was over id stepped out on a limb and it hadnt broken\nnot bad for my first venture into scientific diplomacy\nthats right temperature in the cabin is twenty one degrees celsius and the radiation levels are normal\ntemperature is still twenty one degrees and the shield is holding\ntemperature inside the cabin is still normal\nsome things wrong\nwere losing him\nbeam him directly to sickbay\nat that point the doubts of the others seemed justified i had no idea what had gone wrong or how seriously doctorjob ril had been injured but i knew this incident could destroy rey gas chance to be accepted by the scientific community\ntwenty ccs in a pro valine its not working cortical stimulators now again\nso that was my first experience as a scientific diplomat a complete failure i dont understand\ni mean ive lost patients before\nmmm\nthats what i felt helpless\nyou know what you say reminds me of something jean luc said to me when i was doing the autopsy on job ril\nit was probably the most puzzling autopsy ive ever performed and the most frustrating because jobri ls anatomy was unlike any id encountered an dive run into some unusual specimens\nive never run into a humanoid species like this before his internal physiology s baffling he doesnt seem to have any discrete organs at least not in the traditional sense practically every system is equally distributed throughout the body that kind of physiology should make him incredibly resistant to injury so whatever killed him must have occurred at the cellular level\nno something caused a massive systemwide failure but i dont know what\nhis exposure to the stars radiation was minimal its all very strange theres no apparent cause of death\nthats odd the rate of cellular decay is extremely low\nmaybe even minimal exposure to the radiation altered the cellular physiology\ni cant sleep i want to find out what killed him i owe that to doctor rey ga\nwhat do you mean\nat the time i was too preoccupied with my problems to understand what he was saying i wasnt thinking about the rest of my life i was trying to make sense of what had happened\nand i wasnt alone jobri ls death had raised a lot of questions geordi and data were determined to find out what had gone wrong and they were busy going over every millimetre of the shuttle with doctor rey gas help\ndid you find anything wrong\nwere the levels high enough to cause damage to organic tissue\nrey ga seemed angry but i knew it was because he was so disappointed everything he d worked for hoped for was slipping away\nand that made what i had to do next even harder\nim sure you all understand that in light of what happened i think it would be inappropriate to continue further testing perhaps if doctor rey ga has perfected his met aphasic technology we can try again\nim sorry as chief medical officer im responsible for the health and safety of all the people aboard i will not authorise any further tests\ni couldnt help but admire his tenacity he just wasnt going to accept defeat and i hoped he would prove himself but that was the last time is a whim alive\nwed gone to sciencelab four when the ships sensors registered a sizable plasma surge there\nlook at this a plasma infuser its completely discharged the blast must have killed him instantly\nor perhaps someone just wanted it to look that way isnt it odd that he could hold on so tightly to the infuser when it was discharged the normal reflex would have been to drop it\nill know for certain when i do the autopsy\nfor now please have his body taken to the morgue\ni remembered his passion and commitment and his determination to prove himself and i was sure that this man had not taken his own life if anyone could understand that i knew it would be captain picard\njean luci was with him right before he died he was not suicidal\ni dont think so he was disappointed at the failure of his device and certainly he was upset at jobri ls death but i never got the sense that he was ready to end his own life and if thats true then someone else killed him\nnot yet but when i finished the autopsy i hope ill have it\nbut theres a question as to the circumstances of his death\nlet me speak with them\njean luci can not just drop this dont you see there may have been a murder\nits wont be clear until after an autopsy as far as i know he could have been poisoned and someone put the plasma infuser in his hand after he died\nim not discounting that possibility the point is without a complete autopsy theres no way of knowing for certain\nit has to do with their death rituals the body cant be violated before its buried apparently the family is more concerned about ritual than finding out the truth about how he died i just cant get the information i need from a tricorder scan suspects i frey ga didnt kill himself someone else did so who are the possible suspects\nand the only ones to fit that category are the other scientists\nno but i cant believe he took his own life and i would like to explore any possibilities a bit further\ni was wondering if you might have any thoughts along that line\ni frey gas technology had been successful you might have been displaced as the preeminent scientist in subspace technology\nim just trying to uncover the truth and i need your help to do it have you seen or heard anything that might suggest that someone else had a motive\nforgive me i dont mean to upset you but have you noticed anything unusual\nis there something your e not telling me\nabout what\nthank you\ni knew he might be right about kura k klingons make threats as a matter of course on the other hand sometimes they follow through\nthat looks like one of doctor rey gas shield configurations\neven though this technology failed\nwhich your e now free to develop\nno but i want to know why you threatened doctor rey ga\nwhat was his accusation\nwere they lies\ndid rey ga make that mistake\nwell youre going to have to throw me a lot harder than that if you want to get it now what did he accuse you of\nsabotage of the met aphasic shield was that why it failed\ndid you sabotage the project\nkura k refused to say anything more i wasnt sure if her silence was motivated by guilt or just klingon pride\ni was beginning to find out that investigating a murder was a little more perilous than id thought and for everything id been though i didnt have any more insight than i did before i started\nwhich brought me back to rey gas body because the more i thought about it the more it seemed that the answers had to be there traces tissue anomalies a wealth of forensic clues that could shed some light on the mystery so i made the decision\njean luci want to tell you something that you need to know but your e not going to like it i did an autopsy on doctor rey ga\nnothing im sorry i know i shouldnt have done it\nyou dont have to jean luci knew what i was doing and im prepared to accept the consequences\ni could tell that he was terribly disappointed in me and that was almost the hardest part of all\nso thats the story that show i ended mycareer\nwhat\nguinan two people died on this ship two lives that ended horribly and your e worried about your tennis game\ni dont know you tell me your e supposed to be wise\nive done everything i could think of it got me fired\nno\nyes\ndont you get it if i start digging around again\nwhat are you doing data\nyouve studied doctor rey gas shield system do you think it could have been sabotaged\njust consider the possibility\nthe only time the shield was active was during jobri ls test flight\ni agree would it be possible to sabotage the shuttle by remote during the flight\nwhere on the enterprise could you generate a phased ionic pulse\nlets assume for the moment that someone did send out a phased ionic pulse what would have happened inside the shuttle\nate

mean\nthank you commander your concern is noted\nyes will iknow but as a friend please try to understand i cant quit now and i dont want you to become involved in this\ncomputer access ships medical

way to know for certain\ntesting a theory captain\ni think doctor rey gas shield does work\nim sorry\ncomputer begin monitoring external temperature\ni think doctor rey ga was right about his shield

launched\nexternal temperature is zero point nine million kelvins and rising radiation levels are nearing ten thousand rads\noutside temperature is rising rapidly one point seven million

shuttle is emerging from the corona sir\nthe flow regulator is functioning properly\nyes doctor\ni am unable to locate any malfunction all systems are operating according to your design specifications\nperhaps there was an unexpected interaction between the solar radiation and the met aphasic shield\ni am running additional diagnostics to make certain there was no permanent radiation damage to the shuttlecraft hull\nthere was no evidence to suggest sabotage\nthe system interlocks prevent access to the circuitry unless the shield emitter is active any attempt to sabotage the device would have to be made while the shield was in operation\nthat is correct it seems unlikely that job ril would perform sabotage which would result in his own death\na phased ionic pulse beamed directly into the met aphasic projection matrix would result in a temporary system malfunction\nsuch a pulse could be initiated from the lateral sensor arrays science labs one four and sixteen or any of the bridge science stations\nate tryon field would be formed briefly in the cabin temporarily disrupting the met aphasic shield\ncaptain an unscheduled launch is taking place in shuttle bay two\nbearing

doctor rey ga i think your e on solid scientific ground\nim an accomplished pilot it will be no problem\ni am one million kilometres from the stars corona proceeding at three quarters impulse i should reach it in approximately three minutes\nwait im reading elevated neutrino levels in the cabin\nthree hundred and fifty thousand kilometres and closing this is incredible i am actually flying into a star\ni am now fully engulfed in the corona its astonishing\ni saw the sun\nthey can not hear you i have severed communications\nid think after your autopsy on me you d know the answer to that\nit is a natural result of physio stasis takara ns can control their physiology at a cellular level we can create the appearance of death\nmove away move away\nim sending out a transient subspace signal it will obscure the shuttle from the enterprise sensors and they will interpret it as a warp engine breach they will believe that you have been destroyed id like to thank you doctor\nall i wanted to do was discredit rey ga so that no one would pursue his technology except me but you have given me more than i could have hoped now i can take the prototype itself back to takara where i will develop it into a weapon all i have to do is wait here until the enterprise is convinced you are dead and leaves\nbut only if it works im not convinced that this met aphasic shield can withstand either the temperature or the radiation it would be exposed to\nfor which of course we have only your word\nyou would not be the first scientist to manipulate experimental data to his own advantage\nif or one would feel more comfortable if someone else flew the shuttle someone more objective\ni do not share your optimism doctorjob ril but if you wish to pilot the craft i would be more confident in your assessment of the shield than doctor rey gas\nwhom do you propose we sacrifice next\nyes personal research\nno one has denied there is potential in the idea\nare you accusing me of something\ni warned doctor rey ga that if he persisted with his slander he would pay the price\ni will not repeat his lies\nbe careful doctor insulting the honour of a klingon can be extremely dangerous\ni have heard enough accusations now i will have your silence\nsabotage\nhow would i know\nnoi did not goodbye doctor\ni found microcrystalline damage to the hull which confirms that your shield was breached by a burst of baryonic radiation\ni dont know\nthen maybe job ril ran into something in the corona which you didnt anticipate and your shield just wasnt able to protect him from it\ndoctor heres the result of the tissues can you asked for\ni dont understand doctor isnt it pretty clear that rey ga died from a plasma discharge\nyou think he was murdered\nwhy wont the ferengi allow it\nwho ever had something to gain from his death\ndoctor crusher what do you need the autopsy files for\ncomputer access autopsy files\ni assume youll need the files on doctor rey ga and job ril\ni can see how important this is to you\nis that an order doctor\ntoo bad your e not my boss now\nso what do we do now\nlets do it\nyes doctor recalibration complete\nnothing\ntheres something in the subdermal

star\nmister worf get a lock on him as soon as you can\nhow sit going\ndo you have any idea what it was\nwere the solar radiation levels high enough to kill him\nbeverly the answers will come\nyou know you ve been at this for hours you might think more clearly if you got a good nights sleep\nyour e doing it for doctor rey ga or yourself\nyour e the loneliest person in the world right now no one can say anything no one can do anything that will help and you think that it will never go away and your e right it wont but you can get used to it i know it doesnt feel like that now but you can\nbut by your own admission rey ga was a difficult man to understand isnt it possible that he was simply masking his feelings\ndo you have any evidence of that\nbeverly im afraid there will be no autopsy the family has already been contacted they insist that the body must not be touched until they perform the ferengi death ritual\nto the family thats irrelevant\nplease believe me theyre adamant we are scheduled to rendezvous with a ferengi ship in seventeen hours they will pick up rey gas body then im sorry there will be no autopsy\nthen you will have to find evidence some way other than an autopsy\ncome beverly\nwhat did you find\nyou most certainly should not i made it clear to you that the family would not allow it not only have you disobeyed my orders but youve interfered in the burial rituals of another culture youve put both of us in a very difficult position the family will have to be notified i dont doubt that they will react strongly if the ferengi government becomes

aphasic controls the system will activate automatically as you approach the star\nthanks to you doctor\nthis is an opportunity i would never have had without you and i promise you ill never forget it\nwell if there s anything im used to its scepticism after all a ferengi scientist is almost a contradiction in terms no dont deny it i know how the ferengi are regarded\nthe met aphasic shield is a breakthrough in technology many scientists have tried to develop it its only natural that there would be some resistance\nim really not interested in competition all i want is to be acknowledged respected as a scientist this invention will finally do that\nthe met aphasic shielding has begun to form\nthat should have no effect on the shuttle cabin\nthose are from the subspace field thats encapsulating the shuttle the levels are well within acceptable parameters\nyou see doctors met aphasic shielding is a reality doctorjob ril can you give us an estimate of the plasma turbulence\ndoctorjob ril\nno thats not possible\ni dont understand this shouldnt be happening\nrun another diagnostic on the flow regulator\nwhat about the field emitter coil has it maintained polarity\nthe radial force compensator\nno i dont understand it there must be something weve overlooked\nno thats not possible i anticipated every contingency\nmy shield was not at fault\ndoctor

going on mister data\nbeverly\nweve arranged for a shuttle to take you to starbase twenty three you can leave the ship at oh seven hundred hours tomorrow\nabout everything thats going on im sorry im sure it will all workout\nyou know the inquiry s just a formality and captain picard will do everything he can for you\nbut if you do anything foolish before that inquiry its not going to look good

harder on you\nbeverly im saying this to you as a friend\nno idea no ones filed a flightplan\nthats the justman the shuttle rey ga modified\nget a tractor beam on her\nfor give my scepticism doctor but your claims are somewhat extravagant protect a shuttle within a stars corona not even your own government believes it can be done\ni agree my own research into solar energy transfer suggests that vay tans corona is extremely unstable\ni do not believe the shield will ever work its very concept is flawed\nwhat reason would anyone have to kill him\ni see you are suggesting that i had such a motive\nbut since it wasnt successful it is illogical to conclude that i had such a motive isnt it\ncaptain im concerned about beverly ive tried several times to talk to her but shes been avoiding me\nthis entire experience has been\nthe solar radiation is interfering he must be at least five hundred thousand kilometres from the star before we can get a transporter lock\nperhaps he could not

believe\ndoes that mean you no longer believe this is the real kahless\ni am curious do you still think the real kahless will return someday or has this experience only deepened the spiritual crisis which originally sent you to bore th\ni understand your dilemma i once had what could be considered a crisis of the spirit\nyes the starfleet officers who first activated me on omicron theta told me i was an android nothing more than a sophisticated machine with human form however i realised that if i were simply a machine i could never be anything else i could never grow beyond my programming i found that difficult to accept so i chose to believe that i was a person that i had the potential to be more than a collection of circuits and sub processors it is a belief which i still hold\ni made a leap of faith\nkahless i see kahles she is standing before me with a sword he wants something me he wants me he wants me to go with him\nit is kahless\nvery well\nwhere is he picard\ni am referring to the filthy pah tk who is using his name\nwhat have you learned about him so far\nwhat kind of medical analysis have you made do you have any theories about his true origin\nwhat kind of fools do you have working for you picard the imposters been a board for nearly a day\nand have him begin spreading his poisonous lies through a ship of loyal klingons never\nkahless has been dead for a thousand years but the idea of kahless is still alive have you ever fought an idea picard it has no weapon to destroy nobody to kill the idea of kahless return must be stopped here now or it will travel through the empire like a wave and leave nothing but destruction behind\nbut how how can this be\nit will be war you are not a fool worf do you really think that every klingon in the empire will bend his knee and grovel before this man just because ko roth says he is kahless\ni will not hand over the empire tokoro th because of one test\nof course it is ko roth open your eyes ko roth and the other guardians have always opposed me this is nothing more than a ploy for them to finally seize power even now there are warriors on my own ship who want to see kahless there are others who believe he is an imposter the divisions are already forming\ndont you see this is exactly why they want you to join them because your brother sits on the council and your voice carries weight in the empire they want you to influence others to follow them worf we fought together once side by side to keep the empire from being torn apart will you standby and let these impostors destroy all that we fought so hard to protect renounce him worf stand with me and we can hold the empire together\nkoro this ee that not all fools die young\nwhat was his name\nif you were really there you should be able to tell us the name of the man outside the walls describe him to us what was he wearing how tall was he what colour were his eyes\ni oppose you i say you are not kahless and i will not bend my knee to you as long as i can draw a breath or pick up a blade\nkahless the greatest warrior of them all\na clone\ndid you really think you would get away with this kind of fraud koro thi will have you and this abomination put to death\nwhat he s not real you just said so\ni do not care what they think\nbut when they find out the truth\nwhat are you saying that i should just hand over the empire\nthere hasnt been an emperor in three centuries\nand what will we tell the people about their new emperor that he appeared in a cave or a laboratory\nand if i refuse to go along with this\nwhat do you say about this ko roth\nvor chad oh bagh kahless\ni am kahless and i have returned\ni have returned you doubt me who here knows the story of how this sword was forged\ni went into the mountains all the way to the volcano at krista k there i cut off a lock of my hair and thrust it into the river of molten rock which poured from the summit the hair began to burn then i plunged it into the lake of lus or and twisted it into this sword and after i used it to kill the tyrant mo lori gave it a name bat leth the sword of honour\ni have returned because there is a great need in my people they fight among themselves in petty wars and corrupt the glory of the klingon spirit they have lost their way but it is not too late i have returned and i will lead my people again\nwhat is it you are doing\ntricorder is it a weapon\nto see if i was real proceed use your tricorder well\nwhat else could ibe\nso you are a sceptic worf i like that\nwe have met before i appeared to you in a vision in the caves of no mat you were just a child then i told you that you would do something that no klingon had ever done before you still do not believe it is me do you worf\nthat is a beginning\ndo not worry we are on the threshold of a new era for our people klingons from all over the empire will flock to my banner yet something still weighs heavy on the brow of the son of mog hare you contemplating yet another question for me after three days i am beginning to wonder if you know how to do anything else\ndo not forget that a leader need not answer questions of those he leads it is enough that he says to do a thing and they will do it if he says to run they run if he says to fight they fight if he says to die they die\nnuqchataknuq\nwhat is wrong is there only anger and bloodlust in your souls is that all that is left in the klingon heart we do not fight merely to spill blood but to enrich the spirit look at us two warriors locked in battle fighting for honour how can you not sing for all to hear we are klingons yes let it outlet the joy in your heart be heard we are klingons\nwe are klingons\nwhat is this test\nperhaps it is time to settle the doubts of those who still do not believe i will allow this test\nit has been so long since i have tasted any food or drink there are many things i have forgotten\ni do not have those answers i am merely a traveller someone who has journeyed back and forth between this world and the next while i am in this form i know only about this world and there is much work for me to do in this world and you will be part of it worf\nit was your purity of heart that summoned me back from stovokorandkoroth has told me about the respect you have earned in the federation and the empire i want you to have a place at my side as we restore honour to our people let me tell you about this new empire we will forge\nlong ago a storm was heading toward the city of quin lat the people sought protection within the walls all except one man who remained outside i went to him and asked what he was doing i am not afraid he said i will not hide my face behind stone and mortar i will stand before the wind and make it respect mei honoured his choice and went inside the next day the storm came and the man was killed the wind does not respect a fool do not stand before the wind gowron\nwhat\ni do not remember it was long ago and in another lifetime what matters is i have returned to restore faith and hope to my people to lead them back to the way of honour and the glory that was once theirs and can be again is that what you oppose gowron\na good try gowron but not enough\nyou have no joy gowron is your heart so filled of distrust and suspicion that youve forgotten what it is to be truly klingon\ni am kahles siam the strongest the bravest warrior\nwhat do you mean\nthe first kahless\nwhat is a clone\nso i did not do any of the things that i remember i was never at the city of quin latin ever went to the krista t volcano\nit is acceptable\njoin with me gowron let us usher in this new era together\nfarewell worf\nwhats wrong you should be proud of what youve accomplished\nyou doubt the real kahless will return one day you doubt that he is still waiting for you inst ov ok or kahless left us all of us a powerful legacy a way of thinking and acting that makes us klingon if his words hold wisdom and his philosophy is honourable what does it really matter if he returns what is important is that we follow his teachings perhaps the words are more important than the manqaplasonofmogh\nwe are klingons\nkahless\nkahless\nit is a powerful vision you have had div ok kahless wants you to join him in sto v ok or you are only nineteen and yet your place among the honoured dead is already secure take him back to his chamber let him sleep\nyour e leaving us\nwhat is the story of the promise worf\nthe people wept they did not want him to go\nso here we are on a world circling that distant point of light it has been fifteen centuries since he made that promise and still we wait what are ten days in the life of one klingon compared to that is the son of mo gh really so easily discouraged you came to us seeking answers but this is a place of questions open your heart to kahless ask him your questions let him speak to you with your mind unclouded by doubt or hesitation only then can you find what you are looking for if you can not do that then perhaps you should return to your starship\nwhat are you doing who are you\nyou know the story of the sword is known only to the high clerics it was never written down so that if he returned we could be sure it was kahless\nvorchadohbaghkkah less\ngowron knows that his days are nearly over now he comes crawling aboard with some kind of test\ngowron does not care about what is sacred\nkahless may i present gowron leader of the high council\nno\neverything will be all right we will say that gowron used a dishonourable tactic in his fight with kahless\nwe do not need to hear any more from the son of mo gh none of this would have happened if you hadnt brought them together\nyou have said enough now get out\nthe problems with your memory are the result of the way you returned\nwe the guardians have been awaiting your return for centuries but we did not have the technology to bring you back until now we were able to use an organic sample of the first kahless to give you life\nyou are not just a copy we gave you more than the body of kahless\nyou were not awakened until we transported you into the cave and you appeared to worf before that time you were unconscious in a laboratory where we accelerated your growth corrected any genetic anomalies that occurred gave you the wisdom and memories that\nyou are twisting the truth\nit is not a lie genetically he is kahless and he is needed by our people you know better than anyone the corruption and dishonour that has destroyed the empire they need him\nhow do you know that this is not the way the prophesy was to be fulfilled who is to say that what we did was wrong\nworf you can not tell gowron of this\nall right but consider this if you tell gowron what we have told you it will destroy him and with him the last chance to restore hope to our people its your choice\nthen what are you proposing worf\nthe title is meaningless without the power to back it up\nwhat i say is unimportant\non your feet lieutenant\nmister worf your personal affairs are strictly your own concern until they interfere with the operation of this ship you have now crossed that line as your captain i want to know exactly what is going on\ntry\ndoes this have something to do with the klingons you rescued from car ray a four\nis that what your e doing here trying to recapture those feelings\nits a pity you didnt try using the holodeck instead of setting fire to your quarters\nhave you lost your faith inst ov ok or\ninexcusable and understandable it may be that what you are looking for can not be found here on the enterprise perhaps you need to immerse yourself in klingon beliefs in order to discover whether they can hold any truths for you is there something you can do is there somewhere you could go to explore your faith more fully\nbore this only twelve days from hereby shuttle as of this moment mister worf you are on leave\nbut when you set foot on this ship again i expect you to perform your duties like a starfleet officer\nand mister worf i hope you find what you re looking for\nlook we have no reason to rule out anything we are not ordered to investigate the origins of our guest nor tell anyone what they should believe we are simply to transport kahless to the homeworld and while he s here with us he will be treated as an honoured guest\nwelcome aboard gowron\ni assume that your e referring to kahless\nwell the person in question is in his quarters at the moment\nwe havent done any analysis\nif you wanted to run tests on kahless you should have sent a klingon ship for him\nif he really is an imposter then you have nothing to worry about\nso gowron has come on board in order to test your claim\nhe has brought a knife with him a knife is was supposed to be stained with the blood of kahless\nhe wants to run a genetic analysis on a sample of the blood and on you that should tell us if there is a biological match now if you agree to the test i will make the enterprise facilities available to ensure that it is conducted impartially\ndata interesting night\nsorry i missed it\nvery well\nisnt lieutenant worf scheduled to replace ensign to rig an\nhes never late riker to lieutenant worf computer locate lieutenant worf\nsome things wrong mister data you have the bridge security team meet me on deck seven section twenty five baker\ncomputer override security lock on this door authorisation riker alpha six zero\nworf no offence but i have trouble believing that the mani that escorted to deck eight is supernatural\naye sir\nno one knows it is not written in the sacred texts\ngowron is the leader of the council he commands the entire defence force if he chooses to oppose you\nwe do not have to prove anything to gowron\ngowron has brought the knife of ki rom no one is permitted to remove it from the sacred vault\nthat he cheated\ndo not think about what happened you must think of the future of the empire\nwe found a way to imprint specific information in your neuro synaptic patterns we gave you memories and not just any memories we gave you the experiences of kahless as written in the sacred texts\nto rvalukdosheltorvariker\nenter\ncaptain\nsir\nit is difficult to explain\never since i returned from the car ray a system i have felt empty\nthey were young they knew nothing of their heritage so while i was there i tried to teach them teach them about their people their culture i told them our ancient stories instructed them in our customs explained our beliefs and then i told them about kahless how he united our people long ago how he gave us strength and honour and how he promised to return one day and lead us again\nyes i was trying to summon a vision of kahless\nusing the holodeck would not have been appropriate everything had to be real if kahless were to appear but all this was is nothing he did not come to me i gave to q and the others a belief in sto v ok or the life which lies beyond this life where kahless awaits us when i saw the power of their beliefs i began to question the strength of my own and i found it wanting\nto lose something one must first possess it i am not sure i ever had a true belief but i should not have allowed it to interfere with my duties my behaviour has been\nbore th the followers of kahless await his return there to klingons there is no more sacred place\nthank you sir\nyes sir\nthank you sir\nit has been ten days ko roth i have had no visions i have received no insight there is nothing here for me\nwhen kahless had united our people and gave them the laws of honour he saw that his work was done so one night he gathered his belongings and departed for the edge of the city to say goodbye\nthen kahless said you are klingons you need no one but yourselves i will go now to sto v ok or but i promise one day i will return then kahless pointed to a star in the sky and said look for me there on that point of light\nto rvalukdosheltorvaluk\ni see kahless\nyou are real\ni was getting my tricorder\nnono it is a tool i intended to use it to see\nyou are klingon\nthere are many possibilities a shapeshifter a holographic projection\nhow do you know my name\ni want to believe\nquestions are the beginning of wisdom the mark of a true warrior\nif the commander is worthy of their trust\nno\nthere is another possibility he could be the real kahles she may have actually returned as he promised\ni did not say that he is i merely think we should not completely reject the possibility\nit is not an empirical matter it is a matter of faith\nperhaps some other time commander i do not believe i can provide much insight at this minute\nit is true kahless has returned\ni am sorry our replicators do not do justice to klingon war nog\nkahless may i ask you about death and sto v ok or tell me what awaits us beyond this life\nme\nit will be glorious\nhe is kahless your own test proved it\nit is not ko roth it is\nbut it does not have to be this way we could all join together and welcome kahless as a united people\nyou do not understand kahless is our future only with his help can we revive the pure warriors within ourselves listen to him gowron open your heart hear his words he will restore your faith as he has restored mine give him a chance to lift your spirit and cleanse your heart before you take up arms\nko roth\nthat is a lie he did not\nthere is no future here no glorious new era for our people gowron was right you did not know the name of the man who faced the storm you do not even know what real war nog tastes like and you certainly are not the greatest warrior of all whoever you are you are not kahless\nyou are using the name of kahless for some twisted game for that alone you should die and if you do not tell me what you have done i will kill you right here\na clone he is a clone\na being created in a laboratory by genetic material taken from another being you are a copy a fraud\nthey grew you in a test tube like some kind of fungus and programmed you like a machine\nyou talk to me of truth you who have brought to life this lie and called it kahless\nthey do not need a false god\ni am i will not let this fraud continue\ndo not give me orders ko roth\nthen they are fools\nyes\ni do not know\nyou\nhow did you come to your decision\nthe man who appeared to me on bore this not kahles she is a clone\nyes\nit does not matter gowron you will still not be able to stand against him\ni said he was not the kahless but in the minds of our people he can be just as powerful as kahless even now two members of your own crew are sitting on our holodeck waiting for him to return\nbut hey are not alone like many of our people they need something to believe in just like i did something larger than themselves something that will give their lives meaning they need kahless\nit will not matter gowron despite the facts they will still believe they will make a leap of faith and there will be others just like them not everyone but enough to plunge the empire into civil war if you oppose them\nno that would be unwise as well\nyou were right about one thing ko roth our people are becoming decadent and corrupt they need moral leadership kahless can be that leader as emperor\nthe political power will remain with the high council kahless would be a figurehead but he will have the ability to rally the people to lead by example to guide them in spiritual matters\nreal power comes from within the heart you would have the power to mold the klingon heart you could return them to honourable ways according to the original teachings of kahless which are within you it would be a great challenge if you have the courage to accept it\nwe will tell them the truth all of the truth but we will tell them that even if he is not the real kahles she is the rightful heir to kahless\nthen my brother and those who support him on the council will fight you and i will fight you and the empire will fall back into civil war\ngoodbye\ni went to bore th to find my faith for a time i thought i had but my heart is empty again i do not know what to believe\nqap la kahless back to the

    "episode 148": "aye sir standby\nsir\nwhat was that all about\nlooks like you fractured your arm a few years ago 2\ngenetically hes indistinguishable from commander riker\ni dont think so theres no genetic drift\nthats why i compared their brains cans brain organisation patterns areas unique as fingerprints except for minor minor differences theirs are identical\nno theyre determined by experience mostly from early childhood\nwhat happened to the second beam\nup until that moment you were the same person\nthen what happened\nthen what happened\nim just asking\nhe snot will he is will but you know what i mean\ndeanna just because things turned out the way they did between you and commander riker doesnt mean you shouldnt let things between you and lieutenant riker take their own course\ni thought thats that why you brought it up\nwell i think ill call it a day\nbye2\ndata to commander riker\ncommander you are needed on the bridge\nyes sir it appears we will be able to transport to the surface sooner than anticipated\nno sir using the potemkin s transport logs from the original evacuation commander laforge and i were able to modify the transporters\nthe transporters are considerably more efficient than those used on the potemkin eight years ago\nninety seven minutes sir\ntwenty six minutes after that the distortion field will re phase\nthe planets proximity to its sun will create two additional transport windows in the next three days\nit will have to be sir the next transport window will not occur for another eight years when the planets orbit will bring it close enough to the sun to de phase the distortion field\naye sir\ncommander\ncommander someone is approaching a humanoid forty metres due east and closing\nmay i ask how you go there 2\nwhy did you not return to the potemkin with the other s2\nan interesting approach he must have been planning to reintegrate the two patterns in the transport buffer\nmany of its components have been removed apparently lieutenant riker used them to keep the stations radiation shield operational\nwe have less than three minutes left 2\nthe game is five card draw no limit ante please\nlieutenant 2\nmister worf\ncommander\ndealer takes two you control the bet lieutenant 2\ni will call 2\ndealer folds2\nlieutenant i am curious about something if you met a double of yourself would you have difficulty interacting with him\nwhy\nbut commander riker and lieutenant riker are yet they seem to have trouble getting along with each another i have found that humans value their uniqueness that sense that they are different from everyone else the existence of a double would preclude that feeling could that be the source of the friction\nthey have restored the servo link to the core we can begin downloading the database\nis hunted the database to the main core underneath the station\nive accessed the command pathways the interlink pathways are functioning now\napparently there was a massive energy surge in the distortion field around the planet just at the moment you tried to beam out the transporter chief tried to compensate by initiating a second containment beam\nactually it wasnt really necessary commander rikers pattern maintained its integrity with just the one containment beam he made it back to the ship just fine\nthe transporter chief shut it down but somehow it was reflected back to the surface\nthe containment beam must have had the exact same phase differential as the distortion field\nthats the thing both you were both materialised from a complete pattern\nlaforge here\ncan i help you counsellor\nphase distortion is dropping the second transport window opens in forty two seconds\nthirtysix minutes sir\njeanlucpicard2\ni hope you understand our need to verify your claim 2\ncould there be some sort of cloning involved here\nbut its not conclusive\nbut cant brain patterns be cloned\nhow can two grown men share the same childhood experiences it just doesnt make any sense 2\nlieutenant our chief engineer is checking the transport logs of the potemkin perhaps that will shed some light on the matter dont worry we will get to the bottom of this and in the meantime you will be taken to your quarters try and make yourself as comfortable as possible 2\nand another william riker materialised there\nbut of course as you and lieutenant riker have lived very different lives for the past eight years you are now very different people i suppose its a little like meeting someones twin but no matter how strange it may seem to us we now have two will rikers on board and as lieutenant riker will be with us for several days i think we should do everything we can to make him comfortable and welcome\ncan it be repaired at least enough to access the database\nperhaps he can help us\nhe was alone down there for a long time im hesitant to let him go back until he s been evaluated\nthank you counsellor 2\ncome\nyes number one come in\nlieutenant riker has been to see me to talk about the away mission he believes that the only way to retrieve the database is by directly accessing the main core underneath the station\nhe said that he was down there recently he seemed confident that it could be done safely\nbut if it doesnt work we wont have another chance for eight years\ngiven the importance of the data i think that its worth the risk\nim sure that lieutenant riker will be happy to help you with that\nthank you thankyouverymuch thank you thankyouverymuch any requests tonight\nany request\nladies and gentlemen nightbird one two\ngo ahead\non my way saved by the bell\nyou wanted to see me mister data\nis the planets distortion field re phasing sooner than we predicted\nso we can be am through a higher distortion field\nthats a good thing i almost didnt make it off the surface when can we get started\nhow long will the transport window be open\nthat doesnt give us much time to retrieve the database\nlets hope that s enough\nokay notify the away team that were going in ahead of schedule ill tell the captain\nthis is different than i remember the place was a mess when we left\nsomeone was here\nwho are you 2\nwho are you\nim commander william riker from the federation starship enterprise 2\nthats not possible im will riker\neight years ago ile date am to evacuate this station\nwhat ship were you on2\nthe potemkin\ni was the last one out the distortion field must have interfered with the transport they lost their signal lock on me when i tried to contact the ship i couldnt get through the interference if you check with starfleet im sure they will have recorded that i was lost on that day\nthats not what happened i was the last one out and i made it back to the potemkin 2\nyou dont believe me\nits not that we dont believe you its just hard to see how both stories could be true would you be willing have our doctor check youout2\nof course\nmister worf take him directly to sickbay and notify the captain once your e on board lets get to work\ni was doing some repairs under the station when an earthquake hit i got caught in a rockslide i had to set it myself\nlieutenant will riker\nyes sir\ni am will riker i dont know who or what made it back to the potemkin that day but it wasnt me\ni will the replicators on the station havent worked for a long time ago its been a while since ive had a decent meal doctor\nhow was the second pattern able to maintained its integrity\nwhich one of them is real\nwe still have the problem of retrieving the database the computer on the station is not completely operational\nwithout knowing what he did that ll be tough\ncome in\nimz adi\ni never thought id see you again\nyour e on board because of him\nlike yesterday the jan aran falls on beta zed\nand we were going to meet on risa six weeks later\ni know\ni know that too for exceptional valour during the evacuation of the research station on nerval a four i looked at his service record\ni had a lot of time on my hands when i was down on that station there were days i felt so alone i thought i might lose my mind do you know how i made it through i thought if i hung on for more day they d rescue me may be id see you again i guess things dont always work out the way you expect them to\nthanks\ni reconfigured that computer so many times they probably cant make heads or tails of it id be happy to help\nabsolutely\ndeanna i know its been a long time since we ve been together and i know your feelings have changed mine havent i cant just give up id like to be with you again\nhow long will we have lieutenant\ncomputer locate lieutenant\ncancel inquiry\nim sorry i was\ni guess its been a while since youve had to punch a clock lets go energise 2\nive shutdown most of the consoles to save power i rerouted just about everything through here\ncheck out the primary system see if you can get some power to the rest of these consoles 2\nis hunted the database to the main core underneath the station\ncan we access it from here 2\ntheres been a lot of seismic activity over the years if the servo links were damaged we may not be able to ill try to tap into the command pathways you see if you can access and disable the file server\nyou know ive been thinking we should probably let dad know what happened 2\nim sure hell be thrilled to know there are two of us now\nactually he and i have been able to patch a few things up2\nive been able to get by for a long time without seeing him im not about to start now what made you contact him\ni didnt he came onboard the enterprise to brief me when i was offered the aries2\nwhat did he say when you turned down your own command\nhe couldnt understand why ididit2\nfor once he and i agree on something\nive accessed the command pathways the interlink pathways are functioning now\nsee if that did the trick no its not working 2\nthe servo link must be damaged were going to have to go under the station and access the core directly\nill stay here ill be finished by the time the third window opens\nits too dangerous our scans show the caverns are unstable 2\nive been down there dozens of times i know my way around\nwell come back during the third window well bring a new eps coupling and try to access the core from another console up here riker to enterprise\nwere ready to be amout2\nyou go ahead ill be finished by the time you get back\nhold it i gave you an order lieutenant\nthe jan aran falls\ni made it a couple of years ago down on the station\nyou should have seen the first two it took a while to get a fine enough beam out of the phaser\ncan you stay and talk i wanted to remember our last night together\ngreat strange for a long time i did whatever i wanted whenever i wanted its been hard taking orders again\nbut i guess ill have to get used to it if i want to get my career going again\nremember im the one who wanted to make captain by the time i was thirty five im a little behind schedule ill admit that\ni do things are a little more complicated than i had planned but there s nothing going to stand in the way of my getting what i want\nthanks you dont know how many times i thought about you about us for weeks after the evacuation i kept thinking they d find a way through the distortion field and come back for mei even thought wed meet on risa like we planned but days went by and nobody came then i realised why they thought that i had been killed in the beam out no one came down because they thought there was no one to come down for so i figured that they d had a memorial service for me somehow that made me feel better\nyou were there all dressed in black very flattering on you by the way\nsometimes i would look up into the sky and id think if i tried hard enough i could make you feel my presence that if i could let you know that i was alive maybe you d wait for me i know it sounds crazy but there were times when i couldve sworn what ami talking about\nyou didnt have to ik new\nyou wanted to see me sir\nthe seismic activity makes those caverns very unstable in my opinion its too risky\ntheres a good chance we will be able to retrieve the database from one of the consoles inside the station\nlieutenant rikers plan is more dangerous but it does have a better chance of succeeding\nill look over the schematics and ill draw up a mission plan\nill talk to him\nlieutenant 2\nsir\ni just met with the captain about your mission recommendation i would appreciate it if next time you came to me first 2\ni tried talking to you yesterday on the station you wouldnt hear me out\ni heard you lieutenant i rejected your plan 2\nmay i ask what the captain decided\nthe captain has decided to go with your recommendation but thats not the point 2\nisnt it\nif you think im coming down on you because the captain overruled me think again i happen to disagree with his decision but he is my commanding officer and i follow his orders just so theres no confusion i am your commanding officer and i expect you to do the same if you cant theres no place for you onmyawayteam2\nyes sir\nthere will be a meeting in the observation lounge at fourteen hundred hours to draw up a mission plan\nsome form of taichi chuan\nthe forms are very similar do that move again\ntaichi chuan its called the crane block now lets try something else 2\nwhat was that called mister w orfs a very good teacher\nif you want to be with him you dont have to ask my permission its the look in your eyes i recognise it you used to have it for me\nflattered sort of\never since he came on board i find myself thinking about the choice you and i made\ndome a favour be careful\nthats not what im talking about if he had gotten off the planet instead of me dont you think he would have made the same choices that i made i just dont want you to be hurt again\nfull boat kings over id like to thank you both for your very generous contributions\ncome in 2\ni thought you d be alone excuse

memory record of the entire lecture counsellor i can repeat the portions you missed if you\nit was not painful\nmy memory record does not indicate a pause or disruption during that time period my internal chronometer and the ships computer are both perfectly synchronised there does not appear to be a temporal discrepancy\nyou were motionless for three minutes eleven seconds\naye sir\ncaptain may i see you\nthe enterprise is not responding to our hails\nno sir\naye sir\nwe have an engine failure warning in the\nattitude control has been restored\ngeordi i believe i have an explanation according to the plasma conversion sensor the starboard engine has been in continuous operation for forty seven days\ncaptain i am detecting a temporal disturbance intersecting the table it appears that within the disturbance time is moving at an accelerated rate approximately fifty times faster than normal the disturbance is spherical in shape it is extending outward from the hull approximately seventeen metres from the ship\nit does not appear to be affected\ncourse plotted adjust pitch to twenty seven point three degrees set heading one eight zero\nmark zero\nwe are clearing the phenomenon\nall stop\nthere is another temporal disturbance directly behind us\nwithin each disturbance it appears that time is moving at a different rate\nthe fragmentation effect continues along a heading of two seven zero mark one five\nthe fragmentation effect is increasing\nthe enterprise and the warbird both appear to be trapped within one of the temporal fragments\nsensors can not penetrate the subspace field i am unable to scan within the vessels\nit is impossible to tell from a visual inspection however it appears to be focused on the warbirds engineering section\nthat would be inadvisable sir in each of the three instances we came into contact with one of the temporal fragments we were integrated into its time frame\nthe emergency transporter armbands contain a types even phase discriminator it should be possible to reconfigure their subspace emitters\ni will attempt to narrow the field sir\ncounsellor\ncaptain the equipment is no longer functioning however the information currently displayed indicates that there was a massive power surge in engineering\ndata to captain picard\nplease come to engineering immediately it is urgent\ncaptain i believe i have found the cause of the power surge there is a warp core breach in progress\nit is the flashpoint of a warp core explosion and it is expanding\nwe were incorrect siri have determined that time is moving forward at an infinitesimal rate\nour initial conclusion was based on our observations of the crew a warp core breach moves at a much faster rate the motion of the cloud is within my visual detection threshold at its current expansion rate it will consume the enterprise in approximately nine hours seventeen minutes\nit is no longer a question of stopping it sir the explosion has already occurred the fact that it is moving slowly changes nothing\nno however the console displays indicate a power transfer in progress between the enterprise and the romulan ship at the moment time decelerated that is why there is a second beam between the two ships\nperhaps we should go aboard the romulan ship the answer to that question may\ncaptain\nin much the same way deep sea divers experience nitrogen narcosis you experienced a form of temporal narcosis\nthis is highly unusual the crew is not at battlestations the ship is on evacuation alert\nperhaps the warbird was trying to destroy the enterprise\ngeordi the engine core is completely inactive\nit appears to be a highly focused aperture in the spacetime continuum its energy signature matches that of the temporal fragments we observed earlier however it is approximately one point two million times as intense i believe this may be the origin of the temporal fragmentation\ni am not certain they exhibit a complex bioelectric patterns very possibly organic\nfrom the molecular configuration it appears the aperture is beginning to fluctuate i believe\ni believe my tricorder emissions caused the temporal aperture to activate i suggest we avoid exposing it to any\nfurther energy emissions\nthey may have been attempting to eject their engine core\nwe must get him to the runabout\nyes but i am getting unusual readings from his bios can i am not sure he is a romulan\nhis cellular structure does not conform to any known species his bioelectric patterns are in a state of temporal flux i do not believe that this being is native to our time continuum\ncorrect sir\nthis is a bio spectral analysis of the temporal aperture the organic readings originated from these dark spots\nits bioelectric patterns are similar to those of the aliens however they are significantly less complex its cellular structure appears to be in a state of mitosis\nit is possible if i could further scan the aperture it might be possible to\nhis molecular structure is destabilising\ncaptain i believe the aliens mistook the artificial singularity which the romulans use in their engine for a natural one a black hole they tried to use it as a nest\nwhen the power transfer came into contact with the alien nest i believe it disrupted the spacetime continuum\ni estimate the core breach will consume the enterprise in approximately seven hours two minutes\nno sir we would have to surround the core with a subspace isolation field it is not possible to generate a field of that magnitude from the runabout\ncorrect sir\ni could attempt to re modulate the tricorder s delta band emissions it should be possible to better control the temporal aperture\ni have reached engineering captain standing by\ninitiating tricorder emissions\ncaptain\nthe warp core breach has been reversed sir\nayesir2\ndo not initiate that power transfer\nwe must shut it down\ncomputer place a level three containment field around the warp core\ni was attacked by another alien siri was unable to prevent the power transfer it can not be disengaged sir a core breach is again imminent\nthe core breach has been prevented sir\nthe alien who attacked me has vanished sir\njudging from the residual temporal fluctuations i believe they have returned to their own time continuum\ncome in\nspot is sleeping sir why do you ask\nunderstood sir\nrecent events have compelled me to study how humans perceive the passage of time for example i have often heard people comment that time seems to pass more slowly in one instance or more quickly in another in reality the actual passage of time remains fixed\ni have been testing the aphorism a watched pot never boils i have boiled the same amount of water in this kettle sixty two times in some cases i have ignored the kettle in others i have watched it intently in every instance the water reaches its boiling point in precisely fifty one points even seconds it would appear that i am not capable of perceiving time any differently than my internal chronometer\nsir\nthank you siri will try that\nim sorry siri already have\nthe transfer beam is at saturation sir it cant be disengaged\nthats a very good impression of doctor mizan\nhes notorious but he really is an expert on interspecies mating practices\nhow did you enjoy the rest of the conference counsellor\nwhy didnt anybody tell him\nwell i had a great time the warp energy symposium was fascinating i actually had an opportunity to touch a plasma field\nit was incredible i could feel the plasma moving up my arm it was warm and oh there was this amazing tingling sensation that\nmoved through my chest it was incredible it was like taking a bath in pure energy\noh no counsellor is there something wrong\nwell our bio scans check out there are no physiological anomalies if something did happen it didnt leave any biological traces\ndata lets run a ship wide diagnostic maybe we missed something\nwait a second this is weird\ni had the tricorder run a comparison between the bios can i took of you earlier and the one i took just now in the time between the two scans you should have aged twenty three minutes but according to your cellular decay levels youve only aged twenty minutes\ni dont know sir its as if for counsellor troi for three minutes time just stopped\nill check the sensor logs see if i can find anything\nthe starboard nacelle just cut out\nthe starboard antimatter pod is completely drained the fuel reserves are empty\nno sir the containment field is intact all engine systems are operational the fuel is just gone\nforty seven days nah lets check that sensor it must be malfunctioning\nthat would cover the starboard nacelle no wonder it used up all its fuel\naye sir\nlateral thrusters online data plot a course away from the disturbance\nmake sure it doesnt come in contact with our other engine\ngot it reversing at fifteen metres per second\nwhat was that\ncaptain\ni think you d better come take a look at this\nthe sensors are picking up temporal disturbances throughout the region different configurations different sizes theyre everywhere\nits almost as if something has shattered the spacetime continuum\nthats the direction of the enterprise\nwell have to limit our manoeuvring speed to one half impulse but i think we can do it\nthese are the coordinates\nive got the long range sensors on maximum sir theres no sign of the enterprise but i am picking up a faint reading possibly metallic its difficult to tell the energy levels are practically nonexistent\naye sir\nslowing to one eighth impulse\nthe fragments seem to be converging at about this point id say were looking at the centre of the temporal disturbances\nthe warbird doesnt look to have sustained any damage at all i wonder if the enterprise even had time to get off a shot\nif we beamed aboard the enterprise wed be frozen in time just like they are\npossibly wed need an awfully sensitive phase discriminator in order to moderate that kind of field\nyeah yeah that would certainly isolate us from the effects of the other timeframe but if we wanted to interact with that environment wed have to restrict the field it would have to be practically skintight\ncaptain i think this is going to work but its going to take some time\nweve channelled all communications through the subspace relays in the armbands that way well be able to be in continual communication\nabout an hour may be less dont worry ill monitor you very carefully\nweve created an artificial pocket of time around you so its probably playing tricks with your equilibrium it might take a little while to get used to it let me know if it gets any worse\naye sir energising\nlaforge here sir\nid rather not captain we ve got limited power and your isolation fields consume a lot of energy\nit looks like you werent completely protected from the effects of the other time continuum the neuro physical stress must ve been overwhelming\ni dont think so id say the best thing we can do right now is to be careful limit our exposure to their time frame id say no longer than ten minutes per trip and we should stick probably stick together while were there just in case\ntake a look at this theres an energy feedback returning through the transfer beam its probably what overloaded the enterprises engines and caused the core breach\ni dont think so according to this the romulans were actually trying to shut down the power transfer\ndata why dont we take a look at their engine readouts\nlets take a closer look\ni think weve found the problem\norganic\nyes captain it looks to me like they were trying to stop whatever was happening here\ni think so captain wait some things not right here data was this man always standing right here\nwell it was little better at the physiognomy workshop doctor vass binder gave an hour long dissertation on the ionisation effect of warp nacelles before he realised that the topic was supposed to be psychology\nthere was no opportunity there was no pause he just kept talking in one long incredibly unbroken sentence moving from topic to topic so that no one had a chance to interrupt it was really quite hypnotic\nhow long did it appear to you that we were frozen\nlets go through all this again you were sitting there the rest of us were here describe the exact moment when we appeared to freeze\ndid you sense something from any of us at that time any unusual emotion\nor there is another possibility counsellor this could be nothing more than simple\nare you all right counsellor\nit appears to be the same effect that you described in us do you remember anything\nhow do you account for this discrepancy\nmister data contact the enterprise tell commander riker to meet us at the rendezvous point as soon as possible have him scan the region for temporal anomalies\nare we within sensor range\nincrease speed to the rendezvous coordinates\nreport\nfull stop what happened\nis there a fuel containment leak\nill check the fuel consumption logs\nmy hand\nthe pain is going away\nit happened when i reached for the bowl of fruit\ncheck the hull integrity\nmister laforge see if you can move us away from the disturbance\nyes mister laforge\ncan we navigate around these fragments\nget us to the enterprise\nperhaps the enterprise has been delayed\ntake us to it\nthere she is\nmister data\nscan for life signs\ntheres a second energy beam its coming from the enterprise deflector array do you have any idea what that could be\nwere not going to be able to determine anything from here we need to get onboard the enterprise\nwell we have to find some way of staying unfrozen mister laforge what about a subspace force field like the one we used on devi dia two could something like that protect us from the effects of the temporal fragment\nmister data\nwell mister laforge it would seem that time is something we have plenty of\nbeam us directly to the enterprise bridge\nthere are three romulans all of them with disruptors one at conn there are none of our security officers on the bridge they must have taken us by surprise it appears that we can move objects in this time frame\nim wary about making changes in this time continuum until we understand more about whats going on\nsecurity teams had just been sent to transporter room three and to sickbay counsellor will you go to sickbay and investigate mister data go to main engineering see if you can determine the cause of that power surge ill be in transporter room three mister laforge\nwill you lock on to our signals i want you to beam counsellor troi to\nunderstood well use the jefferies tube lets go\nno well find an alternative route lets go back up\nexcuse me mister worf\ncounsellor take a look at this it appears that mister worf had just beamed these three onboard and according to this three other romulans had been beamed directly to sickbay just seconds earlier\nwhat are we doing transporting romulans onboard the ship in the middle of a battle they dont have any weapons and that one looks injured if they were part of an invasion then why are they unarmed it doesnt make any sense\ngo ahead mister data\nwhats the problem mister data\nexpanding i thought that time was suspended on this ship\nis there anything we can do to stop it\nastonishing to see it frozen like this\nmy head oh dizzy i cant no no\ncan we modify the subspace isolators to give us better protection\nvery well well the first step is to find out why the enterprise was transferring power to the romulan ship i think we should begin our search in the romulan engine room counsellor you spent several days on a romulan vessel you probably know more about the layouts than anyone here perhaps\nyes very well i will monitor your progress from here but just remember ten minutes no more\nwhen time resumed did you observe any activity in the engine room that might\nsuggest what the romulans were doing\nmister laforge\nfrom where you are can you determine what s happening on the romulan bridge\nmister data you said that you found organic matter in the temporal aperture\nid like to take a closer look at those readings\nthey appear to contain some sort of energy patterns can you isolate one of them and magnify\nthey look like cellular clusters\ndata this could be some sort of embryo\nwho are you\nwho were in danger\nhow were your young trapped in the core\nthe enterprise responded and found the warbird suffering from an apparent engine failure and they attempted a power transfer\ndid you who attacked the enterprise\nare there any others like you here\ndo you know where he is could he help us restore normal time\nis it possible to lock on to the core itself beam it into space\nmister data when you scanned the temporal aperture with your tricorder it caused time to move forwards and then back again\nwhat if we could reverse that process cause time move backwards and then forwards\nthe breach never happens\nmake it so if this works we may not have much time to prevent the power transfer well have to decide precisely where to be and what to do the very instant that time begins to move backwards captains log supplemental after placing the modified tricorder on the romulan ship we have returned to the enterprise\nacknowledged counsellor are you in position\nall right mister data\ngo ahead mister data\nbe ready to stop the power transfer mister data\nno time to explain number one continue the evacuation of the romulan ship you ll find

however starfleet has dispatched admiral nec hay ev to take command in this sector in preparation for a possible borg invasion\nno wait a minute thats it hugh\ndata ami interrupting something\ni wanted to see if you were ready to return to duty i need some help with an analysis of the ship theborg were using\ndata exactly what is it that are your e doing here\nany luck\nyeah sure\ndata wait a minute that thing could kill you\ndata were talking about an experiment here you cant put your life on the line just to prove some theory\nits crazy theres got to be another way cant you think of something other way to make yourself angry\nyeah and im your friend and im not going to just stand around and let you do this\nacknowledged\nour current theory is that the borg have established several trans warp conduits through subspace a ship when entering the conduit is immediately accelerated to an extremely high warp velocity its like falling into a fast moving river and being swept away by the current\nwe dont know normal subspace limitations dont apply to trans warp variables but id say based on the distance we covered during our trip through the conduit the speed would have to be at least twenty times faster than our maximum warp\ntheborg ship emitted some kind of high energy tachyon pulse just before we saw the subspace distortion it seems as though the conduits are keyed to respond to tachyon transmissions of a specific frequency\ncaptain im picking up a tachyon surge looks like whoever sin the shuttle is trying to trigger the trans warp conduit\nwe ve got a pretty good reading of the tachyon pulse they sent we might be able to duplicate it\nive set up a temporary tachyon matrix in the main deflector i think i can use it to simulate the pulse sent by the shuttle\nenergising the matrix emitting tachyons in the lower bandwidth\nall right switching to the secondary bandwidth nothing maybe if i try alternating the frequencies\ncompensating with auxiliary power\ncaptain\nive scanned three different star systems within sensor range there is evidence of at least two advanced civilisations but im reading no life signs but there are indications that plasma weapons have been fired in those systems recently\nit looks more like a natural phenomenon theres an unusually high amount of em interference in the planets magnetosphere\nwe could but there could be fifty borg down there waiting for us and wed never even know it\nwell data can move pretty fast even over rough terrain but based on what we know about the borg i dont think they should be able to move any faster than you ori they might have been able to get fifteen or twenty kilometres from the shuttle by now\naye sir\nwho ll be in command of the enterprise\nwell no nothing sir\nhome in on that response with our tricorder s yeah i thought about that the only problem is that the pulse would probably have to be so powerful that it would destroy data s positronic net in the process\nim having trouble scanning the interior\ni dont think so there are no borg energy signatures but there is a door or a hatch or something about twenty metres this way\nsome things wrong i cant get any kind of energy signatures from these light sources\nstop\nyou should listen to her captain shes way ahead of you\nright and im not alone\nthere will be fifteen star ships in this sector by the day after tomorrow the gor kon will be my flagship youll take command of task force three consisting of the enterprise the crazyhorse and the agamemnon\ncaptain ive read the report that you submitted to admiral brooks last year regarding the borg you called hugh and ive been trying to figure out why you let him go\nas i understand it you found a single borgata crash site brought it aboard the enterprise studied it analysed it and eventually found a way to send it back to the borg with a programme that would have destroyed the entire collective once and for all but instead you nursed theborg back to health treated it like a guest gave it a name and then sent it home why\nof course you had a choice you could ve taken the opportunity to rid the federation of a mortal enemy one that has killed tens of thousands of innocent people and which may kill even more\nyour priority is to safeguard the lives of federation citizens not to wrestle with your conscience now i want to make it clear that if you have a similar opportunity in the future an opportunity to destroy the borg you are under orders to take advantage of it is that understood\nwhat how dare you\nthe bet is ten cant you do simple arithmetic i dont even know why im here in the first place what is the point of playing this ridiculous game\ncan we get this over with please its your bet\nblast if old\noh ni aka three

moment on i want to maintain a level two security alert post armed officers on every deck\nnumber one i want you to analyse our sensor readings of the borg ship try to determine if it was something

that clear\nwhen hugh was separated from the borg collective he began to grow and to evolve into something other than an automaton he became a person when that happened i felt i had no choice but to respect his rights as an individual\nno one is more aware of the danger than iam but i am also bound by my oath and my conscience to uphold certain principles and i will not sacrifice them in order to\nyes sir\nwhats our eta\ncontact the crazyhorse and the agamemnon have them standing by in case we need them\nmister worf acknowledge the signal from new berlin and transmit another copy of starfleet s ship recognition protocols and tell them to read it this time\ncome\nan artificially created energy conduit that could be anything\ni dont want excuses number one i want answers im sorry he was in this room will i could have rid the federation of a mortal threat and i let him go\nit may turn out that the moral thing to do was not the right thing to do\ndoesnt it seem strange to you that there have been two borg attacks and the enterprise has been the nearest ship in both instances\ntake us out of warp near that ship\non screen\nlay in an intercept course full impulse lock phasers\ntheyre not going to get away with it this time picard to engineering transfer auxiliary and emergency power to the impulse engines\npicard to engineering can we transfer auxiliary power to

force field\nwhat is your designation\ncros is how did you get that name\nwho is that\nbut you are borg your goal is not to destroy but to assimilate us into the collective\ntell me more about this one does he have a name is he called hugh\nwhy must this one destroy biological organisms\ni am locutus of borg you will respond to my questions this is going nowhere doctor i want an autopsy performed on the other one compare the differences with what we learned of hughs anatomy see if there have been any recent modifications which might explain these behavioural differences data run a bio spectral analysis on this borg see if he is trying to send a subspace signal to the others\nhow fast would a ship travel through one of these conduits\nis there any way for us to duplicate\nwho authorised a launch\npicard to shuttlecraft identify yourself and return to the ship immediately mister worf lock on with a tractor beam and return it to the ship\nmister laforge can we follow them into the conduit\nthe question isis data a prisoner or did he go willingly\nperhaps data s recent flash of emotion has something to do with this it could have affected him more profoundly than we realise either way we have to find him\nmister worf red alert\nbring us to the last known coordinates of the shuttlecraft\nmister laforge\ntake us in ensign one half impulse\nreport\ncan you locate the shuttle\nyes mister laforge\ntheborg have been busy\nlay in that course ensign and engage at full impulse\nare they intentionally jamming our sensors\ncan we transport through the interference\nagreed take a well armed away team and transport down to those coordinates have the transporter chief keep a permanent lock on your signals so we can get you out of there at the first sign of trouble\ncan you determine how long they ve been gone from the shuttlecraft\nstandby number one assuming that they re still together how far could they have travelled in three hours\npicard to riker\nim going to start sending down other away teams set up a command post and begin mapping out a search plan\npicard out i want to use the shuttlecraft for low level reconnaissance have the designated pilots assemble at main shuttle bay\nand all available personnel including you and me will begin to put together four man away teams well leave a skeleton crew onboard the ship\nif the borg should attack dont wait for me or anyone else to return to the ship but take the enterprise to the trans warp conduit return to federation space\ngood luck captain\nwhos manning the command post\nanything mister laforge\nwhat if we modified the phasers to send out a luve tric pulse it might create a resonance fluctuation in datas power cells\ncome on\ncan you tell if it was built by the borg\nwell it certainly has nt been abandoned\nits a dampening field this entire structure could be shielded from our sensors lets go\ndata\nwhat\nlore\nred alert all personnel report to duty stations\nweve received a distress call from the oh ni aka three outpost they said they were under attack\nno we havent been able to raise them since the initial contact\nstandby phasers and photon

were going to need to do a room to room search worf you and corel ki start searching the north wing you and i will take the south\ntheres not much damage it doesnt look like they were interested in the station just the people\ndata data are you all right\nwhat happened\nthey were fast aggressive almost vicious it was more like fighting klingons than borg no offence\nthere was another difference i dont believe they were part of the borg collective i think they were acting as individuals\none of them referred to himself as i\nthey seemed more concerned with the death of their colleague and with destroying us i didnt see anything that suggested they wanted to assimilate anybody\naye sir\nred alert all hands to battlestations lay in a course engage warp nine\nwe received a distress call from the new berlin colony theyre under attack\nthird time today stand down red alert reduce speed return to our patrol route\ni thought you might like to see this geordi s analysis of the subspace

him\nlike what\nwhat happened\nim curious why are you ignoring the one emotion youve already experienced why arent you trying to make yourself angry again\ndata feelings arent positive and negative they simply exist its what we do with those feelings that becomes good or bad for example feeling angry about an injustice could lead someone to take a positive action to correct it\nthose are very strong emotions and your e right very little good can come from them but i dont think that an exploration of anger need necessarily lead to hatred or malice\nweve served together for a long time and i think ive come to know you pretty well i have to believe if you ever reach your goal of becoming human you wont become a bad one\nwhen exactly did you feel this other emotion\nif you had to give this

emotions\ncounsellor troi told me herself that feelings are not negative or positive it is how we act on them that makes them good or bad\nyou simply do not understand in a quest such as ours

removed from lores body before he was dismantled\nno i am pleased to say it was damaged when i was forced to fire on lore\nyes but emotions were responsible for what i did to you i would never risk letting that happen again my friendship with you is too important to me\nyes\nyes i have doubts\nyes i will\naye sir\naye sir\naye sir\naye sir\naye sir\naye sir\naye sir\nwe are hugh\nwhy are you here commander riker hasnt the crew of the enterprise caused enough damage already\nyou gave me a sense of individuality changed me then sent me back to the collective you must have known that change would be passed on to others\nthen you made it possible for lore to dominate us\nyou dont know the condition we were in when he found us before my experience on the enterprise theborg were a single minded collective the voices in our heads were smooth and flowing but after i returned those voices began to change they became uneven discordant for the first time individual borg had differing ideas about how to proceed we couldnt function some borg fought each other others simply shut themselves down many starved to death\nyou probably cant imagine what it is like to be so lost and frightened that you will listen to any voice which promises change\nthats what we wanted someone to show us the way out of confusion lore promised clarity and purpose in the beginning he seemed like a saviour the promise of becoming a superior race of becoming fully artificial was compelling we gladly did everything he asked of us but after a while it became clear that lore had no idea how to keep his promise thats when he began talking about the need for us to make sacrifices before we realised it this was the result\nlore began to experiment trying to remake us in his image this is the result of my encounter with the enterprise commander so you can see i dont particularly welcome your presence here\ntell me about my friend\nthe human called geordi\ni can not help you i can not risk our being discovered\nthese caverns lead to tunnels which run beneath the compound some of them connect with the environmental control ducts\nwhen they realise your escape route may be compromised\ngood luck commander\nno\nperhaps my encounter with the enterprise affected me more than i realised\ni dont know we cant go back to the borg collective and we no longer have a leader here\nperhaps in time we will learn to function as individuals and work together as a group\ngoodbye captains log stardate 470254 we have returned to federation space and are en route to starbase two nine five mister laforge remains under doctor crushers care\ntheborg have established several trans warp conduits through subspace\ndata just because you havent experienced certain emotions doesnt mean they dont exist lore is only feeding you the negative ones\nwhy\nlore must have told data to take my visor because he realised i could see a carrier wave that was radiating from him\ni think whats happening is that lore is tapping into the chip he stole from doctor soong and somehow hes found a way to transmit part of that emotional programme to data\nyeah im sure that s intentional but in order for data to be affected by those emotions lore would have had to disable his ethical programme first\nif i can generate a phased ke dion pulse at the right frequency that would trigger data s subsystems and reboot the programme\nright\nso got any ideas on how we generate a ke dion pulse\ndata whos there\ncaptain\ncome on hurry data was just here i think he went to get something\ni think it needs a little work\nwhats happening\nwhat are you going to do to me\ndata listen lore is controlling you hes transmitting a carrier wave which is affecting your positronic matrix\ndont you care that he s manipulating you\ni dont care much for those odds\nno im just a little dizzy\nyeah yeah its possible see if you can locate the phase modulation circuitry\nokay good now do you see anything that we might be able to use as a flux inhibitor tait t\nyou know data ive been thinking about some of the times weve had like that time we went sailing on deval a lake you remember that\nyou decided to go swimming and when you jumped out of the boat you sank straight to the bottom\nyou had to walk over a kilometre along the bottom to get back to shore\nit took almost two weeks to get the water out of your servos\ndata if you ever go back to the way you were you might not be able to forgive yourself for what your e about to do\nhi data i just wanted to let you know that doctor crusher says ill be able to return to duty soon\nwhats that\ndoes it work\npleased data youve wanted emotions all your life\ndata i wouldnt be very much of a friend if i let you give up on a lifelong dream would i maybe

programme my father designed i wouldnt want to give it up its what has given me such a strong sense of family an intense desire to reunite with my dear brother\ni am talking to you picardi will tell you all you need to know\nyou simply dont understand do you you have no idea what has happened here how i found my true calling how the borg found something to believe in\ni told you i will tell you what you need to know\nyou see picard hes not your pawn anymore ive helped him to break free just as ive helped them look at them look at what ive helped them become theyre no longer simply mindless automatons theyre passionate alive\nno you did that you and your friends all i did was clean up the mess you made when that borg you befriended returned to his ship\nthat doesnt matter\nwhats important is what ive done here how i found my calling i know now why i was created no one can ever take that away from me without me they would have perished when i stumbled on their ship they were lost disoriented they had no idea how to function as individuals they couldnt even navigate their own vessel they had lost their sense of purpose i gave them their purpose and they gave me mine\nthe reign of biological life forms is coming to an end you picard and those like you are obsolete take them brother acting captains log supplemental the skeleton crew left onboard the enterprise is unable to help in the search for commander data the planets unusual em field is interfering with the ships sensors severely limiting their effectiveness\nnow thank you there you are brother\ni thought it might look good on me what do you think maybe we should work on your sense of humour brother actually i was thinking laforge s implants might make him an ideal test subject for my experiment\nusing the humans to perfect the procedure will allow us to prevent any further borg deaths\ngood what is it\nive asked you to stay linked to cros is at all times you know that dont you\ni know this must be difficult for you i know how uncertain you must feel all of these sensations are new and they can be frightening isnt that right\nof course you do its only natural no one is going to blame you for that but in order to lose those doubts to keep you from fear and confusion away i need you to remain linked with the others so that their strength and their confidence can help you i need you go vali need you to help me build a future for the borg i cant do it without you will you help me\nthere you are brother have you made any progress with laforge\ni suspect none of the humans will survive the process but then its their own fault isnt it they should never have come here what were they thinking\nhumans are so sentimental\nwhy are you talking like that is something wrong with your programming may be i should check your systems\ni think ive made a mistake i dont believe you can tolerate the amount of emotion ive given you perhaps i should cut back a little\nhows that\nthen you prefer having more emotions\nthey give you pleasure\nallright a little more for now arent you going to thank me\ndont mention it i just hope this helps to clarify things for you\ni am concerned about my brother cros is i dont believe he really wants to be a part of our great future\nah captain thank you so much for joining us you are going to assist me in a most important ceremony\nits time to put aside all doubts brother its time to close the door on the past and commit yourself to the great work that lies ahead of us i need to know i can count on you as proof i want you to kill picard\ni didnt think you d be able to do it youve spent too many years among humans\nive asked many sacrifices of you sacrifices i knew were necessary in order to build a better future i want you to know that i ask no more of you thani am prepared to give myself i am willing to make the greatest sacrifice of all my own dear brother goodbye data\nyou should be careful with that brother somebody could get hurt\nive got a way out of here im willing to forget about what happened back there and take you with me we dont need anyone else were brothers ill give you the chip our father made it contains much more than just emotions it has memories memories our father wanted you to have\nwithout me you will never feel emotion again\ni love you brother\nhe was here in this room i could have rid the federation of a mortal threat and i let him go\nif the borg should attack dont wait for me or anyone else to return to the ship but take the enterprise to the trans warp conduit return to federation space\nlore\nim not particularly impressed all youve done is teach them to enjoy killing\nhe gave you the chip the one doctor soong made for you\nhow did he do it data what made you decide to come here\nyour e controlling him and youve corrupted theborg\ni would like to learn about that but i want data to tell us\nhow about that data he wont even let you talk\ndata do you remember when hugh was on the enterprise do you remember what you were like then\nit does tomei want to know what has happened to data\ndata you must realise that something has happened to you the data i know would never have agreed to be a willing party to lores plan\nfine but what about the things that lore is proposing what about the lives that have already been lost\na carrier wave is that how he s manipulating data\ncan were activate it\nand although lore would still be feeding him negative emotions at least data might listen to us\ndata where are you taking him\ndata wait let us talk to you\nsee if the corridor is empty\nwhat have you done to him\ni was able to take part of a transceiver from the guards interlink system i think that it uses some kind of phased pulse technology do you think it could be modified to generate a ke dion pulse that would reboot data s programme\nall right i think ive found it\nwell ive done everything that geordi said now to activate it\nwell only tell that when we see his behaviour\nno its one programme among thousands i just hope this force field has enough energy to trigger the pulse\nyour e killing him he wont survive another session\ndata its not too late if you remove the fibres then geordi might yet recover\nwhy because lore tells you so\ngood data isnt good and bad right and wrong a function of your ethical programme\nwhat does that programme tell you about what you redoing to geordi about what you and lore are doing to the borg it tells you that these things are wrong doesnt it data so how can actions that are wrong lead to a greater good\nno your e not confused data your e sensing the truth your ethical programme is fighting the negative emotions that lore is sending you\nwhat about geordi and troi\nwelcome back data\nwhat will you do now\nim not sure that s true\ngood luck hugh\nlieutenant powell here sir\naye sir\ni dont believe they were part of the borg collective one of them referred to himself as i\nriker to enterprise\ni cant contact the captain it could just be interference but id like to be sure\narmstrong you and the others prepare to beam up\nbeverly worf and i will stay here and look for\nthe captains team\nyou pull as many people off the surface as you can and get back to the trans warp conduit the captains orders were to get the enterprise back to federation space\nriker out\nriker to any team leader\nroundup everybody who was left behind take cover try to avoid any contact with the borg\nriker out even if beverly can get back to federation space it ll be a few days before starfleet can get any ships here until then were on our own\nwith all this interference it could be a hundred metres away and we wouldnt know it this could take hours\nresidual thermal traces somebody stood here\nthey took this path\nhugh\nwe considered it we knew it was a possibility\nand then lore came along\nwhat happened to them\nim sorry you feel that way we just came to get our people we wont cause you anymore trouble\nfriend\ni wish i could tell you about him we think he may be held inside the compound\ncan you at least show us away into the compound\nwell have to move fast if we need to stun one of the guards theborg will know right away that he s been hurt\ni guess well have to take that chance\nthe enterprise is in orbit i had them beamed aboard\nwhat made you change your mind hugh\nsalazar here sir\naye sir\nseventy three sir\nforty seven sir\none minute should do it\nif i can get a good lock on them quickly i might be able to do it in forty five or fifty seconds\nwere pulling the last

the sensor noise ill bring the modifications online\nim not getting a comm signal from anyone on the captains team\nsir im picking up a vessel closing in on our location\nit seems to match the

reached the coordinates of the conduit the tachyon matrix is energised and ready to go and lieutenant barnaby has returned from the surface hell be relieving me\nyes sir\naye sir\nlaunching buoy now sir\nwe have to assume the ship that attacked us is still in orbit\nif their sensors function as well as ours it could be as little as thirty seconds\nif your calculations are even slightly off wed hit the atmosphere\nim starting to get sensor resolution theres the ship\nonce were in orbit we should have about forty five seconds before they intercept us\nwere in standard orbit sir theborg ship is on the planets far side and is moving to intercept\ntheyre preparing to fire\nshields down to eighty percent\nshields down to seventy three percent\nsir that heading takes us directly into the sun\nsir hull temperature is rising now at twelve thousand degrees c radiation level nearing ten thousand rads\nshields at sixty two percent\nhull temperature is critical we cant withstand this heat much longer\nhull temperature dropping down to seven thousand degrees\nsir theborg ship is taking up position relative to ours theyre going to wait for us to come out\nsir i think i have an idea i think its possible we could induce a solar fusion eruption that would destroy the borg ship\nwe need to direct a highly energetic particle beam onto the suns surface that should produce a superfluid gas eruption if we target the right spot the eruption would envelop theborg ship\ni did my senior honours thesis on solar dynamics\nive already configured the tractor emitters to create the particle be a man dive located the target point on the surface\nwell ill just have to make sure my calculations are accurate lieutenant\nyes sir\nthe target area of the photosphere is destabilising pressure wave expansion is accelerating\nthe only borg who had a name was hugh\ndata i can sense feelings in you\nare you saying that you caused them to become individuals\ndata all im sensing from you is

it free may be i accidentally damaged it you can fix it cant you\nim sorry im sorry im sorry\ni cant believe i did that that i damaged our only chance ive waited for so long at first i had hoped that id be rescued i kept setting up micro fusion flares and looking up at the sky and waiting for someone to come and take me away but it never happened theresa precipice near here i used to go there and stare down at the gorge and id think i can just step over the edge and end it all and then i realised it was the hope that was driving me crazy that i had to accept that i would never get out of

much to look at but they taste good what are you doing your e going to hurt yourself\nwell id say this is cause for celebration i may still have so meter elli an spices around here and ill boil these

heard that in moments of diplomatic tension it is often helpful to find elements of commonality\nyou share all of those qualities in abundance perhaps you should try to build on your similarities\nwhy do you ask\nit is our pleasure to be here captain\nallow me to introduce v oval he will be taking you back to our home world\nplease\nare you going to eat\nyou have no food on your plate are you going to eat\ndesserts what is this\nmy people eat only for nourishment\nthat is that is\ndelicious\nare you sure you dont want some of this this papal la juice\nare you sure it is very delicious\nplease

chocolate\nfascinating species\nwhats keeping them\nah your e justin time theyre about to disembark\nambassador lo que l ambassador by let him captain picard welcome onboard the enterprise\nit is an honour to be the site of the first cultural exchange between the iya aran people and the federation\nhow do you do im looking forward very much to meeting with the premier of iyar there will be a reception held in your honour when you will meet the rest of my senior staff i ofcourse shall be on my way to your home world but i shall be leaving you in the safe hands of my most experienced officers lieutenant worf of the klingon empire is my head of security he will be in charge of your safety while your e on board counsellor deanna troi of the planet beta zed will be your personal liaison office ambassador lo que l\nambassador by leth this is commander william riker my first office from the planet earth he has been assigned to you\nwell commander riker is a skilled diplomat with wide experience in interspecies contact\nwell that will be just fine mister worf\ngood luck\nso i understand that your home world has some of the most spectacular crystal formations in this sector is there any place in particular that you would recommend i visit while im there\nwell ier whats our eta\ni think ill go update my itinerary\nwhat happened\nwhats the cause\nthere is an m class planet in this system can we reach it\ninertial dampeners are offline life support is failing\nvelocity dropping thermal shields at full power\nv oval v oval try not to move you may have a concussion picard to enterprise picard to enterprise do you readme too much interference\nthere is a structure of some kind some energy readings about two kilometres south of her ev oval im going to try to find help do you understand now try to stay conscious and dont leave the shuttle theres some kind of plasma energy out on the surface ill be back as soon as i can\nis someone there whos there\nwhat do you want who are you who are you\nnowait stop there was someone else in the shuttlecraft with me the pilot hes injured he needs your help\nhello smells good thank you this is a ter elli an cargo freighter isnt it is this your ship are you one of the crew\nhow many people survived were you the only one well youre certainly not ater elli an unless you ve lost two of your arms whats your name im jean luc picard ima starfleet officer\nanna are there other people on this planet how long have you been here\nwhat was the date when you crashed\nseven years\nanna anna wait a minute\nanna anna listen to me listen on the shuttle there is a lot of equipment that will have survived the crash we can use it to contact starfleet theyll send a ship for us we can leave\nyes both of us now if you will help me to get to the shuttle ow\ndont worry i wont move\nlet them knit\nperhaps you could go to the shuttle bring the equipment back here\ngood go into the cockpit and look for a small comm panel in the instrument array see if you can remove it bring it back here\nanna why was this door locked from the outside\nfrom what\ngood\nif we can boost the output field i might be able to send a distress signal something seems to be wrong with it\nthis transmitter module has been totally destroyed how could that happen it looks as though its been hit by a phaser blast\nno\nanna we will get out of here its not going to be easy but we need to work together\nanna no matter how long it takes we will get out of here\nno no no its all right im just trying to dislodge this power cell nearly got it there no no its allright the energy relays are corroded but i think it should be able to hold one more charge if i can regenerate this then i may be able to reactivate the shuttle crafts engines\nthat sounds delightful\nof course anna would you pass me that tricorder im going to try to repair these energy relays\nann aim grateful to you for saving my life and i think that you are a warm and compassionate person and i feel a great sympathy for what you ve been through alone here on this planet but i dont think that you can really be in love with me\nno im the first person youve seen in seven years im bringing you the hope of leaving this place dont you think that you could possibly be just a little confused right now\ni think thats a little premature we hardly know anything about each other\nno harm done its going to take at least a couple of hours to charge this cell then as soon as its done we should get it over to the shuttle immediately this cell casing is already beginning to break down anna we are going to get out of here\nthe power cell is ready we should take it over to the shuttle\nwhy not\nwe dont have a few hours i told you this cell is already beginning to degenerate\nim feeling very much better in fact i dont intend to go on using this any longer\ntheres no pain it would appear i dont have any broken ribs after all\nwhats going on why are you trying to keep me here\nwhy are you keeping me locked in this freighter you say that there are wild animals out there but i havent heard or seen a single one of them\nwhat about that comm panel you said you damaged it when you were cutting it out of the shuttle did you you see i find it hard to believe that you would destroy the one piece of equipment that could get you out of hereafter seven years and what was this really for to keep me immobilised\nso it was necessary to keep me captive\nim going to go look for the shuttle myself\nanna\nanna no\nanna stop\nanna anna anna where are you going\nyes inside here\ninside the freighter the door is on the opposite side over here the doors over here\nv oval i thought you were dead\nyes theres a woman living here she told me that shed been to the shuttle she said that she saw you dead\ni see\nyes\nshe was upset\nits possible\nyou stay here keep warm ill go and look for her\nanna anna\nwe can search it twice as fast if we separate\nanna anna\nanna anna\nyou dont have to do this i found v oval the shuttle pilot hes still alive he can help us get away from here\nnono i wont promise you have been manipulating me havent you\nthe necklace it broke i saw it in the cargo freighter on the floor by the fire i left it there now its around your neck its whole how\nwhere sv oval isnt it convenient that he arrived moments after you left that he insisted that i come here to look for you that i find you here on the ledge ready to jump thats very good timing dont you think\nare you and v oval working together hes the only one who could have brought you the necklace\ngo ahead why dont you do it its a long way down must be two hundred metres you ddie instantly if thats what you want but i dont think that it really is\nfailed v oval what is going on\nambassador\nbut why did you believe that bringing me here would give you a better understanding of love\nand the man was injured and she nursed him back to health and they fell in love\nlet me just say that we would not take such a direct approach ambassador i have tell you that in my culture what you have done would be considered a crime\nwell well can talk about it later for now i think we should get off this planet ami in assuming the damage the shuttle is not as bad as it seems\ni think that now would be quite nice\nfor me as well ambassador\nnoon the contrary i found your approach intriguing we humans tend to take a rather balanced approach towards life never too much never too little and its very nice to find a culture that is willing to take an experience to its

have spend about five minutes greeting the iya a rans may be an hour making smalltalk at this reception im the one who has to escort them around the ship for the next three days\nits all part of being in starfleet there\nprotocol\nthat is an incredibly outmoded and sexist attitude im surprised at you besides you look good in a dress\ndo you think there s enough food here data good

game of poker\nthe bet is ten thats to you ambassador\nwait a minute calm down\nstop mister worf that is an order\nyou look a little sore\neleven hours\nambassador its an honour to meet you would you like to see your quarters before we attend the reception\nso first thing tomorrow i thought id take you on a tour of the operational centres and the residential decks of the ship then we could spend some time discussing the cultural underpinnings of your society\nexcuse me\noh well actually i was waiting until we got to the desserts\nits something we eat after the main course its usually very sweet its usually very bad for you we eat it purely for pleasure if you ask me its the best part of any meal\noh well let me introduce you to some of my favourites this is peach cobbler with whipped cream t arvo kian powder cake and this is my favourite k tarian chocolate puff i dont know exactly what s inside but i think its made with seventeen varieties of chocolate\ndelicious\nambassador i think were going to get along very well shall we\nthis deck is devoted mainly to stellar cartography biological research and astrophysics we have over a thousand people on board\nno thank you im still recovering from all those desserts last night\nim sure\nyum next were going to go to deck eight which is interesting because its not really finished its sort of a multipurpose deck sometimes when we need an extra labor ambassador\nits a child\nchildren are our offspring theyre our young they grow into adults over a period of many years they grow into beings like us\nambassador im curious now does your species procreate\ni see\nthat sounds like a wonderful idea come on eric\nambassador lo que ls quite pleasant i will admit though he sa little unusual\nhe seems preoccupied with recreation ive spent more time in ten forward in the last two days than i have in the past two months and hes obsessed with food especially chocolate\nto be honest hes testing even my limits\nworf you ve been very patient with ambassador by let hand thats good but maybe its time to let him know that some behaviour is unacceptable to us i think its all right to suggest limits for the ambassador\nim in for twenty\nafter the past few days i could use something a little bland goodbye ambassador\nhello is anyone in there\nhello\nno\nseventeen hours thirty two minutes\ntheres been a systemwide power failure\nwe have entered an energy disruption field i do not recognise the configuration attitude controls failing\ni will try\nentering the planets atmosphere\nprepare for impact\ndead\nyes that is understandable when my species is injured our metabolic rate slows until our body can heal itself this state could easily be mistaken for death\nwhen you did not return to the shuttle i intended to track you surface conditions made it very difficult so cold is awsome one running away from here was it the woman\nwhy did she leave the shelter\ndo you think she may harm herself theres a dangerous precipice near here she was headed in that direction\nthen we should go find her\nwe will go together\ncaptain this ridge extends for a kilometre in either direction\ni have failed\nmy name is ambassador v oval\nmy mission was to study human intimacy specifically the concept you call love in our study of your culture we did not understand certain concepts so we sent three representatives to study them to experience them\nseveral years ago we discovered the remains of the ter elli an freighter on this planet the ship contained logs made by a single survivor a human woman that was our first contact with human culture the woman lived alone here for seven years until another human crashed on this planet a human male\nin the logs she described many concepts we found difficult to understand pleasure antagonism love these were alien to us we wished to experience them for ourselves ambassador lo que l was sent to experience pleasure by leth was sent to experience antagonism and i was sent to experience love was this wrong\ncrime\nthat is correct we can leave at anytime\nthank you captain this has been an enlightening experience\ni am sorry if our diplomatic methods offended you\ngoodbye captain\ngood evening\nenter enter\ni am having problems\nklingons do not procrastinate it is a tactical delay\ni do not enjoy these diplomatic situations\ni do not see why it is necessary to wear these ridiculous uniforms\nthey look like dresses\nyes yes ambassador it would be my pleasure to\nthis way\ni am sorry you do not care for our\ndoctor it is all right i am happy to bring more food\nfine\nambassador by let his demanding temperamental and rude\nthe engineering sections encompass twelve decks of the secondary hull deck forty two contains the antimatter storage facility\nexcuse me\ni am not certain of the exact rate\nthis way\ni am going to kill him with my bare hands i will take him by the throat and i will rip out his oesophagus\ni have failed in my mission commander i am clearly a bad diplomat for the sake of the ship and the federation i request reassignment\ncommander the seiya a rans are arrogant irritating they can not be reasoned with\nyou see you see they are insane\nbah\ni min and i raise twenty\nexcuse me ambassador those are my chips\ni saw you take two chips from my pile\nyes\ni am losing because you ve been cheating all along\nyou

    "episode 153": "all his vital functions are completely normal\npsychosomatic response\nthe interface is perfect for geordi because his visor inputs allow the probe to transmit information directly into his cerebral cortex\nthe probe is designed to respond to any movement geordi intends to make when his brain sends a message to move his leg the interface should move the probe instead\ngeordi whats wrong\nvital signs normal geordi how do you feel\nyour pulse has gone up your nervous system probably has to get used to the input levels\nill be the judge of that if your heart rate gets too high were going to disconnect you\ngo to eighty percent of tolerance data no higher\ndata disconnect what happened geordi\ntheyre burned\nthere was some kind of energy discharge in the interface suit\nyes but i have a theory why they didnt the tolerance levels of the interface were set extremely high i think geordi s neural response to the input was so strong that it created a feedback loop\nif we operate the interface at lower input levels id say the risk is acceptable\nwell it looks like you ll have time to recuperate\nwere receiving the probes telemetry\ni want to start with as wide a margin of safety as possible we can adjust upward later ready\ngeordi who are you speaking to what are you seeing\ngeordi report\nwere disconnecting you right now\nhe sin neural shock\nthe sensory overload didnt cause any permanent damage but i wouldnt want to expose his brain to that kind of stimulus again\nhis brain functions are normal\nim not sure i do know that our brains werent designed to process the kind of sensory information geordi was getting when the brain receives something it cant understand it interprets the input as best it can sometimes as a smell or a sound sometimes visually\nbut geordi im not saying that your mother was really communicating with you im just trying to give you a reason why you might ve thought that she was\ni do not recommend that he use the interface again the sensory overload almost killed you\nhis neural synapses are overloading he cant survive this\nif we take him off too abruptly hell go into neural shock\nwe could disconnect the interface and still maintain the input levels\nalmost\nswitching inputs\nhis vital signs are stabilising hes going to make it captains log supplemental we have succeeded in disengaging mister laforge from the interface and are en route to starbase four nine five\nthe interface unit is operating within expected parameters\nno one else has reported so complete a sensory experience\napparently the tactile sensors are too low i will increase the input\nit provides tactile sensations so that geordi can feel hes in the same environment as the probe\ni have reviewed the vessels mission plans the raman was to descend to the lower atmosphere eleven thousand kilometres below its current position the crew was to sample the atmosphere at that level and then return to a safer orbit\nthe probe sends information via a focused particle beam it should be able to cut through the interference\nyes sir\naye siri will be on the bridge\nwe are ready to bring the interface online sir\nactivating the remote sensors initiating interface now\ndo you have visual contact\nacknowledged\nincreasing signal strength to seventy five percent of tolerance\nwhat is your position\na magnetic storage bay\ncome in laforge\nnoi have completed the adjustments on the interface i am now waiting for commander riker to finish moving the probe do you need to be comforted\ni am using the time to catch up on my study of poetry\nthat is not entirely correct while it is true the display is currently blank this emptiness has a poetic meaning therefore it can not be considered nothing as such\nthe ancient do osod arians much of their poetry contained such lacunae or empty space soften these pauses measured several days in length during which poet and audience were encouraged to fully acknowledge the emptiness of the experience\nare you certain you do not wish to talk about your mother\nyou are no doubt feeling emotional distress as a result of her disappearance while you claim to be just passing by that is most likely an excuse to start a conversation about this uncomfortable subject ami correct\nthen i apologise for my premature assumption this particular poem has a lacuna of forty seven minutes you may experience the emptiness with me if you wish\ni do not understand\nmy initial assumption was correct you do wish to speak of your mother\nyour sanity is not in question however your evaluation of the available information is biased\ndisappearances fitting the profile of the hera have rarely ended with the safe recovery of ship and crew\ni am not offended you are upset your reactions are not surprising\nthe input levels are currently at fifty three percent of tolerance\ninitiating interface\ni am increasing the input now\nis this level sufficient geordi geordi do you hear me\nthe cut off has been automatically activated\ngeordi i have analysed the probes sensor logs there are no record to indicate the presence of a living human onboard the raman\nwe have no indication of a transmission of any kind\nthe probe does allow geordi to sense quantum fluctuations subspace anomalies and other phenomenon not perceptible by any other kind of sensors\nif the hera is on the surface its hull could not possibly withstand the pressure of the atmosphere\ni have been exploring the possibility of using a tractor beam to pull the raman from the atmosphere however the high level of interference prevents a positive lock\nthat is my conclusion as well commander two shuttlecraft staggered between the enterprise and the raman with their shields adjusted to refocus the tractor beam\nthere have been reports of warp bubbles and other subspace deformations\nyes sir however it is highly unlikely\nnearly impossible sir\ni suspected you would attempt to operate the interface alone\ni am familiar enough with your behaviour patterns to predict certain decisions\nyou are disobeying the captain\ni can not allow you to endanger your wellbeing\ni could have you confined to quarters for the duration of the mission\ni will monitor the interface and attempt to keep you safe i can not have you confined to quarters for something you have not yet done\nthere is a high degree of probability that you are correct\nhowever i do have a request\ni would ask you to consider the possibility that what you see is not real\ni am establishing the interface\ngeordi are you seeing the image of your mother\ni am reading unusual subspace energy in your vicinity similar to what the probe sensor recorded the first time you encountered your mother\ngeordi the atmosphere becomes increasingly turbulent the farther down you go you may not be able to bring the raman close enough to the hera before being destroyed\nthe probe is descending out of range\nwe are already at seventy five percent of tolerance\nthat is theoretically true but even at this level of input you are already experiencing dangerous neural feedback\ni will increase the gain incrementally as you descend\nwhen we are ready to disconnect the interface we must allow enough time to lower the input levels otherwise your nervous system will go into shock from the sudden drop in input\nunderstood\nwe are at ninety percent of tolerance my calculations show you will reach one hundred percent of tolerance before you are in range of the hera\nthat would not be advisable you must cease your descent\ngeordi you are putting me in a difficult position please cease your descent\ndisengaging safety systems going to full tolerance levels now\nreversing tractor beam\nperhaps we could deceive his neural receptors\nby feeding them the sensory information recorded from his earlier experiences with the probe\nwe could then lower them in a controlled manner\nas well as expected under the circumstances are you okay\ni spoke with your sister this morning she said shell be in touch with you in a few days right now shes pretty upset the service for the hera will probably be on vulcan most of the crew was from there but your sister and i want to have a private ceremony\nand no ship\nstarfleet is considering the hera lost the search isnt much more than a formality at this point geordi your mothers gone\nall right geordi call me if you need anything\njean luc\nwere hosting this years palio the ferengi have already been accused of trying to bribe the breen pilot into throwing the race\nnothing at all i wish i could say i was just calling to catch up on things nine days ago the hera left here on a routine courier mission we were in contact with them for five of those days then the ship disappeared without a trace\nim afraid so the excelsior and the noble have been retracing its course for the last seventy two hours nothing im going to keep them at it for another seventy two but to be honest i dont think another week would make any difference\nnot yet im starting to get some fumes ammonia chlorine potassium chloride\ni can feel the heat from here\nthere it is\nabout ten metres up the line boy it shot id say over two thousand degrees im going in\nwere okay ive activated the emergency suppression system\ni feel like im actually here i mean there in the jefferies tube its funny when i saw the smoke i couldnt help but cough\nwill do wait a minute\nsome things wrong cant get my left leg to work\nthere it goes im on my way down\nnothing im seeing my reflection in a panel\ni forgot what a handsome guy i am captains log stardate 472155 we are responding to a distress call from the science vessel raman which is apparently trapped inside the turbulent atmosphere of an unusual gas giant planet we will use an experimental interface probe in our attempt to rescue it\nsomething must have happened down there may be the shields failed or they had some kind of inversion reaction in the nacelles\nour biosensors are useless theres too much interference in the atmosphere\nbut we may have to operate the probe at close to tolerance levels\nweve already tested the interface at about seventy percent tolerance\nill interface with the probe as soon as its ready take it the rest of the way from there\nmissing my mother\nyour only son ma\ncome in\ndont worry about it\nmy mothers always trying to find me a wife\nthis came in about three weeks ago i never got back to her\nthe interface is calibrated specifically to my visors inputs it would take you at least ten hours to convert it and those crewmen down there cant wait\nforget it im the best person for the job and theres no reason why we shouldnt proceed as planned\nthe hera is missing thats all now until i hear something different my mother might just as well have taken the crew on an unscheduled holiday lets go\nfine\nnot yet\ndata turn up the input sensors im not seeing anything\nokay i can see\nbut no colours\nah thats better\nim excited thats all doctor this is like being on a roller coaster or a first date im all right\nunderstood\nits a mess in here there must be a breach in the hull someplace im picking up atmospheric gasses in the corridor methane and ammonia primarily that break in the hull might even be on the bridge itself im heading towards the bridge ive found someone\nabout twelve metres up the main corridor he strapped under some conduit from the bulkhead i cant move it im going to need more power to the tractor beam\nhes dead data that door at the end of this corridor whatsit lead to\nif there was a break in the bridge that dbe the safest place to go data give me a phaser burst narrow focus level four intensity\nive found them theyre dead all of them theresa fire in here argh\ni dont know my hands\nthe sensors that were transmitting the sensation of heat to my hands must ve overloaded\nif we turn down the sensory input on the probe i should be fine seven people lost their lives down there captain we should at least retrieve the information they were collecting\nyeah theres something ive got to do anyway\nhow are you daddr la\nyeah dr la\ndad dont you think everybodys jumping the gun here last i heard there were still two starships out there looking for them theyve found no debris no residual warp distortion dr la\nnot yet but that doesnt mean they wont dr la\nyeah well you can think that if you want but until i see some hard evidence im not going to give up hope dr la\nnoi was just passing by i was wondering what you were up to\ndata theres nothing on the screen\nsays who\ni remember a few lectures from starfleet academy that seemed like that\nwhy would you ask that\nno data sometimes just passing by means just passing by\nthanks you know data maybe you gave up a little too easily\nwell when i said just passing by means just passing by i really didnt mean it\nami crazy to think that she s still alive\nshe sa starship captain shes gotten herself into and out of impossible situations before why should this be any different\nwell that makes me feel much better look im sorry data i didnt mean to snap at you\nits just that if she really is dead i dont know what im going to do\nthats too low data i wont be able to do anything down there\ngo ahead\ni cant see anything\nyeah yeah thats better but i need more\nmom mom is it you\noh i forgot all you can see is this probe yes its me im actually on the enterprise im interfaced with this probe\nbut is it really you\nbut bow can that be i mean how is it possible\ndown where\nhang on doctor why why do we have to go down to the surface\nwe the hera you mean the hera is down there\nnowait\nmom\ni told you i wasnt hallucinating\nwell she was nt actually there her ship is down on the surface\nsomehow she has managed to communicate with me\nmay be im the only one who can detect it because im interfaced with the probe\nyou see\nlook im telling you my mothers ship is trapped down there and we ve got to help them\nwell at least let me go back down there just to be sure\nill be all right\naye sir\nif you think im going to start talking about my childhood counsellor your e way off\nwell shes shes brilliant funny shes incredibly perceptive she knows people knows what they re all about even before they open their mouths shes always been that way she sa real good judge of character\nabout seven months ago when she first took command of the hera i went to a party she had for her crew she wanted me to come over and see her but i was really busy at the time i mean i suppose i could have made the time to go and see her but you know i just didnt think that i mean you know ii didnt think that\nthats not what i was going to say\nall right\nbut she told me she strapped on that planet that shes in danger now if this was some kind of wish fulfillment dont you think id be fantasising her safe and sound\nyeah well thats your theory counsellor ive got one of my own\nsure yeah as long as we keep them both above the troposphere that ll be all right\nbut what about the hera wed be leaving my mother and her crew stranded on the planet\nive been thinking about this a couple of weeks ago i got a message from my mother she said she had a new chief engineer who had been experimenting with the warp drive now ive seen the hera it uses tr ionic initiators in the warp coil they have a reputation of strange side effects especially when you start playing around with them\nso what if thats what happened not a warp bubble but a subspace funnel\nwell the hera could have accidentally created a distortion that emptied out right here at marijn e seven\nthe hera passed near this planet just ten days ago theres an awful lot of subspace disturbance in the atmosphere the ship couldve accidentally picked up some residual traces that directed the funnel right back here\nmaybe its being surrounded by some kind of warp field but who knows for how long\ni did pick up some pretty strange subspace readings when i was interfaced with the probe\nyeah but i talked to her commander she asked me to bring the raman closer to the planet\ncaptain\ncaptain if im right and theres just one chance in a million that she s alive\ni understand sir\nyou didnt come all the way down here to tell me that\ni guess i feel like i should be the one to decide whether its unnecessary or not\nyour mother was dead there was proof there was a body and a funeral it was a reality\nif i could see a body if there were wreckage i could accept it but my mother has just disappeared and now theres a possibility that she is alive and im not going to quit not yet\ndid you\nwell i guess you know me pretty well\ni cant just sit back and do nothing when i know that my mother might be down on that planet\ndata if i leave without knowing for sure then ill have to live with that for the rest of my life wondering if i left her to die i couldnt do that thats why ive got to do this\nif thats what you need to do data then do it because nothing short of that is going to stop me from trying to save my mother\nwhat are you doing\nyou know we could both get in a lot of trouble for this\nthanks data\nyeah whats that\niwill i promise\nmom mom\nmom how did you get here\nthats just what i thought how are we communicating\nyes and shes just\nconfirmed everything ive been saying\nthat shows hes communicating with me its the only kind of signal they could send that could cut through the interference\nive been thinking about this im going to take the raman into a low stationary orbit and initiate an inverse warp cascade\nthe subspace distortion from the cascade should reverse the warp funnel your ship will end up right back where it started\ni have to try data\nshields back online were starting our descent thank god\nthat your e alive that i was right about all of this i cant wait to call dad he and ariana had given up\nwell eventually yeah data everythings fading in and out\nim losing the interface\nyoull have to turn up the input gain to maintain my connection\ndata you can turn it all the way up to a hundred if you increase it slowly enough give my nervous system chance to adjust\nthere are over three hundred people onboard the hera data you andi are the only chance they ve got\nits working\nonce i initiate the warp cascade we can start dropping the gain\nwell be in sensor range of the hera within a few minutes mom im really sorry i didnt by to see you a few weeks ago\nyeah well im sorry it wont happen again\nthen were going to have to go beyond tolerance\ndata im taking this ship down now if you dont boost the gain past tolerance levels ill lose the interface when we go out of range and my system will go into shock\ni wont do it data your e going to have to increase the tolerance\nthank you data\nwere getting close\nyes captain\nsorry captain but i cant do that\nif i come back now my mother and her entire crew will die\nim scanning for your ship im not getting anything\nno not really i should be picking something up by now im not finding anything theres no warp funnel no ship theres nothing there\nreverse tractor beam\nwhat are you\nyour e your e trapped\ncaught on the ship\nare you saying that you killed the raman screw\nwhat do you want\nthen it was an accident captain i have to take the ship into the lower atmosphere\nas i understand it when the raman got close to the planet it accidentally picked up some life forms that live in the lower atmosphere\nsubspace beings of some kind intelligent when the ship went back into a higher orbit the beings were trapped\none of them can communicate with me\nit must have read my thoughts through the probe interface and took the form of my mother to try to talk me into taking the ship closer to the surface\nyes but i dont think it was on purpose they probably tried communicating with them the same way they re communicating with me by directly accessing their thoughts it must ve been fatal to the crew i guess the interface is what protected me\ni have to take them back captain they cant survive so far up in the atmosphere ill turn the ship around and come back as soon as im\nthe atmosphere is getting more turbulent its overloading the systems\nim having difficulty keeping the shields up\nim losing power\ntotal shield failure in eight seconds\nshields are failing\nyes sir i take complete responsibility data was only\nyes sir\nthank you sir you know it was funny when i was down there it was so

data find another way of salvaging the ramani want an alternate plan in two hours\ngeordi id like you to talk to counsellor trois hes expecting you\ncan we get the shuttles close enough without danger mister laforge\nthen in that case\ncommander\nwhy here\nmister laforge do you have any evidence to support this hypothesis\nmister data is any of this possible\nhow unlikely\nlets proceed with the shuttle plan\ndismissed mister laforge\ni want you to know that i am not unsympathetic to what you re going through your mothers disappearance is tragic but i can not risk your safety on the basis of a dubious hypothesis\nim sorry geordi my decision is made\ncommander laforge\nstop your descent prepare to disengage the interface\ndamnit geordi your e going to kill yourself\ndoctor report\ngeordi whats happening to you\ngeordi\nwhats happening report\nis there any way that we can disconnect him\nreduce the input gradually and still get him out before its too late\ndeceive them\nlike a decompression tank lets try it\nexplain\nhow do you know all this\nare these beings picard\ngeordi whats happening\ncan we switch the input\nis it working\nyou disobeyed my direct order you put yourself in grave danger i am not happy\ni will deal with mister data at another time meanwhile i will have to write this incident into your permanent record\ndismissed geordi im very sorry that you didnt find your mother\ngeordi have you found it yet\nhow far\nwhy did he start coughing when he went through the gasses\nit looks like this is going to work geordi id like to get the probe out of the jefferies tube and onto the launch bay before we reach marijn e seven\nwhat is it\nwhy the bodysuit\nthe crew might still be alive theres no way we can tell from up here\nwe shouldnt have any trouble going higher the safety override will kick in at about ninety eight percent tolerance and that ll disengage the interface\nim sorry i didnt know you were\ngeordi the probe has entered the planets atmosphere and im ready to take it onto the ship if you would like to take a couple of days of fill run the interface\nthe interface doesnt have to be fully compatible i could run it right now i wouldnt have the same control that you have but it would still work\nthe hera is reason enough\ncaptain the probe is through the airlock and in position aboard the raman\nriker here\nwell have to take it into the raman s auxiliary control room their bridge is too badly damaged\na couple of hours we have to cut through the bulkhead\nif we set up some sort of relay system\nconnecting two points through subspace\nso the heras in one piece somewhere out there\ngeordi that could have been anything\nwell be in position to use the tractor beam in less than an hour\nno i didnt geordi i may have seemed a little harsh about the situation aboard the ramani just dont like the idea of one of my best officers putting himself in unnecessary danger\nmy mother died when i was a baby all i have is pictures and the stories that my father used to tell me about her i begged him to tell those stories over and over when i was five and i went to school i started to tell my new friends those same stories pretending that she was alive then i started believing that she was alive that shed just gone away that she was coming back the teacher got wind of this and she and my father had this talk with me they told me it was important to accept the fact that my mother was dead and that she was nt coming back and all the hoping in the world wouldnt make it so in my mind that was the day that my mother actually died i cried all that night but after that it started feeling better\ngeordi\ngeordi\ni saw your father last week and your sister about ten days before that i decided i missed my favourites on\nyour e going to have to see the hera again we ve got a lot of new faces on board including a chief engineer who juices up the nacelles every chance she gets i think shes the best technician in the fleet okay second best\nmaybe you should meet her were going to be in the same sector next week take a shuttle over and ill introduce you\nbut if youre too busy ill see you at your fathers birthday party remember if you talk to him its a surprise\nis it you\nyes geordi its mom\ntheres no time to explain we have to go down\nthe surface\nwere dying\nwe need your help i need your help geordi\nhello geordi\nim not really with you geordi im on my ship on the surface we were pulled into a warp funnel\nwe found a way to send a subspace signal that could cut through the atmospheric interference\nwe need your help\nwhy\nwere running out of time\nthank god\nwere going home\nyou were too busy with work\nno geordi dont please\nthank god\nwere still too far away\nyour e killing us we must go down\ngeordi were safe now goodbye\nwhats your mother like geordi\nthats not what i asked\nwhen was the last time you saw her\nyou didnt think it would be your last chance to see her\ni want to suggest something call it a theory all right\nyour e worried about the disappearance of your mother guilty that you didnt see her when you had the chance so you re unwilling to consider that she might be dead your need to believe she s alive is so strong that it manifests itself as a physical image\nno because that would be the end of your fantasy you d know it wasnt true the more involved and complicated and unending your story is the longer you can believe your mothers still alive\ncaptain i am receiving a transmission from starfleet command admiral holt\ncaptain the raman is

commander im officially placing the enterprise on detached duty your mission is at your discretion good luck\nnegative sir theres too much interference\nscan complete t erik on particle decay profile

cellular debris\ntheres something strange here the cell structures are badly distorted its as if they ve been exposed to some kind of high energy field\nit could be im picking up some faint traces of microcrystalline damage in the floor material but im not familiar with the pattern im getting\ndata here\naye sir\nbarra das three is the only class m planet in this system and it is listed as unpopulated however sensors have detected intermittent energy signals emanating from its surface\nthe planet was used as an outpost for the de brune approximately two thousand years ago the federations archaeological survey has catalogued numerous ruins on the surface\naye sir commander as acting first officer i must question your decision to accompany the away team if captain picard were here\ni realise that sir but if he were and he wanted to lead an away team you would tell him that the captains place is\nis there a malfunction\nwhat is the source\nbridge to transporter room two can you get a lock on the away team\ndata to away team please respond\nwhy was it not detected earlier\nraise shields red alert\ndamage report\ntake us to warp nine and pursue lock phasers on target\nincrease the sensor field bandwidth patch in the lateral sensor arrays\nplot a course and take us back to barra das three notify the away team to prepare for transport\nstarfleet intelligence confirms that a ship matching this configuration has been linked to raids on several other planets in this sector for the short time it was within our visual range we were able to take sensor readings of the mercenary vessel it appears to be encased in an energy absorbing material although we can see the ship this energy sheath renders it virtually undetectable to our long range sensors\nwithout a full compositional analysis of the energy sheath the chances of finding the correct re modulation sequence are remote\non the contrary lieutenant that is precisely what we must do since there are no viable alternative s we will return to the surface and attempt to determine what these mercenaries are doing on this planet an investigation might reveal some indication of their purpose please notify me when you have assembled your search teams dismissed\nperhaps these artefacts have a special value to the romulans\nthese structures were built by the de brune that race is an ancient offshoot of the romulans the ruins on the planet where captain picard was killed were also romulan in origin\nthe question remains why are they stealing these artefacts\nthere are several archaeological sites in this sector containing ruins which are romulan in origin these are the locations that were attacked by the mercenary vessel\nthe only sites not been attacked were on calder two ya dalla prime and draken four\nthat would be their next likely target\nbut it is only a small science station it has limited defensive capabilities i do not believe it could withstand an attack from the mercenary ship mister worf send a message to the federation outpost on calder two advise them that if a ship matching the mercenary vessel approaches they should attempt to delay it until our arrival ensign take us out of orbit set course for the calder system warp nine\nensign scan for starfleet com badge signals is commander riker aboard that ship\nopen a channel\nthis is the federation starship enterprise you are ordered to stand down\ndrop your shields and prepare to be boarded\ncommander are you all right\nthat is impossible sir the ship you are on has violated a federation outpost it is my duty to stop it\ncommander if you could explain\nthat is correct counsellor he does know mister worf prepare to drop the shields\ni am aware of that\nmister worf that is an order\ntheres something strange here the cell structures are badly distorted its as if they ve been exposed to some kind of high energy field\nyes sir\naye sir\ncommander weve lost contact with the away team\nno sir the comm system is being jammed\nsomewhere on the surface\ncommander were picking up a vessel leaving orbit\nthey could have been using the planet as a shield sir they are powering up their weapon systems\nminor hit on the port deflector no damage theyre running sir their speed is warp eight points even and holding i think theyre at their maximum\nsir we should be within phaser range in twenty three seconds switching to long range scanners commander the sensor image of that ship is extremely weak its fading the ship doesnt register on the long range sensors im sorry sir weve lost them\nits no good the signals gone it just disappeared\naye sir\ni cant tell sir sensors are unable to penetrate their hull\nthe signals are difficult to localise but they could be emissions from some kind of power converter\nits tough to get accurate sensor readings theres an awful lot of interference in the area\nim not sure its very un localised it could be atmospheric\nwell these ruins around here are pretty ancient but id say that this indentation was made fairly recently could be the site of some battlefield\nsir theres microcrystalline damage all throughout this area the same kind of pattern that doctor crusher picked up in the floor of that barondes sica two\nlaforge to enterprise we are under attack down here\ni repeat we are under attack\ndata we ve been attacked\nwe ve got one casualty and commander riker has been taken captive\ndata i know this is a long shot but i fire modulate the long range sensor array i might be able to make it sensitive enough to detect the ship\nits possible that the microcrystalline damage i found in these indentations was the result of some kind of high energy transporter beam but i still dont understand the res nothing here thats particularly valuable why would anyone want to steal any of these things\nlooks like they did a pretty thorough job\nya dalla and draken are at the far edge of the sector but calder two thats less than a day from here at maximum warp\naccording to this theresa federation outpost at calder two\ni warned you not to push the engines so hard two of the powers hunts are on the verge of collapse well be lucky if we can maintain warp six\ni can try to realign the warp core itll take at least eleven hours but ill have to shut the engines down completely\nvek or is right we should get rid of him its dangerous to have someone from starfleet on board\nim bypassing the aft plasma couplings the power loss should only last for a few seconds\nit has nothing to do with my repairs i think theresa malfunction in the engines intermix chamber\nit could be one of any thirty subsystem sitll take time to locate\nwe have to jettison the core\nflow regulator is not responding to manual override containment fields wont hold much longer\nwhat are you saying i dont take orders from you\ntheyre right baran and you know it i say kill him now\nif he has nothing to give us we should kill him now and be done with it everyone seems to recognise that fact except you\nhe may not be as useful as you think if this is the same riker that ive heard about\ncommander of the enterprise formerly assigned to the hood\nthen you must be the william trike r with a history of insubordination he was even once relieved of duty during the cardassian incident at minos kor va\nlook ive been smuggling artefacts from federation sites for years you cant help developing a familiarity with certain starfleet personnel if we had nt have captured him he d probably have ended up before a court martial\nlook hes no use to us finish him now let me do it for you\nthe antimatter flow regulator is locked open\nthe flow regulator is frozen\nwe dont have much time its good to see you will i didnt expect to meet you here\nthese mercenaries use weapons that can activate their transporter it gives them the opportunity to be am things quickly just by firing at them thats what they did to me\nthe site that i wanted to study had been raided a lot of the artefacts had been stolen the site had been practically destroyed i wanted to find out who was responsible i tracked them to that barondes sica two i must have asked too many questions they captured me they wanted to find out how much i knew about their operation\ni convinced the mi was a smuggler and that my name was galen i offered to help them appraise the artefacts that they had stolen will these arent common thieves they are stealing romulan artefacts from archaeological sites throughout this sector baran has me analysing each one if them for a particular particle signature will they are looking for a specific artefact\nthats what we have to find out baran is the key i think that he knows more about what were really looking for than anyone else on this ship i want you to get close to him try and get his confidence\nhe also believes that your e a less than perfect starfleet officer will i want you to play into that role baran and i well he doesnt care very much for me but he has to tolerate me because he needs my help with these artefacts but if you and i become enemies then theres a better chance of you and he becoming friends\ngetting some answers because you cant get him to talk\nwhat calder two isnt just another archaeological site you know its a federation outpost there\nits defended by starfleet you dont think they re just going to stand by while we walk in there and take whatever we want\nthey also have a minimum of two phaser banks and possibly photon torpedoes is that enough to worry about\nbecause i tried to smuggle a sake than glyph stone out of there nearly two years ago i barely got away in one piece\nwhy dont we use riker hesa starfleet commander he could talk us past the outpost security without raising their suspicions then when their shields go down we can be am the artefacts up here without ever leaving the ship\nif he doesnt help us well have to destroy the outpost and kill everyone on it hes still a starfleet officer he wont want to take innocent lives if he can possibly prevent it\ncomputer reset diagnostic for new sample lot number four seven eight b access spectral analysis and begins can mode three\ncomputer reset diagnostic for new sample lot number three six nine b\naccess spectral analysis mode two begins can\nyou can tell baran if he wants the analysis done faster he can do it himself if he wants it done correctly he can wait\ni doubt that hell do that ive increased the accuracy of the identification process by a factor often im the best person to analyse these artefacts baran knows that\ni dont like operating in the dark if i knew what the point of this mission were why i was analysing these relics\ndo you know what all this is about\nthen whats going on here why are we risking our lives taking these artefacts who wants them\nyou can tell baran every word that ive said he knows that i dont think much of him as a leader\nbaran wouldnt last five minutes as captain if he didnt have that control device the crew follow him because they have no choice bar ans power is based on fear and intimidation\nif someone were to challenge him the rest of the crew would follow\nno theres no time for that starfleet will be here any minute\nim configuring the disruptors to fire a phase resonant pulse if i can hit their shield generator with precisely the right frequency i should be able to take it out with one shot firing their shields are down\nthey managed to get their shields backup\ngreat story ill remember it next time im in a knife fight\nany luck\nlets go\nmy friend tells me you know about the man were looking for\nso you can imagine how much this means to me\nand how much might anything be\nthis is my sister shes angry shes got a vicious temper i wouldnt cross her\nyes\nagreed now talk\ncan you establish a reading\nyou didnt say anything about a weapon\ncome\nim all right\ni think you d be better at something like that or beverly she knew him the longest\nyou dont understand i cant give the eulogy because i wont be at the service\nthats exactly the point i dont want to heal\nive an open wound right here it hurts like hell i dont want it to get better and i dont want to pretend that everythings all right\nyour e damn right and i intend to stay angry until i find whoever s responsible for the captains death\nthat is enough counsellor deanna im sorry this is not about revenge this is about justice the captain died in a bar fight for nothing somebody has to answer for that the ni can mourn\nill take it in the ready room\nsir\ni have a request siri would like to conduct an investigation into captain pi cards death\ni know that sir frankly i dont have much confidence in the authorities on des sica two theres every reason to believe that they re corrupt\nthe captains death hit me pretty hard and i may not be completely objective but there is no one who is more determined i wont rest until i find out who s responsible\nthank you sir\nthese are the best quarters we have i was hoping now that youve had a chance to relax you might have remembered some of the details about the aliens you saw something you may have forgotten\nthey murdered a man in cold blood in full view of everyone in the bar and you cant remember anything about them\ndo you know where they went so you know who they are and you know where i can find them\nwhat do you want\na shuttlecraft well heres my offer instead of the ship ill give you some time\nif youre lucky youll only spend the next five years in prison instead of the next twenty you ve got twelve outstanding arrest warrants for fraud and petty theft in the klingon empire tell me what you know and ill pull some strings may be theyll reduce your sentence after you ve been extradited\nill think about it\ntalk\nwhere do we find them\nyou think\nriker to data\ntake us out of orbit set course for the barra das system warp six\nwhats the source\nwhat else do we know about barra das three\nmister worf id like a security detail to accompany the away team to the surface ill lead the team geordi your e with me mister data you have the bridge\nhes not\non the bridge not this time\nensign you take that area\ngeordi\nfrom what\nwhat do you make of these\nit doesnt look like any blast point ive ever seen the shape is too perfect\nlooks as if someone could have just dropped them\nim going to head for those trees over there if i can get there we might be able to set up a crossfire\nwilliam trike r commanders c two three one dash four two seven\nwe were studying the ruins it was a scientific expedition\nthen what were you doing there\nwhat happened to him\nand what riker might that be\nthats right\nive gotten out of them before\nlet me do it ive had a lot of experience with this sort of system failures i might be able to do something\nlooks like you ve got a control logic lockout in your regulator subsystem im going to attempt to run an active by pass through the plasma flow convertor you start running phase lock feedback through that regulator i want about a six second delay\nwell all be dead anyway just need a few more seconds\nif you want to make sure that doesnt happen again you d better reinitiate your regulator sub compressors a full diagnostic of your intermix chamber wouldnt hurt either\nyou still wish you d killed me\ni was looking to find the people who killed you on the surface a witness said they saw you vapor is ed\ni dont understand any of this who are these people what are you doing involved with them\nand then you became part of their crew\nwhy\nthats why you set up the engine failure because you knew that id be able to fix it\nall right ill do what i can\nim aware of that lieutenant but your outpost is in imminent danger of attack i would like to station security personnel on the surface for your protection now im ordering you to drop your shields\nthats ridiculous when did i have a chance\nmister data withdraw the enterprise that san order\nim your commanding officer im giving you a direct order understood\nive never explained my orders before im not about to start now\ni wont let him blow this ship into space if i can set up a low level comm link between the two ships i can use my personal command codes i can deactivate the shields\nit worked the shields are dropping\ncommander no one is allowed on the surface without prior authorisation from the federation science council\nim sorry sir but the regulations are very specific i cant do it if you d like you can remain in orbit until we contact the science council but were experiencing some communication difficulties right now so that\nwatch him\nplasma pressure is rising\ni dont think your e going to have the chance plasma pressure has reached critical levels\nlogic subsystems still not responding\nplasma pressure has exceeded maximum levels eight percent above critical and rising\nplasma pressure is eleven percent above critical the containment fields are beginning to degrade\nplasma pressure is fourteen percent above critical\nplasma pressure is dropping were back into safe levels\nhow do you know so much about this outpost\nthe last time we engaged starfleet we lost a man we cant afford anymore casualties if we can avoid a battle i think we should\nbaran wants to see the analysis of the last lot he thinks you removing a little slowly\ndo you enjoy living dangerously galen baran can kill you in an instant if he activates his control device\nhe may need you now but i know baran and i can tell you hes not going to back down forever you accomplish nothing by provoking him\nif baran felt it were wise to let the crew know that im sure he would have\nwhat baran knows i know\ni see no reason to tell you anything but you can rest assured i dont necessarily share everything i know with baran either this conversation for example will stay between us\nhes been in charge of this crew for a long time\nthat almost sounds like a prelude to mutiny\ni was right you do like living dangerously i like you galen i can tolerate a lot from someone like you but only to a point i intend to complete this mission successfully and get whats been promised me if it looks as though your e getting in the way of that ill deal with you myself\nim scanning i think ive found them\nive lost transporter lock\nwe had business dealing she owes me money\nmaybe we can discuss that possibility but first i have to find him collect the money i mowed\nif i dont find him im going to have to move on are you sure you havent seen him\nyou relying\nhes telling the truth acting captains log stardate 471352 doctor crusher has positively identified captain pi cards dna theres no doubt now that he s dead\nhow are you doing\nthe crews pretty shaken up im arranging a memorial i think you should be the one to deliver the eulogy\ni know its not going to be easy but i think its important that we face up to whats happened youre in command now the crews looking to you for guidance\na memorial service helps to give everyone a sense of completion helps them begin the healing process\nwill\ni know your e angry\nthats pretty selfish of you do you think your e the only one in pain do you think you have the monopoly on loss well let me tell you something were all hurting and were all angry and whether you like it or not you have a responsibility to this crew and you cant just indulge your personal desire for revenge\nthere must be some way we can track it\nthat doesnt make any sense he knows those codes would have been changed as soon as he was captured\nthats right\nthis is a waste of time baran get rid of him now\nstarfleet wont negotiate with us but they ll pursue us as long as we have him\nwere accelerating\ni cant the override sequence wont engage\nwhat are their defences\nwhy would riker help us just because he s out of favour with starfleet doesnt mean that he s ready to betray them\ni think the one over there knows something\nhe would not admit to having seen the captain but he said that anyone who visited the ruins of na fir would probably come here eventually i suspect he knows more\ncommander it old\ni explained to him that we are looking for a man who impregnated your sister\nand how much more latinum will it take to offset this risk\nwho were these aliens\na weapon discharge\ncommander i am receiving a transmission from admiral che kote at starbase two twenty seven\naye sir\nwhich could indicate a base or a ship\ncommander i found something\nsir the mercenaries have beamed a way they must have a base or a ship nearby can the sensors locate anything\nsir they have taken commander riker we must do something we can not just sit here\nthe search teams have reported in they found several archaeological sites each one has been looted\nthe romulans\nthe leader of the group that attacked us was romulan perhaps they are controlling the mercenaries\ndirect hit on their aft deflectors they are undamaged\nopen\ncommander we are receiving some kind of signal from the mercenary ship these are commander rikers access code she is attempting to shut down our shields\nsir we would be totally defenceless\nsir as soon as they see\naye sir\nthe only reason im talking to you is that i have a sister too\nfamily honour is important if someone had defiled my sister i would do anything pay anything to find the one responsible\nas much as five bars of gold pressed latinum\nperhaps there san element of risk here that i did not fully appreciate\nthis isnt about latinum as a man with a sister a sister with a temper i can sympathise with you but how did you come here do you have a ship in orbit\nthen take me with you you can drop me anywhere\nthe man your e looking for was here several weeks ago there was a group of aliens sitting at this table he was asking them questions\ni dont know but they looked dangerous they attacked him he managed to incapacitate three of them before he was knocked down he was thrown against that wall and fell there\nwho are you people\ni hadnt finished yet youll like this them an got what was coming to him when they knocked him down one of them took out a weapon and fired he was vapor is ed\nah commander riker ive been meaning to speak to you i was wondering if you could move me to better quarters i dont care much for the decor here\nsorry my memory isnt what it used to be\nnow that you mention it i do remember one thing they said they d kill anyone who talked about what happened\nperhaps i do\nnot a great deal commander just a shuttlecraft i believe id like to travel for awhile see more of the galaxy you understand\ntime\nif i tell you what i know you must promise not to give me to the klingons\nperhaps you could send me to a federation rehabilitation colony instead\nthe aliens were some kind of mercenary group they ve been operating in this sector for the last six months\ni heard one of them mention the barra das system i think they were headed there\nthats all i know",

better than that im almost ready to get rid of your friend galen\ntheres one more artefact to find once galen confirms that its genuine his usefulness on this ship will come to a very sudden end\ngalen might be a loudmouthed fool but sometimes he s quite perceptive his observations about you for instance\nafter what you did on calder two i doubt if you have much of a future in starfleet\nwell assuming that you were not my prisoner what would you do now\nwell possibly however theres one thing that i have learned on this ship and thats to be cautious and never to blindly embrace what might appear to be good fortune and right now youre a rather large stroke of good luck\nsuch as\nwell its enough to know right now that your share will ensure a very wealthy and long life far from the federation\nit is only your e going to have to earn it and you can start by putting a side your dislike for galen and becoming his friend\ngalen has allies on this ship they could cause trouble if i decide to kill him i want you to find out from him who they are\none more thing riker when the time comes i want you to kill galen\nthe enterprise\nquiet all that matters now is that the enterprise has the second artefact in their possession we dont have a choice well have to board the enterprise and take the artefact\nno i dont but he does\ngalen if youre so worried about riker then you can go on the raiding party and watch him\ndraw weapons and equipment for a raiding party of five\nif you rethinking of betraying us to your friends on the enterprise you might remember that i still have the ability to kill you at the first sign of trouble\ni have an additional task for you one that will prove your loyalty this raid is an opportunity to get rid of galen once youve found that artefact kill him\nset course three one zero mark two one five warp six\nwhere is it\noh really and who would that be galen you hes plotted this all along opposed me at every turn endangered all

still havent find anything out of the ordinary\nid have a hard time defending that as part of a safety inspection\nworf were on pretty shaky ground as it is we cant just\nyou could say that\nin the

remote but i believe we should check\ninform starfleet command that we will hold this position until further notice\nyes but we will continue to pursue all avenues of investigation\nthat is correct but i believe commander riker wanted us to let them escape\npossibly i will attempt to re sequence the signal begin running a search for a decryption key\ni have completed my analysis of the signal from the mercenary ship i believe these groupings represent bearings and coordinates taken from their navigational system\nyes if i am correct the mercenary ship is heading toward these coordinates in the hy r alan sector\nmake it so\nlieutenant may i see you in the ready room\nlieutenant i am dissatisfied with your performance as first officer\nyou continually question my orders in front of the crew i do not believe this is appropriate behaviour\nthat is true but in those situations you were acting as head of security not as first officer the primary role of the second in command is to carry out the decisions of the captain in this case me\nyes but once i have made a decision it is your job to carry it out regardless of how you may personally feel any further objections should be given to me in private not in front of the crew i do not recall commander riker ever publicly showing irritation with his captain as you did a moment ago\nif you do not feel capable of carrying out this role i will assign it to commander laforge and return you to tactical i would not enter it into your record as a reprimand simply as a transfer\nthen i expect you to conform to the guidelines i have laid out\ndismissed mister worf i am sorry if i have ended our friendship\ni would like that as well\nis it the mercenary ship\nopen a channel this is lieutenant commander data of the federation starship enterprise\ni take it that is your name may i inquire as to your destination\nmay i ask the purpose of your journey\nperhaps i have not made our intentions clear we are investigating\nhe seems most uncooperative\naccording to the terms of the klingon federation treaty koral has every right to free transit through federation space we can not board or search his vessel without cause\ni am not sure that using this clause as an excuse to conduct a search would be consistent with the spirit of the treaty\nhowever if koral wishes to contest our actions he can file a protest with the judge advocate generals office bring the shuttle aboard then you and doctor crusher can begin the inspection\nlieutenant worf has programmed our replicators to make a very good approximation of klingon blood wine i believe you will find it to your liking\nif you could tell us something about the nature of your mission\ncommander riker by taking this action you risk charges of assault theft piracy and treason\nsecurity alert medical emergency team to the observation lounge data to bridge raise shields and begin sensor sweeps for the mercenary ship\ni must admit i am experiencing a similar sensation\nwhat will become of the resonator sir\nit is unfortunate it can not be studied the resonator is a key artefact from a remarkable period of history\nif we are to adhere to the exact letter of starfleet regulations then technically sir you have been declared a renegade in fact i believe you are facing twelve counts of court martial offences you can not give orders either sir\naye sir\nthis way sir\naye sir\naye sir\ntheyre preparing to activate their warp drive commander\nim picking up a small vessel bearing one two seven mark three three five\nno sir its a klingon ship\naye sir\nkoral\nno\nno\nhealth and safety inspection\nwhat is this\ncommander i think ive got something ive been studying the comm link commander riker used to transmit his command codes i didnt see anything at first but then iran the transmission through a subharmonic analysis i found this it was sent by the same carrier wave as the command codes\nso you think this is their flightplan\nwe could be there in five\nthe antimatter containment units are starting to buckle\nim taking the engines offline\nit will take at least five hours to replace the antimatter containment unit\ni agree but i dont think thats you\ni dont trust you galen i dont think the rest of the crew does either theyre not going to follow you\nno but they will follow tall era and so willi\nshut your mouth klingon\nhow far\nare you sure galen\nriker turned on us he tried to kill galen before we beamed back\nafter that you can go anywhere you want\nis it all there\ni did not come this far to be cheated i want it all now\nbaran wouldnt last five minutes as captain if he didnt have that control device\nthey captured me to find out how much i knew about their operation\ni convinced the mi was a smuggler will these are not common thieves they are stealing romulan artefacts from archeological sites throughout this sector\nive lost three plasma relays on the disruptors auxiliary power is is not available\nwhats wrong commander you having second thoughts about betraying your comrades because thats what youve done betrayed them betrayed them in order to save yourself you used to be just a second rate officer now youre a traitor and a coward how does that feel\nyou can tell baran that im working as fast as i can what\nyou were there the disruptors lost power computer reset for diagnostic of new sample begins can\ncomputer reset diagnostic for new sample and begins can look this isnt a romulan labour camp i dont have to answer your questions and i dont give a damn what you think\nwell whatever it is were looking for it seems weve found it\nive had some unpleasant surprises will this isnt a good idea baran might grow suspicious\nwhat a tangled web we weave i have difficulty remembering whose side i mon so what have you been able to find out\na second artefact oh by the way that first artefacts is not romulan its vulcan\ni have been looking over the glyphs and pictograms from the calder two artefact and although i dont have enough data to translate all the inscriptions the alphabet and symbology is much more consistent with early vulcan than romulan\ni dont know if i could just get access to the enterprise computer just for a few moments so what will baran do once he s obtained the second artefact\nwill you always seem to be after my job well as soon as baran feels that ive outlived my usefulness he can kill me simply by using the neural servo so i think we had better start planning a mutiny\nwe need a new captain and ive come to one inescapable conclusion\noh\nthen who will they follow you\nwhat\nwhat are you talking about\nvulcan security\nwhat sort of threat\nim captain jean luc picard of the enterprise\nthat sounds like an illogical philosophy\ntell me tall era what are these artefacts we ve been collecting i know that they are vulcan in origin\nyou were much as my people once were savage warlike\nthe stone ofgol\ni know the story from vulcan mythology\nbut according to the legend the stone was destroyed by the gods when the vulcan people found the way to peace\na telepathic weapon\nit would seem that baran has to deliver these artefacts to the assassin in order to get paid therefore you and i should continue our masquerade\nhow could they have found out about the rendezvous commander\ndo you have any idea how many security officers there are onboard a ship like that\noh yes very convenient we beam you back aboard your old ship and we have to take a risk that you wont change your mind and betray us\nagreed\ndont\nits not in here hey you wheres the artefact\nthis is it\nyes i can recognise the inscription pattern from the first artefact\nis he dead\ngood activate the transporter\ni have something else for you baran\ntell him what happened n arik\nhe might have killed all of us and i believe he was acting under direct orders baran you betrayed us this has gone far enough i think it is time that we had a new commander someone who will lead us to those profits that we ve been promised\nfollow your orders the orders of a small man trying to fill a role too big for him i say its time for a change whos with me\nits over baran\nyou cant kill all of us you need us to run the ship more than we need you to command it\ni switched the transponder codes given his feelings about me it seemed a sensible thing to do\nthere ll be no more punishment on this ship now do your duties and ill see to it that we complete our mission and get our payment\nmaintain our present course and speed for now im going to find out when and where were supposed to deliver our cargo\naccording to baran s logs we are to deliver the two pieces to the t karat h sanctuary on vulcan\ngalen to bridge alter course for vulcan\noh i wonder if you can possibly help me with something i have been able to translate most of the writing on these two pieces for the most part theyre warnings of death and destruction to anyone who opposes the resonator but i am not able to determine what appears on the anterior side for example this symbol represents the vulcan god of war and this is the god of death but if you look really carefully you can see a third symbol missing now that obviously should belong to the final piece now whats odd about this is that the gods of death and war would typically always standalone on an artefact they would never be combined with a third glyph\nim really anxious to see the final artefact because it might provide a valuable insight into vulcan mythology\nwell there should be no problem about our entering orbit i asked commander riker to contact the vulcan authorities from the enterprise and let them know that we were approaching\nwell i didnt want to risk a misunderstanding someone might have mistaken this for an actual raid\nperhaps i should contact the enterprise have them meet us at vulcan just in case these isolationists try to escape\ni see do you think its wise for you to go there alone after all they were expecting baran to show up dont you think if i were to accompany you it might seem more plausible\nof course\ntaller a ive decided on a change of plan take one of the artefacts with you leave the other here as soon as we have our payment in full well complete the delivery\ni realise that but its safer for all concerned to leave one behind\nthey ve been waiting a long time for this theyre not going to take any risks now take one of the artefacts and beam down\ntall era is right but what shes not telling you is that those artefacts shes holding are part of an incredibly powerful weapon theres no reward waiting for you down on the surface as soon as she s got those artefacts shell leave you behind to be captured by starfleet\nyoull never get away with this starfleet will never stand and watch you tear apart one of the founding worlds of the federation\nlisten to me all of you drop your weapons do it dont make any aggressive movements the resonator amplifies violent feelings and emotions and thats why you wanted me to pick up the phaser that show you were able to kill n arik and vek or but i can see the symbol on that third artefact and it is the vulcan symbol for peace standing between the symbols for war and death its a warning that the power of the resonator can be overcome by peace\nempty your minds of violent thoughts\nthink taller a two thousand years ago your people were being consumed by war but when peace came to vulcan the resonator became useless thats why it was dismantled\nyou were right tall era the resonator can not be stopped by phasers and shields but it can be defeated by peace captains log stardate 471692 security ministers at ok has taken taller a into custody and begun a search for the rest of the isolationists\nsat ok has assured me that all three pieces will be destroyed\nnormally i would be the first one to agree but perhaps some things best left in the past\noh they will be detained by the vulcan authorities for the moment but they real so facing charges from the klingons the cardassians the ferengi and at least seven other worlds i dont think well be hearing from them for awhile number one will you set course for starbase two twenty seven ill join you on the bridge shortly\nthats quite right and asim supposed to be dead ill go and get some sleep and mister data i suggest that you escort commander riker to the brig\nmy friend tells me you might know about the man were looking for\nthis is about justice the captain died in a bar fight for nothing\nthen what were you doing there\nthen you became a member of their crew\nyour e welcome\ni dont know how did that feel\nthat sounds like good news\nreally\ni cant say im sorry to hear that\noh\nyes i must say ive come to the same conclusion\ni guess id start looking for a new career there must be a place where someone with fifteen years of starfleet technical knowledge would be useful you wouldnt happen to know a place like that\ni havent exactly sworn my undying allegiance to you either baran for instance id like to know a little bit more about the job\nsuch as what you meant by a very profitable mission\nsounds promising\nwhy\nokay\ngood to see you too\nas a matter of fact it was baran who sent me here he told me to pretend to be friendly with you and help you organise a mutiny so he can determine who your supporters in the crew and then eliminate them\nwhen we reach the hy r alan sector were supposed to rendezvous with a klingon transport ship im not sure but i think they may be delivering another of the romulan artefacts to us\nvulcan\ndo these artefacts have some religious or cultural significance something that would make them valuable enough to kill for\nyour e supposed to verify its authenticity and then im supposed to kill you and i take your place\ni could get us on the enterprise i can find the artefact\ni have saved your life twice already galen i would think you d begin to show some gratitude by now\ni havent forgotten\nwatch that door\ni guess you re surprised to see me doctor\nive had a change of profession\nuse your brain they wouldnt be searching the shuttle if they had the artefact koral must have it where is that klingon pilot\ntwelve decks away\nthey wont get the chance well use the transporter in that shuttle well beam directly to the observation lounge sorry about this\nlets go\nquiet does he have it\nreally then i guess adding one more charge wouldnt hurt\nthis is going to take a little time to explain\nput it through in here\nminister i thought i should let you know that the mercenary ship which has been raiding planets in the tau gan sector is probably on its way to vulcan right now\nim sorry its been a difficult couple of days i know that one of your operatives has been on a mercenary ship investigating the possible reassembly of a psionic resonator i didnt want someone to make a mistake and start firing at them when they approach your planet\nonce we realised that you were no longer on the mercenary ship we scanned the surface for your neural implant we tracked the signal into the caverns\nwhats going to happen to the mercenaries\nwait a minute you ve been declared dead you cant give orders around here\ndata he was joking you know that right data back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc copyright 1966 present

understand\ncommander i believe there is a problem we have no operative aboard a mercenary ship\nthat almost sounds like a prelude to mutiny\nthe enterprise has been badly damaged but they still have superior firepower if we remain here we will be destroyed the logical course of action is to withdraw\nim trying to decide if youre incredibly stupid or incredibly smart why didnt you continue to fire on the enterprise when their shields dropped\nive watched you handle the weapon systems before you know exactly how to bypass a problem like that and why do you continue to argue with riker it should be obvious that by alienating riker you also alienate baran and yet you continue to do so why\ntall era to captain\nim in the cargo hold ga lens made a positive t erik on match on\none of the artefacts\nunderstood taller a out\nwho are you\nyou reno smuggler and i dont think your names galen you will tell me who you really are and what you are doing on this ship ori will kill you right here\ni will not play games with you i found the message you sent to the enterprise when riker was using his command codes to drop their shields you sent them a transmission on the same carrier wave your e a starfleet officer do not deny it it is the only logical conclusion my name is actually tpa a land i am a member of the vs har\nthat is correct i infiltrated this ship a year ago posing as a romulan mercenary im here to investigate a possible threat to vulcan\nfirst things first galen who are you\nvery well to answer your question for several years now there has been a small but growing movement of extreme isolationists on vulcan a group that believes contact with alien races has polluted our culture and is destroying vulcan purity this group advocates the total isolation of vulcan from the rest of the galaxy and the eradication of all alien influences from our planet\nagreed but extremists often have a logic all their own\ni am sure you are familiar with the ancient history of my people before we found logic before we found peace\nthere was even a time when we used our telepathic abilities as a weapon a time when we learned to kill with a thought\nyou know of it\nthe stone ofgol is real but there is nothing supernatural or magical about it it is a psionic resonator a device which focuses and amplifies telepathic energy it is one of the most devastating weapons ever conceived\nthe resonator was believed to have been destroyed during the time of the awakening only one piece is known to have survived and it was placed in a vulcan museum under heavy guard a year ago that piece was stolen from the museum soon after mercenary ships began raiding archaeological sites across the quadrant we believe a member of the isolationist movement is attempting to reassemble the resonator\nmy orders are to find that assassin and stop him\nagreed but captain i can not allow the resonator to be assembled if necessary i will destroy this ship it screw all of us to prevent that from happening acting captains log stardate 471601 the enterprise is entering the hy r alan sector which i believe to be the next destination of the mercenary ship\nwhat happened\nbaran was nothing we have a mission to complete and the crew needs a leader\nremove that\ni know that place it was an underground stronghold for one of the factions during the last civil war its been abandoned for centuries\nfascinating but i am not an archaeological expert\nwhen we arrive at vulcan i will take these pieces to a secure holding area before going on to the sanctuary i prefer to go alone it will arouse less suspicion on the part of the isolationists\nwhy did you do that\nit was a wise precaution\nyour offer is appreciated but our security forces are more than adequate\ncaptain i do understand your human emotional need to be there at the final moment but this is a vulcan matter\nthank you\nthat was not the agreement\nthey will not pay us until they get both pieces\nthat is all i was waiting for go to the navigational computer and check file one three seven slash omega you ll find a message secretly transmitted to the enterprise containing our entire flightplan\nthe message was sent by galen hesa starfleet officer\nagreed bring him as well well use him as a hostage if starfleet arrives if not well kill him on the surface\nthere your reward as promised\nthat is all i could manage i suggest you take it and leave\nvery well you will get what you deserve\ngo ahead captain pick up the phaser see what good it will do\nhow little you understand what you refacing captain your e used to fighting enemies like yourself people on ships with defence shields energy weapons warp drives but this is unlike anything youve ever faced this is the power of the mind pick up the phaser captain\nyou are about to see how wrong you are\nno\nwill must ve done something to their weapons\nive gone over every word every inflection every facial response and i still cant find any kind of code or hidden message\nill keep trying\nit might be the message we ve been looking for\nhe may have been curt but he was also very worried and even a little scared\nhealth and safety inspections\nim sure the health and safety inspection wont last much longer and in the meantime im really glad that we have this opportunity to get to know you may i ask what business youre in\nyes\nhes all right hes only stunned\nthere san incoming message its from the klingon shuttle it was sent approximately fifteen minutes ago he sat the rendezvous coordinates but he s been detained by the enterprise thats all there is hes stopped transmitting\norders\naye captain\nunderstood\nwe have entered orbit of vulcan\nshes right\ni dont care what it is you want taller a i dont care if thats a weapon for your personal use or if youre really just making a delivery as planned all i care about is my money so i propose a compromise nari kandi will go with you to the surface to guarantee that we receive our payment\nno this is less than half of what we were promised wheres the rest of it\nsir we would be totally defenceless\ndirect hit to the port nacelle only minimal damage hit to the starboard nacelle still no appreciable damage\naye sir\nsir we can not be able to track them with our sensors if they go to warp i can still disable them\ntwo starships have been sent to intercept the mercenaries at ya dalla prime and draken four in case they attempt to attack those planets\nso we are just going to remain here\nif we had not let them to escape this would not be necessary\ntheir maximum speed is warp eight points even it will take them at least fourteen hours to reach that position\nfinally set course for the hy r alan sector and engage at warp nine\nof course\nmay i a skin what way\nwith all due respect siri have always felt free to voice my opinions even when they differ from those of captain picard or commander riker\nbut is it not my duty to offer you alternatives\nno sir\ni would prefer to remain at my current post\naye sir\nsir it is i who has jeopardised our friendship not you if you will overlook this incident i would like to continue to consider you my friend\nthank you sir\nat or on class shuttlecraft one person\nsir may i recommend that we bring the shuttle aboard with our tractor beam search it and interrogate koral\nyes sir however the treaty does give us the right to conduct health and safety inspections of any ship in our space\nyes sir\naye sir\nhe must be hiding something we should download his computer memory and analyse it\nwe could claim that the computer was generating abnormal radiation signatures\nwhat is going on\ni do not know what your e talking about\nsecurity will not allow you to get that far\nworf to commander riker ministers at ok of vulcan

not possible\ndo you really think it is possible\ndaily\nthank you counsellor i look forward to our next meeting\ni am currently running a level three diagnostic of the relays sir we will have the results of the analysis in approximately ten minutes\nhold very still counsellor\ni believe i had another waking dream sir but this time i had an uncontrollable urge to eliminate the image i saw\nyes sir for a reason i can not explain i had the need to destroy it\nno sir i saw a straw coming out of your head\nas i said before these are all images i originally experienced in my dream programme i do not have a rational explanation for them\na sensible precautions ir\nof course may i ask a personal favour\nwill you take care of spot for me\ni am afraid if i have another waking dream i might injure him\nunlike a canine spot does not respond to verbal commands goodbye spot he will need to be fed once a day he prefers feline supplement number twenty five\nand he will require water and you must provide him with a sandbox and you must talk to him tell him he is a pretty cat and a good cat\nperhaps that will be enough\nit is an interesting hypothesis if i am being affected by these inter phasic creatures on an unconscious level it may also explain my waking dreams and my subsequent anti social behaviour\ni see the concept is similar to the method of directed dreaming\nyes sir\ni understand sir initiating dream programme standby\nhello\ncake\nit is cellular peptide cake\nstop you must not hurt my friends\ni believe i understand\ngeordi\nyou must adjust my positronic sub processor to emit an inter phasic pulse\nthe workmen in my dreams represent the organisms which are trying to demolish the ship the incessant ringing of the telephone freud s cautions at the other end were warnings of the dangers around us\nmy positronic sub processor detected high frequency inter phasic signatures from the organisms which were symbolically represented in my dreams by a high shriek\nthat is why i have asked geordi to adjust my subprocess or if i can produce a high frequency inter phasic pulse it may have a similar effect on the creatures\nenter\ncounsellor i did not have a chance to apologise for my actions\ni wonder what would doctor freud say about the symbolism of devouring oneself\ntell me more about this cake\nher upper body describe the knife you used to cut the counsellor\nhow long\nand what happened next\nand did you\ni believe you are experiencing a classic dismemberment dream or in your case being a mechanical mana dismantlement dream\nyour mechanistic qualities are trying to reassert themselves over your human tendencies ego and id struggling for domination the workmen symbolise the ever present id constantly working to destroy the ego now the image of counsellor troia female is devoured by you clearly indicating an unconscious desire to possess your own mother\ndo not interrupt the knife in its violent connotation suggests a certain feeling of sexual inadequacy\nach impotence on top of everything it is all becoming clear to me now there might be a paper in this\nclassic transference your anger toward me is in fact the animosity you feel toward your father you are a polymorphous ly perverse individual mister data and i recommend full psychoanalysis i believe i can fit you in next tuesday\nkill them you must kill them all before its too late\nkill them\nkill them before it is too late\ni am doctor sigmund freud\nif i were to interpret my own appearance in this dream i would say i am the symbolic representation of data sun conscious mind trying to warn him about the danger she perceives around him\nof course\nanswer it nien nien nien do not be so literal when i say answer i time an respond to it to them\ndata there you are we need to install that plasma conduit right away were bringing the new warp core online in less than three hours\ngreat ill meet you in engineering as soon as you refinished there this ought to be a lot of fun\nyeah sure data everybody does from time to time\nnightmares are part of dreaming data may be youve just discovered another new level to your programme\nwell its perfectly normal data sometimes when i have a nightmare i cant shake that weird feeling for a couple of days\nspeaking of nightmares\nthats great ensign thank you\nill tell you what why dont you help farrell check the deuterium cartridges im just about to bring the warp core online all right\nshes enthusiastic all right about me\nshes got a crush on me data\nexactly and quite frankly its beginning to get a little bit uncomfortable\nyeah something like that\nno data ill take care of it myself thanks\nwere ready to bring the new core online captain standby all right lets do it initializing deuterium infusion sequence its a thing of beauty isnt it now lets see how fast she can run laforge to bridge\nwarp power at your discretion captain\nim on it sir theresa warp plasma conduit out of alignment but i think ive got it fixed now ready sir\nstandby captain\nlaforge to bridge im sorry sir but were going to have to reconfigure this plasma conduit its going to take at least a couple of hours sir\nwhen you didnt show up on time in engineering i got worried\ni cant find anything wrong with your internal time base as far as i can tell your primary systems check out fine\nyou know data theres an awful lot we dont know about your dream programme maybe it was designed to cause side effects i mean for all we know doctor soong might have intended for you to oversleep from time to time its part of the human experience\nyou know im curious what were you dreaming about when we woke you up\nsounds like it must have been pretty strange\nlaforge to bridge\nweve just started it up captain all systems are holding steady\nready when you are sir\nit looks like weve blown the entire power converter captain impulse engines are down too were not going anywhere but i know just how to fix this give me two three hours tops\nnow what\ntyler how re you coming with that relay diagnostic\nno data i havent had the time listen i want you to take this brace coil and run a metallurgical scan on it for me see if there are any micro fractures\nsomething wrong data\ndata data whats wrong\nyes captain two hours ago\nno sir please dont touch that captain commander data and i have the situation under control now if you d just let us care of it the work would go much faster\ngood work tyler i thought he d never leave data i want you to give me a hand locking down this plasma conduit data data\ncaptain weve run every possible diagnostic on data s positronic net we can think of we cant find anything wrong i could run a sub polymers can but it would take some time to set up the equipment\nweve tried em radiation subspace fields thermal protons nothings worked they seem to exist in some sort of inter phasic state just beyond our range of visual and sensor acuity the only way we can see them is to use an ip scanner tricorder scant even pick them up\nthose images are all part of data s dream may be somehow hes unconsciously perceiving these creatures\nwhat we want to do data is link your neural net into the holodeck and have you activate your dream programme so as you dream we can observe the dream images\nwed need about an hour to establish all the interface parameters\ni think were ready captain the link is active the holodeck has been calibrated to datas neural net\nright\nhe should be perceiving us as just another part of his dream anything we say to him will be taken in that context\nin his waking dream he said that there was a mouth on her shoulder\ncellular peptides thats exactly what the creatures are extracting\nyes its for you\nhow does he fit into all this\ni dont know but i do recognise that junction theyre working on its the plasma conduit we installed with the new warp core\nwhat is it that you redoing\nyes data\nwere ready\nthis conduit was manufactured on thanatos seven using a new inter phasic fusion process we think it was that process which attracted the organisms to the conduit where they lay dormant until we activated the warp core thats also why we couldnt get the core online the creatures were disrupting the plasma flow\nwell were going to have to manufacture a new conduit thats at least six hours work\ni can try and speed things up a bit\nunderstood sir\nwere on our way\ncaptain we were expecting you this morning is there a problem\nyour e not trying to avoid this particular engagement are you picard\ngood ill expect you soon nakamura out\nlet me guess your new warp core is malfunctioning again\nare you expecting to have this problem fixed soon or shall we send out a tow ship to bring you in\ni just got a message from starfleet command\nyou could say that ive been invited to the annual starfleet admirals banquet\nive managed to avoid it for the past six years but now it would seem my luck has run out i cant think of anything more tedious fifty admirals shaking hands making dull conversation uninteresting food boring speeches\nafter six years number one i dont think i have any excuses left\nbridge to commander laforge whats our status\nacknowledged ensign gates set course for starbase two nineteen warp six engage\nengage bridge to engineering mister laforge why isnt my ship\nmoving\nvery well ensign gates\nmister laforge\non screen\nadmiral\nactually we have been experiencing a few minor difficulties with our new warp core but my chief engineer assures me that we will be underway within the hour\nno no certainly not im really looking forward to it\ngo ahead geordi\nensign gates set a course and engage\nengineering report\nmister worf open a channel to starbase two nineteen advise admiral nakamura ill be a little later than i thought\nadmiral i can explain\nunfortunately the problem has affected our impulse systems at the moment we are adrift\nthat will not be necessary i have full confidence in my engineering staff i will be at the banquet on time picard out\nhave you tried reconfiguring the plasma conduits\nwhat about the relays are you absolutely certain you dont need a new phase invertor\ni see oh perhaps i could reconfigure these iso linear chips\nohno not at all id be delighted\nand what you saw was some sort of a mouth on trois shoulder\na straw\nmister laforge\nmake it so in the meantime mister data ill have to relieve you of duty and confine you to your quarters\nwhat is it\nall right is there any way that we can affect these organisms\nwhat about mister data there must be some connection between his odd behaviour and these creatures is he infested as well\ndata attacked counsellor troi because he saw a mouth on her shoulder and in that same area that we first saw one of the organisms\nthen perhaps it is time that we took a closer look at mister data s dreams\nperhaps we can learn more about these creatures by interpreting the symbols and images of your dreams\nexactly how soon can you have the link ready\nmake it so in the meantime mister data i suggest that you should prepare for bed\nready mister data\nnormally i would wish you pleasant dreams but in this case bad dreams would be more helpful\nlets be very observant even the most insignificant image could be a very important symbol\nhere he comes\ncan we speak to data directly or would that wake him up\nyou know that sounds like a telephone ringer but i dont see a receiver\no her thank you look at that her right shoulder that is the same place that data stabbed her\ntheyre both symbols of consumption mouth food mister data what kind of cake is this\nwhat could the ringing symbolise a bell sound an old fashioned way of communicating\npicard\nkill who\nwho is this\nyou mean the inter phasic organisms\ntell me doctor how do we kill them\nwhat do they represent\nrespond respond to them what does that mean\nwho are you\ndata the shrieking noise you made it causes them pain\ndata whats going on\nwhat about the shrieking noises that you made\nwhen you made those noises the workmen reacted in pain\npicard to sickbay beverly were going to be sweeping the ship with a high frequency ip pulse will you monitor the creatures for any response\nhow long before we have warp power again\nsix hour the banquet will be completely over by then thats very unfortunate\nnon ono i wouldnt want to sacrifice the safety of the ship\nsomething wrong sir\nbad news\nmy condolences\ncant you think of some excuse to get out of it\narent you going to answer that mister data\nthat damn ringing answer it will you\ni think he son to you sir\ntalk about going nowhere fast\nare you going to answer that commander\nwhat are you waiting for answer it\ni just wanted to broaden his horizons besides he likes it\nworf its better than music its jazz\nmedical emergency deck seventeen section three alpha\nwhat about me did you see one of those mouths on my head as well\nwhat are we dealing with here are these creatures feeding on us\ndo we know where these things came from mister worf\ndata also saw a straw in my head and then beverly discovered an organism in the same place\nwill someone answer that damn ringing captain the ringing is getting worse\nwill somebody please get that\nhello data\nwhat are you doing\ni understand youve had some interesting dreams recently geordi was worried about you and he wanted me to check in and see how you were doing\nbecause of the nightmares\ndata you shouldnt be afraid of dark imagery in your dreams its a natural expression of your unconscious if you have an unconscious im not really sure how your positronic brain works but if its anything like ours then there s part of you thats trying to express itself through your dream state and i think you should allow yourself to experience it as sigmund freud said dreams are the royal road to the knowledge of the mind\nlet me know how it goes goodnight data\nplease dont hurt me data\nno dont no no data\ndata data\nwe ve been trying to wake you up for the last five minutes\ndata if you were one of my human patients i might be concerned right now id say you had a waking dream or an hallucination but your e not human i think we might be looking at some kind of technological problem\ndata even freud said sometimes a cigar is just a cigar but the bottom line is i think your e developing an almost obsessive interest in your own inner workings id almost call it the beginnings of a neurosis\nwhy not youve eliminated all the technical explanations and it makes sense that as your neural net becomes more complex more human that you might experience the same kind of psychological complexities as a human\ndata you must be the first person who s come into my office and been excited at the prospect of a new neurosis but yes i do think its possible and id like to start counselling you on a regular basis\nno well start weekly and as a first step id like you to shut down your dream programme until our next session just to be on the safe side give yourself a chance to reflect on this experience\nand data next time see me before you see sigmund\ndeck thirtysix\nhello data are you all right\nwhat are you doing\nno\ndata\ndata\nwhat is it\ndata dont worry about it geordi explained everything to me it wasnt your fault but somehow i thought turnabout would be fair

    "episode 157": "you refine but your psi los y nine levels are a little low\nits been depleted by your work with the cairn your e going to have to try to avoid telepathic communication for awhile\nwhy\nl wax an aim sorry but your e going to have to take some time and rest\nshes not responding to cortical stimulation im not sure what else i can do\nits so strange its almost as if her brain has shut itself down\nim running a sub neural scan as far as i can see theres no tissue damage no neurochemical imbalance no sign of infection nothing\nthe only exception is in the para cortex activity there is almost off the scale\nits a possibility\nhave you been able to sort any of it out\nmeta conscious\nhas your mother mentioned anything that happened to her lately something that might have been traumatic for her\nma ques could be wrong about this theres still a chance that a sub neural scan might be able to pinpoint an physiological cause for your mothers condition something that i might be able to treat the results wont be in until morning maybe we should all try and get some rest\nall right\nif we could decipher these images we might be able to determine whether or not your mothers condition was induced by a traumatic event\nill be monitoring her throughout the entire procedure if anything goes wrong ma ques can break the telepathic link\nand i havent found a physiological cause for whats happened to your mother which makes me feel that ma ques was right when he said that your mothers condition was precipitated by a traumatic event\ndoes your mother keep personal logs or a journal\nthank you deanna you understand that if your para cortical readings go too high again im going to tell ma questo sever the connection\nit is often the case that children learn languages more easily than adults\nmrs troi\nperhaps we are being too literal i have recently learned in my study of dream analysis that people who appear in a dream can sometimes represent different aspects of the person who is dreaming\nlike my vocal enhancer it helps me make sounds\nwhat\narbor means tree\nheaven\nyes is it my fault\ni make her sad\nbecause its true\ncounsellor i hope

minutes\nmommy\ni have to go now\nits called a visor it enables me to see\nwell she must be here somewhere\ni dont know what they d have done without me first i had to learn how they communicate it was an absolutely exhausting process\nquite different from beta zed telepathy we transmit words with the cairn its images a flood of them all at the same time its overwhelming\nactually its a very efficient way of communicating if two cairn were having this conversation it would have been over minutes ago\nof course they realise that they ll want to communicate verbally if they join the federation dome a favour introduce yourself to one of them engage him in conversation they need the practice\ni see youve already met my star pupil he dr ils picked up spoken language much faster than the others\ndeanna was quite good at languages when she was little where is deanna\nhe dril darling\ngo find your father dear i want to talk to him\nyes yes just a little tired this constant telepathy with the cairn im fine really arent you going to mingle mister woof\ndont worry the cairn couldnt read your thoughts even if they wanted to your brain isnt sophisticated enough neither is yours dear they can only communicate with other telepaths have either of you seen deanna\ndeanna dear come with me i want you to meet the senior diplomat of the cairn delegation maquest his is the beautiful

experience with their form of telepathy\ni suppose we could do that and if they dont understand something ill explain it to them telepathically\ni suppose you re right\nim only trying to help dear\nim

yesterday\nmy words they were confused\nnot in everything she has an image of you in her mind she shared it with me you are even more beautiful the way my people communicate it is direct nothing is hidden\nyour mother is the first to learn our telepathy\nno to communicate with her is very different\nalways there is a part of her that uma part of her that is dark\na part of her that can not be seen do you understand\nshe called it a moment privacy\nthis is privacy\nit is normal\nif this is your way i am relieved\ni will leave now\ni am glad to have stopped also\nplease what is a poem\nyes i

frightened she may resist you\nno\nit must have been\ni can imagine\nreally\nid be happy to\nis there a physiological cause\nyet her neural activity is practically nonexistent\nmight there be some side effect of cairn telepathy of which were unaware\ni think its time that you and i had a talk with ma ques\nma ques is it possible that your telepathic communications with mrs troi harmed her in some way\ncounsellor stop it\nis ma ques suggesting that your mothers meta conscious has been somehow damaged\nma ques what were you doing in sickbay\nwas he trying to contact her telepathically\nand if you succeed can you use that information to help your mother\nif her psyche has collapsed in on itself could accessing her mind pose any danger to you\ncounsellor can you hear me\ndeanna doctor crushers become concerned that your para cortical readings have become erratic\nyes i want you to sever your connection to your mother\nim asking you that is an order counsellor\nleave me alone

just come from sickbay doctor crusher feels that your mothers condition is worsening her neural foundations are getting weaker have you had any luck here\nis this your father\nhe had a kind face\ndeanna your mother might still come out of this\nyou said you d reviewed her journals for the past five years maybe we should go further back\nthen lets start at the beginning the first entry seems to be stardate 306201\nthats odd theresa seven year gap\nand if im not mistaken it ends a few months after your birth\nshe didnt the files were deleted by your mother almost thirty years ago\nshe was working but she said she would be speak of the devil\nshes under a lot of stress shes preparing the cairn to meet with the federation council\nmaybe you just need to sit and talk with her\nmrs troi\nsorry im late i lost track of the time\nhello pleased to meet you\nwell ma ques what do you think of the enterprise\nim glad you think so\nyouve learned a great deal in a very short time im sure it wont be long before your words do justice to your thoughts\nneed\nwhy did you do that mother you embarrassed both of us\nmother dont start\ndeck eight\nmother stop it\nare you coming\nwhats wrong\nno things going to happen to me\nmy first appointment isnt for a few minutes why dont we talk for awhile\nare you sure\nma ques\nyou dont have to\nit wasnt your fault please my mother misled you\nyes\nyou mean youve never had telepathy with someone who wasnt cairn\nin what way\ndark\nim not sure have you ask my mother about this\nof course you said among the cairn nothing is hidden we value honesty but we dont always share everything were thinking and feeling\nyes\nfor us yes\nit is our way\nim glad you stopped by\ni was all set for another round of arguing when all of a sudden she just fell apart\nits more than that im been sensing very erratic emotions from her even the clothes she swearing are unusual they reso subdued\nmother\nthats enough\nyour e coming with me\nits a neurotransmitter involved in telepathy\nmay be i can help with the cairn\nthen i wont use telepathy well work verbally\nno youll work verbally too the point is for you to get some rest mother besides itll do them good to have to figure things out with words\nthis is the ships arboretum\nvery good he dril this is where people come to relax enjoy themselves in a natural setting\nflowers of all hue and without thorn the rose its an old earth poem by john milton\npoetry is an art form that uses words put together in new and unexpected ways sometimes in rhyme milton was speculating that in heaven roses wouldnt have thorns\no her heaven is well its how can i put it\nmother your e supposed to be avoiding telepathy\nyou dont look well\ndont worry shell be fine this is something i think you ll find interesting its a jewel plant from fol nar three the plant secretes ares in which is collected within the blossom by the time the bloom has faded the resin has hardened into a rare and beautiful gem\nmother\nmother troi to sickbay medical emergency in the arboretum\ni dont understand she was fine just yesterday\nthe para cortex is the beta zoid telepathic lobes he communicated with ma ques telepathically just before she fell\nwhat thoughts take your time\ni dont understand\nits all right im fine he was just trying to communicate with me telepathically\nim not sure\nhe communicated so much to me that at first it was just a jumble of images\ni think so during his telepathic contact with my mother ma ques sensed what he calls a dark place he tried to tell me about it before in my office and i misunderstood i thought he was talking about thoughts my mother was keeping private but what he meant was that there was something happening in her met conscious mind\nits a part of the beta zoid psyche its a kind of filtering mechanism that protects us from psychic trauma\nhe feels that whatever is wrong with her is centred there if he s right it may mean that she s suffered some kind of trauma that her meta conscious just cant tolerate\nno nothing\nid like to stay here with her im going to try to contact her telepathically\nmother can you hear me please come back to me please\nmother\nhow how can i help you\ntell me mother please\ncomputer lights\nwhat are you doing\nhow what were you trying to do\nyes\ntell me telepathically\nma ques believes my mothers psyche has collapsed in on itself that for some reason she has retreated into her meta conscious mind\nyes he was able to access images being generated by her meta conscious but he couldnt make any sense of them\nhe saw faces he didnt recognize events he couldnt interpret\nma ques feels he can provide a telepathic bridge that will allow me to access my mothers meta conscious if he can i might be able to find out what happened to her\nim not sure but i do know that theresa part of her that wants to be helped when i tried to contact her telepathically i heard a voice calling out to me\ntheres no way to know id like to try\ni understand\nmother\ncaptain\nare you talking to me from sickbay\nwhy dont you ask ma questo do it\nyour e not captain picard\nthis isnt real none of this is real\ndaddy\ndont do this\nyour e not my father your e part of my mothers mind what is this place\ndid i live here\ni dont remember these toys\ni do remember i always felt safe when you sang to me\ndown in the valley\nno your e just trying to keep me here keep me from finding something\ni have to help her\nshe called out to me she does want me to help\ngoodbye daddy\nhe dril\nmother\nno\nhe dril i asked your father to bring you here because i wanted to talk to you about something you know that l wax an as sick dont you\nno not at all but i believe that she s been thinking about you do you know why\nwhy do you say that\ndo you have any idea why he dril would make my mother sad\nwell thankyou for coming to talk to us ill see you later all right\nthankyou he dril so do i\ni just dont understand how she fits into all this\ni dont think so my mother never mentioned her\nyes she does ill contact mister hom non beta zed and ask him to transmit a copy as soon as possible there maybe some clues there\nthats right a child might represent vulnerability he dril may depict some fragile part of my mother\nyes you the wolf my father it was though she were summoning all her defences to keep me away but keep me away from what what is she protecting\ncome in\nhello captain\nno nothing ive gone through all her belongings read her journal from the last five years and other than the fact that im not married yet nothing bad seems to have happened to her\nyes\ni remember when he died my mother had to go through all his things and pack them away i was seven i remember thinking how mad hed be when he came home and saw what shed done i didnt understand he was nt coming back\nif we cant figure out whats wrong with her captain i dont think she will but i dont know what else to do ive talked with mister hom n whos known her for years ive checked her medical records ive made enquiries to the government on beta ze dive contacted her closest friends if she s been through some kind of psychic trauma theres just no evidence of it\nthats a lot to review my mothers kept a journal since before she was married\nthats the year they were married\nit starts about a year after the wedding\nmy mothers so diligent about her journal why would she have stopped making entries for so long\ni dont understand any of this captain i have to go back inside my mothers mind its the only way were ever going to get any answers\ni know\nhe dril be careful\nwait i want to talk to you\nmother\nnoi want to help you why did you delete parts of your journal did something happen to you you dont want me to know about\nwho she dril mother why is she here is he dril me when i was a little girl\ndid you let something happen to someone was it here at el nar\ntell me whatever it is we can face it together\nyou can we can\nkes tra\nwhat happened mother what happened next\nyou have to you cant hold it back its killing you\nyou have to forgive yourself mother you have to let go\nit was a terrible tragedy the worst thing that can happen to any parent i know you feel responsible but it was an accident and what you redoing isnt fair toke stra\ni saw a little girl who was sweet and happy she must have brought a great deal of joy to your lives\nisnt it better to remember her like that i just found out i had a sister i never knew id like to learn what was good and joyous about her to celebrate her life not mourn it\nke straw as here a few moments ago talk to her\ndo it mother tell her how you feel ill be here with you ill help you\nmister hom n said he saved it in case someday you wanted to

    "episode 158": "he is all right\nall right\nis your face dirty\ni love firelight\nthis morning she was fifteen minutes late thats the third time this week jean luc you dont have the slightest idea what im talking about do you\nive been telling you about nurse ogawa and ensign marks on for the last fifteen minutes\nare you worried about this mission with the kes\nfirst of all the kes are not half the planet theyre nearly three quarters of it and the pry tt are not being left out they themselves simply dont want to have contact with anyone from the outside not the federation or anyone else\nby all indications thekes are a very unified very progressive people\nwell think about earth what if one of the old nation states say australia had decided not to join the world government in twenty one fifty would that have disqualified us as a federation member\nwait until tomorrow i have something very special planned its a vulcan dish thats all ill say\nwhat happened\nthe last thing i remember we were beginning to transport\njean luc\nlet me see\nit looks like an implant it seems to be connected directly to the brain stem\nwhatever it is i doubt its designed for our health\nif you tell us why youve taken us hostage we might be able to\nwhat\ni was just thinking about how to get out of here\nright\nwell at least this means we wont starve to death\nim beginning to think negatively jean luc\nmy tricorder\nyes except some things been added to the main directory\nan escape route that guard must be working for the kes\nif you ask me id like to take my chances out there\nyes the codes been entered\nits alava flow its about thirty metres below us it says we should go this way i smell gas\nthis whole chamber is filled with pockets of a methanogenic compound\ni think so\ni didnt say anything there might be a fairly regular pattern to these eruptions we should be able to navigate out way through them if were careful\nnow\nthe gas is building up\nmaybe we took a wrong turn\nso ami\nim thirsty too\ni heard you you said im very thirsty\nyou were thinking it\nthe implants must be transmitting our thoughts what ami thinking\ni cant hear your thoughts either maybe it was a fluke\nyes we need to go up\ntheres a ledge about thirty metres up that should lead to another tunnel that connects up to the surface\nso much for that being a fluke\nif you sensed a fear of heights you sensed pretty accurately\nright\nthat would be me\nwhat do you want me to think about\nmy grandmother used to make it with peas carrots and\nim sorry\ni didnt say that you were i may have thought it but theres a difference\nstray daydreams scattered minutiae i wonder how true telepaths sift through it all how can they really get to what someones thinking if the minds keeps churning all this flotsam to the surface that is not funny\ni think our link is getting stronger\ncertainly not\njean luc\ni was suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea\ntheres nothing wrong with either of us may be the air is toxic\nim not sure whether we should go over this hill or that one the topography on this map is a little vague\nyou dont really know do you\ni mean you reacting like you know exactly which way to go but your e only guessing do you do this all the time\nim sorry im sorry i just couldnt resist\nwell at least ive trained myself not to say it anymore when i was a little girl my mouth was always landing me in trouble with my parents my teachers\nthats right i had one date with him which i brought to an abrupt halt with the words is that a beard or\nyes i thought i was being cute but i really hurt him that was a long time ago i learned a valuable lesson\nvery wed better get going\ni dont think so either maybe we can find another way to reach the village\nim beginning to think there s not a single thing on this planet we can eat\nremember that vulcan dish i promised you for breakfast i was just you hate having breakfast with me\nyes it is when i said breakfast i heard you say i hate that\nwell then what did you mean\nwhat ive been choosing for breakfast recently\ncoffee and croissants thats all you really want isnt it coffee and croissants well why didnt you just say so\nnoi usually prefer something simple myself but i thought you might enjoy more variety well i guess its coffee and croissants for both of us from now on\ni remember when jack and i took wesley on his first camping trip to balfour lake wesley kept throwing manta leaves in the fire watching them pop jack kept telling him what jean luci heard you dont push it away when i said jack and ii felt this sudden wave of something i didnt know you felt that way\ni guess i always knew that there was an attraction between us right from the start but i never knew how strongly you felt why didnt you ever tell me you were in love with me\nthen when the months went by and the three of us began spending more time together\nand when jack died you felt guilty\nthats why you didnt want me on the enterprise seven years ago\nand now were friends\nwell we still have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow we should get some sleep\nlets go\ni think i can use the tricorder to set up a multiphase pulse that should weaken the field enough to let us through\nright\nim working as fast as i can\nthat was wonderful\ndont get me wrong jean luc but im glad were not joined at the hip anymore\njust tired of bumping into you every thirty seconds i was beginning to feel as if you were part of my uniform\nfreedom penny for your thoughts\nso do i it was very intimate you know last night i couldnt sleep\ni was awake for several hours and thanks to the implants i got to hear some very interesting dreams of yours\nwhat about when he s awake\nwhat do you mean\nno i dont the implants been removed remember\nor perhaps we should be afraid i think i should be going now\ngoodnight\nthere is nothing wrong with the transporter i have run a complete diagnostic of all the targeting components\na concentration of anti graviton particles suggests a tractor beam it might have deflected the transporter beam to a different set of coordinates\nthe tractor beam originated somewhere in the pry tt alliance\ni have scanned the entire pry tt communications system this appears to be the primary access module for the central government\ni believe so sir however the pry tt have no link designed for extraterritorial communication our hail may come as a quite surprise to them\nno sir\nacknowledged enterprise we have lowered our defense shield\nthis is security relay station one we are ready to receive your captain and medical officer\nnegative enterprise they are not here\nyou are not hostages you are prisoners\nyou are being held under the authority of the pry tt security ministry the charges are conspiring with the enemy\nwere not fools we are aware of the federation attempt to establish a military alliance with the kes it will not be tolerated\nthere is no point in trying to mislead us captain the devices which have been implanted in your cerebral cortex es will soon be calibrated to your psi wave pattern at that time we will be able to get all the information we need\nwe shall see\nenterprise this is security minister lorin you will immediately cease all attempts at communication with our people\nthere is nothing to discuss if you do not terminate these transmissions we will be forced to take aggressive action against your ship\nenterprise i have warned you about these unauthorised communications\nthat is your misfortune we have nothing to say to either of you\ni should have known that anyone willing to deal with the kes would be capable of such an outrage\nif that is an attempt to hide your military alliance with the federation you need nt bother i already know far more than you can imagine\ni will not sit at a table with him\ni am not authorised to talk with a kes official\nwe are already aware of your plan to use federation technology to build new attack satellites you will find that we are prepared for them\nwe have been over this before kol rod clearly belongs to the pry tt who originally\ncorrect\nthey are still charged with spying commander i have heard nothing here which would alter that\nvery well transmit their coordinates to the enterprise transporter room\ncommander on behalf of my government i would like to take this opportunity to present my profound apologies regarding this unfortunate incident\ni agree we are prepared to insert a hostage rescue team into the pry tt capital city on three hours notice\ni dont believe there is any diplomatic option commander we have no formal relations with the pry tt no ambassadors theres simply no way to contact them\nwe have never had need of such a system\nallow me to be blunt the pry tt area fanatical xenophobic people with little regard for civilised discourse even if you do establish communications link with them it will be a complete waste of time\nalmost a century\nwe have had other less formal contacts with the pry tt contacts we can not discuss but i can assure you they have changed very little\nof course commander in the meantime i will continue making preparations for a rescue attempt\ni do have one request we believe that the pry tt obtained their information about the transport of your captain and doctor through a breach in our communications network if i could set up a base of operations here on the enterprise id feel much more secure\nthank you lieutenant mauri c\nprobably not simply securing the area\nim sure your e right yes this will do very nicely\ntheres no need well take care of everything thank you lieutenant\nis there a problem commander\nim sorry but perhaps this will brighten your spirits we have freed your captain and doctor\nthey were being held in prison just outside the pry tt capital one of our operatives was able to arrange their escape\nwell they should be en route to the kes border our operative provided them with a detailed map and instructions on where to go\nat the moment that information is confidential but trust us we do have a plan\ni understand your concern of course but i would feel more comfortable discussing these operational details in a less public environment\ni would prefer the quarters you provided me theyre safer\njust a few pieces of equipment necessary for security reasons you understand\nyou must realise that everything im about to say can not leave this room for some time we have had certain friends among the pry tt citizens who realise that the long struggle between our two peoples can only end when the pry tt government is made to see reason\nthats a crude but accurate term these friends will be waiting for your captain and doctor when they reach the village of oh nk or near the kes border the map we provided your officers will take them to a tavern there\nthe danger is minimal our operatives control almost the whole village once contact has been made with captain picard and doctor crusher our friends will escort them across the border into kes\ncommander i assure you we know what were doing weve had a great deal of experience dealing with the pry tt wed hardly risk the safety of your people after all we still hope you will recommend our entrance into the federation\nhave a seat captain picard and doctor crusher didnt show up at the designated rendezvous point\nno we have no idea what happened to them we find it strange that your officers should follow the escape plan so precisely and then fail to make the crucial rendezvous with our operatives\nour sources would have informed us instantly if that had happened of course if they were nt captured if they simply made a different rendezvous we might not ever know about it\nof course not how could you know if your captain and doctor were meeting secretly with the pry tt meeting in order to set up a military alliance with the federation\nit was a clever scheme first you pretend to lose your officers during transport then you ask us for help and get us to expose several of our undercover operatives in the process but what you didnt expect was for us to get your people out of prison so quickly they needed more time they needed more time to plot the destruction of the kes with their new pry tt friends\nindeed why\nthen i believe its time for us to be leaving the enterprise\ncommander\ncommander your e working with the pry tt putting on this little show for my benefit does neither of us any good\ndont pretend the two of you are enemies its too late for charades\nno more than i would sit with her\nas if you dont already know\nthat is an interesting but pointless lie id rather discuss your own plans to use federation aid to stage a takeover of kol rod island\nyou have no authority to make that decision despite whatever games you played with the pry tt when you arrived we still plan to take our petition directly to the federation council theyll listen\nno im really sorry i dont\nyou have im really sorry\nnot worried exactly this notion of admitting half of their planet to the federation while leaving the other half out\nevery member of the federation entered as a unified world and that unity said something about them that they had resolved certain social and political differences and they were now ready to become part a larger community\nbut the pry tt are not they are reclusive to the point of xenophobia\nthat analogy is not exactly\ngo ahead number one\ninform him were on our way thankyou for breakfast\nlets not keep them waiting mister worf\nenergise\nbeverly beverly\ni dont know\ni would assume we must be on ke spry tt were in some kind of prison cell the question is why i cant imagine that ambassador mauri c would have any reason to detain us\nwhat is it\nwhat\nsome kind of coercive device\nwhat is going on here\nprisoners on whose authority\nenemy you mean thekes\nyour information is incorrect we have no plans to enter into any\nand then youll discover that were telling the truth\nwhat\nyour e staring at me\nthere may be a structural flaw that would allow us to escape\nbeverly the important thing during any confinement is to think positively and not give up hope there is a way out of every box there is a solution to every puzzle its just a matter of finding it\ndamn\nit means they plan on keeping us here for awhile\ndoes it work\nits a map\npossibly or it could be part of a very carefully laid trap\nagreed is there a way to open the cell door\nthere must be a lava flow or a underground hot spring somewhere near here\ncan we get through it\nwhat did you say\nsay when\nthe eruptions have stopped\ntheres no way out of here\nwhat\ni didnt say anything about being thirsty\ni was thinking about it but i didnt say anything\nthe transceivers lorin said that they would align themselves to our psi wave patterns\ni dont know\nwell right now we have more immediate concerns does your maps how usa way out of here\nright\ni heard that they were not words exactly a sudden sense of fear a sense of fear of heights\nit was a strange sensation suddenly having these thoughts appear in my mind\ncome on youve done this before its just like on a holodeck one step at a time just climbing steadily and slowly\none of us is hungry\ndo you mind thinking of something else your e making me hungry\nsomething other than a large bowl of vegetable soup\nbeverly\ni am not being unreasonable\nyour e right we cant react to every random thought that crosses the other persons mind isnt astonishing though how much clutter there is in a consciousness odd memories coming to the surface bits of half remembered songs\ni just wanted to see if you were still listening\nmaybe if we put some distance between us that might weaken it not that im growing tired of hearing your most intimate thoughts\nwhat happened\nme too\nthe same thing but when you moved back toward me it got better well it seems as if were stuck with each other\nwhat is it\nlet me see this way\nwhat\nno but there are times when it is necessary for a captain to give the appearance of confidence\nim beginning to realise that you seem to always have some acerbic remark on the tip of your tongue\nyour friends there was someone called tom norris\ntheres something more youre laughing but actually your e embarrassed by that incident\nthis sharing of thoughts and feelings is quite compelling\nno its several kilometres to find another way around that ridge the border is just two kilometres east of here theresa force field protecting it but we can find some way to deal with that when we get there come on\nno luck\nwell by this time tomorrow we could be back on the enterprise and you can plant yourself in front of a replicator with a knife and fork\nthats not true\nthats not quite what i meant\nits just that i dont like\nyou see i think that breakfast should be a simple meal and recently you ve been ordering these elaborate things\ni didnt think it was important you dont like those elaborate meals either\ntheres something about the flame the smell of the smoke its always seemed to me to be intoxicating somehow\ndidnt you\nyou were married to my best friend at first i thought it was harmless infatuation something hormonal rather than emotional\ni realised that it was something else and it wasnt right but although i would never act on it i couldnt help the way i felt\ni felt guilty before he died having feelings like that for my best friends wife and then later after the accident i promised myself that i would never tell you know how i felt it would be like betraying my friend\ni didnt know how i would react and then little by little i realised that i didnt have those feelings anymore twenty years is after all along time\nyes friends\nright\nim all right\nnono the modulation frequency is in the upper harmonic range\ntheyre coming\ni tend to agree number one\nof course of course your e absolutely right\nmy pleasure\nso were you getting tired of my company\nto freedom\ni was just thinking that as distracting as it was i was beginning to get used to hearing your thoughts and i find that i miss it\noh\na man cant be held responsible for what his mind does while he s asleep\nso now that weve had this unique experience what do we do\nyou know exactly what i mean\nnow that we know how each of us feels perhaps we should not be afraid to explore those feelings\ngoodnight back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc copyright 1966 present

unauthorised communication this transmission is terminated\nriker to captain\nweve received word from ambassador mau riches ready to see you and doctor crusher\nthen what happened to the captain and doctor crusher\nis there a way to locate those coordinates\ni dont know and its not going to be easy to find out the pry tt have consistently refused all outside contact were going to have to work through the kes contact ambassador mauri c tell him i want a meeting right now\nthats very kind ambassador but i dont think anyone here holds you or thekes government responsible for whats happened\nambassador we have not even attempted a diplomatic effort yeti would rather not use force until weve exhausted all other options\nwith all due respect ambassador i think i should try to communicate with the pry tt before i sanction the use of force\nagreed\nmister worf will help you\ncan you determine which of the comm links is connected to the prime ministers office\nwell theyre going to have to adjust open a channel\nthis is commander william trike r federation starship enterprise i know this may seem an unusual way\nthats right\nwere having trouble contacting your government directly we had to start somewhere if you would let me talk to your\nas is aid were having trouble contacting you\nnot very friendly are they\nwell it looks like we got someones attention on screen\nminister we ve been attempting to contact someone in your government it appears that you have detained two of our officers we would like to discuss the situation\njust the same lets keep the shields up for the time being\nour efforts with the pry tt just ran into a wall\nwhat\nhow will you get them across the border\nambassador im afraid i must insist that you provide us with more information\ncertainly we can step into the ready room\nall right\ni see youve done some redecorating\ncertainly\nhow do you plan to get our people out of pry tt territory\nyouve recruited a few pry tt spies\nforgive me ambassador but is it wise to send two human fugitives in starfleet uniforms into a pry tt village\ni would still feel better if they could rendezvous with your operatives in a less public place\nis something wrong\ndo you know what happened to them\na different rendezvous im not sure i know what you mean\nwhat\nthis is ridiculous your e beginning to see conspiracies everywhere we were invited hereby thekes why would we all yourselves with the pry tt\nyou can believe what you like were going to find our people with or without your help\nfine make sure you take all this junk with you\nambassador thankyou for coming\nwere going to clear up this misunderstanding once and for all hail minister lorin please\nyes i know but i think its about time we all sat down together and tried to work this out i have ambassador mauri c here\nwell see mister worf\ni believe there s someone waiting for us in the observation lounge\nim sorry to resort to such drastic measures minister but you left me little choice\nlets all just sit down and try to talk about whats happened to captain picard and doctor crusher\nall right then well stand the important thing is that we start talking\nall right then you talk to me where are my officers\nthat siti can see that diplomacy is not going to get us anywhere today and i do not have time for to negotiate so lets put all of our cards on the table your e concerned thekes are going to be admitted to the federation\nas first officer of the enterprise i think i can promise you thats not going to happen thekes will be denied membership\nthey will also listen to the reports of the captain of the enterprise and his first officer and i can tell you right now the first officers report will go something like this ke spry tt a deeply troubled world with social political and military problems they have yet to resolve the kes while a friendly and democratic people are driven by suspicion deviousness and paranoia it is the opinion of this officer they are not ready for membership now the matter of our missing officers\nthen maybe you should consider this if anything happens to them starfleet is going to want a full investigation which means more starships will be coming toke spry tt and those ships are going to want answers which puts your country under a very large and very uncomfortable microscope remember how unhappy you were when we contacted just one of your people without authorisation well just think of what it ll be like ten starships asking questions contacting hundreds of your people massive sensor sweeps they may even start sending down away teams all because you wouldnt help me find my missing officers\nthank you minister now if you ll excuse me\nm auric is determined to take his protest to the federation council but i dont think hell get very far\ndid i miss something\nour primary concern is not to assign blame but to recover our missing officers\nsurely you must have some means of communication in case of a planetary emergency\nhow long has it been since your last diplomatic contact\nthen its possible they may have changed over the years\nminister we have the human female the male is standing in kes territory\nunderstood\ncaptain doctor i have the coordinates of ambassador mauri cs chambers\nenterprise tokes security relay station one were ready to commence transport\nconfirmed\nthis is the enterprise we have completed the transport sequence you should have them\ncommander the transporter sensor log shows an unusual concentration of anti graviton particles in the emitter coil\nwhy does the pry tt want captain picard and doctor crusher\naye sir\nwe can determine their communications frequencies and establish a link\nis there a problem ambassador\ni can assure you there is no need\nas security chief of the enterprise i would be glad to assist you in any way possible\nsir we are being hailed it is the pry tt security council\ntheir weapon systems pose no threat to the enterprise\naye sir\nwhere are they now\nit is possible they have been recaptured\naye sir",
    "episode 159": "levels are unchanged\npower conversion levels are at ninety seven point two percent\nthe fleming was carrying a supply of rare biomimetic gel which is very valuable is it possible that the ferengi might have hijacked it\nputting limits on warp speed is only going to prevent other rifts from forming what are we going to do about this one\ngeordi\nwhy is spot under the bed\nhas spot been misbehaving\nthese incidents are common to cat owners when you borrowed spot you said you wanted to experience the full range of feline behaviour before getting a cat yourself\nspot does not respond to verbal commands\ni never found it to be necessary\ni have never experienced this kind of behaviour in spot although she does have the unfortunate habit of jumping on my computer console when i am working\ni do not think it would be wise to startle her\nthe unusually intense te tryon fields in this sector pose a severe navigational hazard to warp driven vessels the he karas corridor is the only route through the area which is free of te tryon fields ships travelling at warp must use the corridor to ensure safe passage through the region\nat least two days sir the corridor is over twelve light years long and the surrounding te tryon interference will limit our sensor range\ngeordi there has been a slight drop in sensor efficiency perhaps we should examine the phase buffers\nis there a problem with the engines\nthen why are you stabilizing the conduit\nbut that would not affect the engines in any way\nwhat is the point\nwhy\nyes\ni understand you are in competition with mister kaplan\nthen you are trying to outperform the intrepid\none moment the phase buffer is functioning within normal parameters sensor efficiency has increased by six points even percent\ngeordi i have taken your suggestion regarding spot\ni have begun training her\nyes i am studying several new techniques\ni began with simple conditioned response exercises and followed with environmental enhancement next i plan to explore bio conditioning devices\nsuch as sensor nets for behaviour modification or biofeedback motivators unfortunately i have been less than successful\ngeordi i can not stun my cat\nclearly there is a misalignment somewhere in this system\ni am somewhat concerned that my training efforts will ultimately fail\ni have consulted numerous animal training manuals some of them claim that cats are inherently un trainable\nwhat did she train her cat to do\ninteresting perhaps i could modify your sisters techniques to keep spot from jumping on console do you know how she was able to train her cat\nphase alignment is stabilised however sensor efficiency has increased by only an additional one point three percent\ndata here\nacknowledged sir we are on our way\nthat is correct sir their impulse system is down as well power generation is at extremely low levels\nlife support systems are also functioning at low levels there are approximately four hundred fifty ferengi on board that is a standard complement for a ship of that class\nit would also explain the failure of their warp drive\ndirect hit their weapon systems are down\nsir the ferengi ships power has stabilised they appear to have impulse capability\nspot spot spot down spot down down spot down this is down down is good this is up up is no\none moment come in\ni would be happy to\nit is part of her training programme i am teaching spot to jump down from the desk on my command\ni have not been entirely successful\nfeline supplement number two twenty one\ni suppose i must accept that possibility it may be that spot lacks the intelligence necessary to learn the appropriate responses to my commands\nthis procedure will only increase the conversion level by point eight percent\nenough\nlaforge i got the intrepids power conversion levels up to ninety seven point one percent maybe you should try cleaning your plasma grid once in a while\nwe perform maintenance on the plasma grid at regular intervals\nunknown sir it does not appear in any federation charts of the corridor\nit is a possibility the debris consists primarily of d uranium and poly composite fragments which suggest a ship furthermore the field contains sufficient mass to account for the fleming\ncaptain i am picking up a small metallic object approximately three point five metres in diameter\ni do not believe so it is emitting an unusual signal captain it is beginning to generate a verter on field\nunidentified ship heading toward us two life forms are aboard\ncaptain they are initiating their transporter system\ncaptain we are being boarded\nserov a andra bal believe there are regions of potential subspace instability within the corridor they believe that if these regions continue to be exposed to warp field energy they will rupture subspace will extrude into normal space forming a rift\nthat analogy is essentially correct sir\nnot at this time sir there is insufficient evidence to do so in order to determine whether or not a rift will form region must be exposed to warp field energy approximately one million times greater than that normally generated by a starship\ni agree that is a possibility captain i suggest we ask the federation science council to send a research vessel to this area a more detailed investigation would resolve many of our questions\ncaptain the he karan ships engines are beginning to overload i believe serov as attempting to create a warp core breach\nwe have cleared the shockwave however te tryon flux in the area is increasing rapidly\nthe event is approximately zero point one light years in diameter and it is emitting extremely high levels of te tryon radiation it appears to be what raba land serov a predicted a subspace rift\nscanning the fleming is near its previous coordinates it appears to be intact but it is now within the rift\nif we maintain our current position our shields should provide sufficient protection\nthe waves are even more intense within the rift i estimate her shields will fail in approximately twelve hours\ndoctor is it possible there are areas inside the rift which are stable where we can safely use our warp engines\nthat should not be possible\ni am not certain that is true i believe i have an idea\ni suggest we coast into the rift\nwe can initiate a brief high intensity warp pulse from our current position we should be able to attain sufficient velocity to enter the rift beam the crew off the fleming and exit without using our warp engines\nif we field saturate the nacelles we should be able to sustain warp speed for approximately two minutes\nthe timing will be critical\naye sir\ni believe the maximum saturation level should be eighteen point three percent\ni agree but based on the size of the rift it should give us sufficient time to complete the rescue computer initiate nacelle field saturation\ni beg your pardon\ntechnically geordi we were not wrong serov as theories rested on assumptions which were unprovable\nby using methods any reputable scientist would never employ\nwe reviewed serov as research to the best of our abilities and we were prepared to continue studying the problem but that was not satisfactory\ni do not believe that you would have resorted to such extremes\nperhaps because her aggressive methods created an adversarial situation\ni do not understand\ncaptain warp pulse calculations are complete we will be firing the engines at maximum intensity for six point three seconds before disengaging\nengines disengaged we are now entering the rift hull stress is increasing eighty three percent of maximum tolerance and rising\ncaptain if they activate\nthey are badly damaged sir their life support systems are failing\ncaptain when the fleming activated their warp drive the rift expanded by two point three percent we no longer have sufficient momentum to escape\ndistortion wave intensity has increased by a factor often\ndistortion waves occurring every fifty nine seconds hull stress is nearing maximum tolerance\ni do not believe so sir and the resulting explosion would likely destroy the saucer section in the process\nthe next distortion wave will impact in fourteen seconds\nten seconds\nwe were unable to maintain phase match with the distortion wave sir\nanother distortion wave approaching impact in twenty six seconds\ncaptain i suggest we take the ship to full impulse if we can attain sufficient speed it will lessen the shock when the wave hits\ndistortion wave impact in five seconds\nwe are now within the distortion wave hull stresses have exceeded maximum tolerance\napproximately twelve seconds sir hull stresses one hundred twenty percent above tolerance\nwe have cleared the rift sir hull stress has returned to normal\naye sir\nim just trying to get a slightly higher power conversion level\nthis procedure will only increase the conversion level by point eight percent\ni do not believe so sir and the resulting explosion would likely destroy the saucer section in the process\naye sir\naye sir\naye sir\nin here data\ngot her now she strapped come on out of there you hey dont you spit at me\nprobably because she knows if i catch her im going to kill her\nso far shes broken a vase a teapot shes ruined one of my chairs using it as a scratch post and shes coughing hairballs up all over my carpet\nyeah well im not ready you can take her back with my blessings go ahead call her\nshe wont come when you call her data have you ever considered training this cat\nnecessary data the cat is out of control half the time i wasnt sure if she was going to lick me or scratch my face off\nshe needs training\nright we have together out of here ills care her you grab her when she comes out okay\nready ow\ntraining definitely captains log stardate 473102 were investigating the disappearance of the medical transport fleming somewhere in the he karas corridor our search is complicated by the unique properties of this particular region of space\nthey wont be very effective the interference will make it difficult to maintain contact with the probes the best we can do is to increase sensor efficiency weve installed multiphase buffers on all the sensor modules captain it should help a little\nno problem data ill be right with you okay hansen transfer conduit thirteen to the stabiliser matrix\nno\nim just trying to get a slightly higher power conversion level\ni know that data its not the point\nim just trying to get a higher conversion level thats all\nyou know the intrepid\nwell their chief engineer is commander donald kaplan he and i went through the academy together i just like to make sure that our power conversion levels are a little higher than their s\nyou might say that this is the flagship we should be better than everybody else\nactually its more a point of personal pride these are my engines and theres nothing wrong with a little friendly rivalry okay computer how much have the conversion levels increased\nall right ill deal with of this later let me give you a hand with those sensors\nhows that\nsix points even one of the stages must still be out of alignment lets try junction a nine\ncoming down\nreally\ndevices\nive got an idea how about a phaser a low stun setting at just the right moment might do the trick\ni was kidding data lets see what we ve got no this isnt it either\nthats for sure well we ve got one more possibility junction c twelve\nmay be your e just going about it the wrong way data\ni dont believe that for a second listen to me my sister didnt know a thing about animals and she was able to train her cat how complicated could it be\nshe had that cat jumping into her arms on command\nwell as i recall she walked around for two months with a piece of tuna in her blouse\ni was right this buffer is out of alignment okay try that\nits not much but every little bit going to help\nwere not going to squeeze anything else out of these systems\ncaptain there are no emissions from their plasma vents their warp drive must be completely inactive\nim not picking any subspace emissions from the ship at all captain it looks like everyone of their field coils has been overloaded\ncaptain ferengi sensors are still online i could modify one of our deflector emitters to transmit old style delta waves if i modulate that with a comm signal the ferengi should be able to pick that up\nalmost ready captain all right lets give it a try\ndata i had another idea that might help boost the power conversion levels could you give me a hand\ndont tell me your e trying to teach the cat to use the console\nhow sit going\ndata that cat definitely has a mind of her own may be shes just not trainable\ni dont know about spot but it seems to me your training is coming along just fine come on lets go\ndata keep the flow constant will you while ire modulate the power taps\ni know but it could be just enough\ni just received this from commander kaplan subspace\ncan you believe the nerve of that guy\ni know he s just trying to get me angry there that should do it computer what are the current power conversion levels\ntoo bad mister kaplan captains log supplemental we have traced the flemings most likely course it now appears that the vessel may have come to an unfortunate end\nlaforge to bridge\nwe have intruders in main engineering i need a security team down here immediately\nwhat do you want\ncaptain ive heard this theory before their research was evaluated by the federation science council a few years ago quite frankly it didnt hold up\ntheir verter on pulse overloaded our field coils captain itll take at least thirty six hours to get underway\nyes sir\nyou know even when we get the engines online its going to take at least a week to recalibrate them properly\nwhat if the fleming had been transporting perishable supplies or was on an emergency mission your little plan might have cost a lot of lives\nyeah well you have a very interesting way of going about it\nid have to agree with that\nwarp drive has been around for three centuries its a proven technology\nyou mean you didnt believe her either\nwell our commander data sno slouch if there s anything there hell find it\nhe karas two is the only inhabited world in this region without warp drive youd be completely isolated from the rest of the federation are you really willing to take that step\ncaptain the engines are back online all systems are ready\nshe was right\nsome kind of high energy distortion wave looks like they re being generated from within the rift\nnot at warp commander according to these readings the rift is in a state of accelerating instability which would make it extremely sensitive to warp field energy if we go in at warp we might make it expand even further\neverything here supports serov as theories i cant find any way to close the rift or even reduce its size\nwait a minute this is strange computer display grid delta seventeen enhance and magnify what do you make of that\nin the meantime wed better tell the captain we dont know how to get to the fleming\nall right with these parameters we should be able to maintain warp speed for two minutes eight seconds i dont think we can get any more than that\nhow did we miss it data\nhow did we miss the connection between warp drive and the formation of the rift between the two of us weve logged thousands of hours on these engines were supposed to be warp field experts we certainly were wrong this time\nseems to me she managed to prove them pretty conclusively\nyeah she was willing to die to make her point we should have listened to her more closely data\nyeah i can remember times when i was a little stubborn trying to get people to believe me when i didnt have enough proof\nbut she had to just to get us to listen why was iso resistant\nyeah may be i was taking the whole thing personally\nmay be i was a little threatened the thought that warp engines might be doing some kind of damage its going to take another half an hour for the nacelles to saturate will you call me when they redone\nmay i join you\ni wanted to say im sorry about your sister\ni wish it could have happened differently may be i should have looked at the research more closely its possible theres something that i missed\nno i guess the question is now where do we go from here\nive been in starfleet for a long time we depend on warp drive i just dont know how easy its going to be to change\naye sir\ninitiating warp pulse now\ncaptain\nwe might be able to get out of here without using the warp engines\nwhen was the last time you went surfing commander\nexactly captain if can phase match our deflector shield laforge\nyes sir phase matching the deflectors shield now\nmatching phases prepare to engage the deflector shield on my mark\nand mark\nwe lost it\nthe speed differential was too high captain\nwere ready captain\nwere separating from the distortion wave im attempting to compensate\nour scans have shown a lot of subspace instabilities throughout the sector if they re exposed to enough warp energies they could eventually create other rifts\nunfortunately right now theres not much we can do\nwe should have those thermal stabilisers ready for the he karan sin another day

realise its in their own interests and take similar action\nthe federation is setting up a weather control matrix on he karas two its only a temporary solution but it should suffice for now\nif there are no more questions your e all dismissed\nvery well you know geordi i spent the better part of my life exploring space ive charted new world sive met dozens of new species and i believe that these were all valuable ends in themselves now it seems that all this while i was helping to damage the thing that i hold most dear\nour attack we were defending ourselves do you deny that you are responsible for disabling my vessel\nyou were attempting to move in for the kill do not toy with me picard we are obviously at your mercy but know this when the ferengi council learns of your actions they will consider this an act of war\ni see no reason to trust you human\nperhaps it would be better to discuss the situation\nwe detected what appeared to be a federation signal buoy when we approach edit it emitted a massive verter on pulse our warp drive our sensors our communications systems were all disabled we assumed we were the victims of a new federation weapon\nwe passed a federation ship several days ago it did not appear to be in any distress\nit is possible that information was recorded in our sensor logs commander unfortunately my entire crew is occupied with our repairs i dont think there will be time to search our records\ni believe it would captain\nwere trying to make you listen\ncaptain according to our research warp fields cause a dangerous reaction in this region of space\nif something isnt done our planet will become uninhabitable\ntheir resources are limited it would have taken over a year before they dispatched a science ship to come and evaluate our work\nwe dispersed verter on probes in the corridor merely to disable warp driven ships nothing more\nmy sister and i do not wish to impede your rescue process\nserov a we will do as you ask captain but please reexamine our data\ncommander i know my sister can be somewhat er aggravating\nbut please try to understand she believes profoundly in this cause she has sworn to dedicate her life to exposing the dangers of warp drive\nand you sound just like i did about four years ago\nno what i didnt realise was just how brilliant my sister is it took two years of study for me even to grasp the principles behind her theoretical models theyre that sophisticated\nwell i hope so because once we persuade starfleet to stop warp travel through the corridor were going to have to convince our own people to give up warp drive completely\nyes and if you were in my position i hope you d be willing to do the same thing\ncommander we believe the warp field effect is cumulative each starship that passes through the corridor at warp brings us one step closer to forming a rift\ncaptain i appreciate the opportunity your e giving us its a beginning that we need\ni dont know captain may i speak to her\nsero va what are you trying to do\nno\nof course captain\ni dont know\nperhaps computers can the rift for regions of low instability\ntheres no areas table enough to withstand a warp pulse\nits a subspace instability outside the rift\ncommander im going to begin a field enhanced scan of this sector id like to take a closer look at this\ncommander\nthank you im trying to tell myself that she died for what she believed in but somehow that isnt much comfort\nno you didnt miss anything the problem was time we needed more time to do the proper research serov a wasnt willing to wait\ni dont think we can look at space travel the same way anymore were going to have to change\nit wont be easy at all\nbased on current warp drive patterns in the sector weve projected where

with starfleet was four days ago according to them there was nothing out of the ordinary when they entered the corridor\nthey have n tive already spoken to the he karan government according to them only one ship has passed through the system in the last week it was a ferengi trader\ni wouldnt put it past them i think we should prepare for that contingency\nriker to data\nwere picking up a ship ahead on long range sensors if you and geordi are through down there wed like to have you on the bridge\nthats the same ferengi vessel that entered the corridor a week ago\nthat would explain why they havent respond to our hails\nif they did hijack the fleming they sure didnt get very far with the cargo\nready phasers prepare to return fire\nthey were just playing dead conserving power until we got in close enough\nsomehow i dont think they ll let us beam over there and ask them\nwhatever happened to your ship may not have been an isolated incident a federation medical transport was recently lost in that corridor\ncan you give us an idea of its heading\ncould be a ships log recorder or a probe casing\njust like the ferengi ship\nall decks security alert\nthat show you rationalise these attacks\nyou can call it whatever you like the fact remains you deliberately disguised your probes you made them look like signal markers you hid them in debris field you mined the corridor\nbridge to captain picard\nweve located the\nfleming on long range sensors approximately zero point three light years away\nthe vessel appears to be intact they have shields but it looks like their subspace

procedures\ndata what if we forced an discharge through the impulse reactor would that be enough to get us out of here\nhow geordi\nwe could ride it through the rift and then breakaway once were clear that is if we survive the ride\nour hull stress is already critical we cant handle many more jolts like that\nwere lucky the rift took place as far away from the planet as it did it gives us some time to consider our options\nyour e killing us\nour planet is already being affected we have measured large gravitational shifts throughout our system\nthat research was only preliminary our original analysis was incomplete\nwe were not willing to wait any longer we knew that if we disabled enough ships starfleet would come then at least we would be able to present our case\nneither you nor the ferengi suffered any casualties commander the actual damage to your vessels was negligible\ni know precisely how our pulse affected your field coils with my help your ship could be operational in ten hours provided you agree to review our research\nrab al dont the probes are the only leverage we have if we\nthere shields have been restored you will be able to re engage your engines in approximately eight hours\nim sorry you ve been inconvenienced but thats all it is an inconvenience our concerns are much more important than the condition of your engines\nthat didnt happen commander

have expected anything different\nnot we you can do whatever you want ra bali ll have no part of this its just another delay\nthey wanted proof im going to give it to them im sorry\nhe karas two is

wonderful let me show you what we do newcomers find this\nwhat were doing is so exciting so inspiring we take a lifeless planet and little by little transform it into an m class environment capable of supporting life terraforming makes you feel a little god like the first phase involves selecting the planet thats very important it must have the right mass and gravity the correct rate of rotation and a balanced day and night the planet must also be without life or the prospect of life developing naturally the federation determines if thats so then we take over this station is phase two phase three involves water usually we create basins using hydraulic landscaping but the water on this planet is subsurface and extremely high in salt content we are just about to begin pumping and filtering

without a good reason\nall right data at first glance i see nothing wrong with her except for a mild case of hypertension which is normal for a woman her age\nmaybe you should tell me what her symptoms are\nthen why do you want to see her medical records\nshes got tear ducts sweat glands even veins and capillaries underneath her skin\nbecause she has a feedback processor designed to send out a false bio signal\nwhat i cant figure out is why she lost consciousness as far as i can see everything is fine she should be awake\nwhy was doctor soong so adamant that she not be told\nwouldnt she be better off knowing the truth dealing with the reality of her existence\ni can tell you that if i were in her place i would rather be told by my son than by some stranger\nthe only permanent solution would be to re liquefy the core\nthe procedure will involve using the ships phasers to drill down through the planets surface into the pockets where we would set up a series of plasma infusion units\nit should be possible to stabilise the core temperature at ninety three percent of normal\nyes doctor\nyou are doctor juliana tainer\nhave we met before\nyou were a colleague of doctor

i discovered that my memory banks contained the contents of their journals and logs\nmy childhood\nso you wiped my memory processors after this childhood\ndoctor i have scanned the journals of the colonists there is only one juliana mentioned in them her last name was odonnell\nbut there was no mention that my father was married to you\nmy father did have an unusual way of looking at things\ni encountered him once in the ter lina system\nit was shortly before his death\nyes\nwhat do you mean\nthis has been an interesting encounter and an altogether unexpected one i would like to corroborate your story before we proceed further excuse me doctor\ninform me when you are ready\ni am attempting to ascertain whether doctor tainers story is true\nin either believe nor doubt i am simply attempting to verify her assertions\nthe registrars office on mavala four can not confirm whether doctor soong was married there apparently many of the documents were lost when the government was overthrown\ni am checking passenger manifests to see if they went to mavala during the period in question odonnell juliana soong noon ian they were both passengers on a transport which travelled from omicron theta to mavala and returned four days later\nstill the fact that they went to mavala does not prove they were married there\nnot at all i am merely unable to reconcile her story with the fact that my father never mentioned her to me\nyes it is possible that those are memories of my childhood and of mrs soong\ni can think of no motive for such a pretense\nthat is true\ni admit i am finding it difficult to accept the possibility of a past about which i know nothing but it is also true that i am curious to learn more about it\ni would like to get to know you better mother\nhow did you decide\nyes\npleased\nyou misunderstand counsellor troi is a therapist\nwe will be in position over the drilling site in three minutes twentynine seconds\nthese scans indicate that the magma pockets where we plan to set up the infusion units are somewhat unstable\nthank you geordi\ni am incapable of embarrassment please continue\nmy calculations indicate\nthe first phaser blast will be approximately nineteen seconds in duration\nwe are within two kilometres of the magma pocket\ni detect no increase in the stress levels of the surrounding magma\nthe drilling process has raised the temperature in the magma pockets by almost three hundred degrees celsius it will be several hours before it cools enough for us to enter\ni do not\nthankyou i will be playing this piece at a recital tomorrow evening\ni have been told that my playing is technically flawless but no one has described it as beautiful\nare you certain you are not saying this because you are my mother i have noticed that parents tend to exaggerate when it comes to their childrens accomplishments\ni do not know for certain but i believe it is during my creative endeavours that i come closest to experiencing what it must be like to be human\nasami\ni would like that very much\ni could replicate one for you computer please replicate one viola\nyes i am attempting to master all known styles of painting this one is in the style of the early french impressionists\nthat is lal my daughter\ni created her using myself as a model\nthe positronic matrix i designed for her was unstable she only lived a short time\nin a sense you were her grandmother would you like to practice now\nthe acoustics in ten forward are most favourable\nof course\nperhaps i created lal because i wished to procreate despite what happened to her i still have that wish\ni was not aware he created other androids before my brother\niam that android are you saying you were against my creation\nthen why did you never attempt to contact me\nperhaps if you told me what has made you feel this way it may alleviated the guilt\nwe are within four kilometres of the magma pocket\nif we do we will have to begin a new shaft at a suitable location\ni am detecting no signs of\ninstability\nacknowledged\ni have initialised the plasma induction coils\ni am incapable of anger\ni am not certain i do perhaps you could clarify them for me\nif i had been your biological offspring would you have left me on omicron theta\ndoctor tainer i get the impression you are trying to spare my feelings i assure you that is not necessary\nis that because you place more value on biological life than on artificial life\ni do thankyou for making it clear to me\ni was hoping you would be able to determine that from her transporter trace pattern\ndoctor i would ask that you not require me to be more specific i assure you i have a good reason for asking\ni see\nshe has not complained of any discomfort\nbecause i have reason to believe she is not who she claims to be\ngo ahead sir\non my way excuse me doctor\nacknowledged\nthere will be more seismic activity we must hurry\nthe shaft has not been obstructed by the seismic activity it should be possible to trigger the unit from orbit\npriming the energy transfer matrix\ngo ahead sir\nunderstood sir we will attempt to expedite our work\nyes sir well be returning to the beam out point shortly\nno we are too far below the surface\nthere are no handholds in the rockface we are going to have to jump\nyou will\ncheck her positronic matrix there may be a cascade anomaly\nthe first indication occurred when we were digging i saw her perform complex calculations without the assistance of the computer\nthat is true but it was enough to get my attention later i noticed something odd about the way she blinked her eyes the intervals between blinks were governed by the fourier system the same mathematical formula my father used to give my blinking pattern the appearance of randomness\nthen there was the concert in ten forward\nwe had practised the piece and i noticed that she played it the same way during the performance every pitch every intonation was exactly the same only an artificial life form could have done that\ni do not believe so he is on the surface monitoring the plasma infusion\nit appears to be an information module with a holographic interface\nthat is correct\ni am data\ni am fine\nyou refer to doctor tainer as my mother yet the complexity of her design indicates she was created after i was\nwhat happened to her\nthen you never told her the truth\nwhat happened\nif she recovers and learns that she is an android\nthen you do not believe she should know the truth\nit seems that i must make a decision whether to tell doctor tainer that she is an android or to withhold that information from her i do not know what to do\nhe seemed certain that if she knew it would preclude the possibility of her being happy\ni am not certain i understand why my father felt as he did but his wishes are not necessarily paramount i am more concerned with what would be best for her\ni find i am having difficulty separating what would be best for her from what would be best for me\nif she knew she were an android we would have something to share i would no longer be alone in the universe\nyou were knocked unconscious by the fall you broke a bone in your arm but doctor crusher repaired it everything is fine captains log supplemental the infusion of plasma into the core of a trea four has been accomplished the core should remain molten for several hundred years\nperhaps i can visit at rea on my next leave\nthere is something i thought you should know my father told me that he had only one great love in his life and that he regretted never telling her how much he cared for her i am certain he was referring to you\ngoodbye mother energise back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc copyright 1966

husband and i first contacted you the molten core of our planet is not just cooling its begun to solidify\nif the cooling continues at this rate at rea will become uninhabitable in thirteen months\na few kilometres why\ni see injecting sufficient plasma directly into the core should trigger a chain reaction and that will re liquify the magma\ndo you have any idea who i am\nyou lost all your early memories we thought you would but we couldnt be certain\noh data i was there right at the beginning on omicron the tai helped create you now look at you\nyes i certainly was and i was also his wife in away i suppose you could say i am your mother\ni still cant believe im seeing you like this again after all these years\noh theresa reason for that we wiped your processors after we finished refining your programming why dont you tell me what you do remember and then ill fill in the gaps\nafter the attack of the crystalline entity\nwe hoped their experiences would be useful after your childhood we figured you could use all the help you could get\nthats what i called it you were like a baby at first a hundred kilogram baby but still you had trouble learning your motor skills learning how to process sensory information and of course noon ian was never satisfied he kept tinkering trying to make you as human as possible\nthen we deactivated you and programmed you with the colonists logs we had planned to reactivate you but we never got the chance thats when the crystalline entity attacked we had to leave quickly we wanted to take you with us but there was only room for two in the escape pod\nthat sme\nbecause of my mother she thought that noon ian was an eccentric scientist who was too old for me we decided to marry secretly to give her a chance to get used to our being together we slipped a way to mavala four and got married there a klingon and a co rv allan trader were our witnesses it wasnt exactly the wedding id hoped for somehow noon ian had a way of making even the oddest things seem romantic\nhow would you know that\nthats where we went to after we left the outpost i had no idea that you d even met him\nhes dead\ni had no idea it would hit me this hard we didnt exactly part on the best of terms\ni realised he loved his work as much as he loved me may be more there we were stuck on this planet in the middle of the jungle with no one else to talk to no life it just wasnt enough thats why i left that was all a very very long time ago the important thing is that were here now together and i do want to get to know you\ndata\ni wanted to make you female but your father insisted on a son we argued about it endlessly right up until we were ready to assemble you\nnoon ian walked in with your head in his hand and innocent as you please said it was up to me he knew perfectly well what he was doing once again he had made it in his own image what could i possibly say deanna troi is that who youre going to visit\nyour father would be so pleased\nhe was worried that the sexuality programme he designed for you wouldnt work\ngoodnight\nim going to monitor the density of the rock layers and adjust the strength of the particle beam as we go that should minimise the seismic stress that we generate while were drilling\nim just so pleased you ve got good manners it wasnt easy to strike the right balance with your programming at first you couldnt have cared less about the social niceties like please and thankyou you were downright rude in fact\nthat was nothing to the problems we encountered never mind i dont want to embarrass you\nwell the one thing we couldnt anticipate was that you didnt seem to mind about being naked some of the colonists objected to having an anatomically correct android running around without any clothes on we asked you to dress but you didnt feel it was necessary because you didnt suffer from the elements we actually had to write a modesty subroutine to get you to keep your clothes on\nanother five seconds should do it weve broken through\nthe pocket seems stable\nwe have data to thank for that i couldnt have done it without him his figures were perfect\ndata do you have any plans right now\nmaybe we should spend a little time together id love to see your quarters\nthat was beautiful\nit was really\ni suppose theres a certain amount of vanity involved considering that giving you a creative aspect was my idea your father didnt really see the point he thought that since you didnt have emotions there would be no real need for you to express yourself somehow i had the feeling the opposite would be true\nwell im glad i insisted\ndata im very familiar with that handel piece how would you feel about my playing the viola part tomorrow\nill have to practice you dont have a viola\ndid you paint these\nits very good whos this\nyour daughter\nwhere is she now\ni see\nyes yes of course\nyes yes very nice data may i ask you something\ndo you think youll ever try to create an android again\nhow do you know the same thing wont happen creating a stable positronic matrix is very tricky your father lost several prototypes before lore\nthere were three of them they were like children to us losing them was very painful when noon ian decided to try again i was very much against it i didnt think we had the right to bring a life into the world with so little chance of surviving but your father was sure that he d figured out what went wrong insisted he could make a stable matrix and he did but lore was cruel evil eventually we had no choice we had to dismantle him your father decided to build yet another android one who didnt have emotions i couldnt believe he would want to try again\ninitially i was but i was wrong i know that now ive followed your progress for years im very proud of what youve accomplished\nbecause i felt guilty about something id done\ni lied when i said there was no room for you in the escape pod that we took from omicron there was i didnt want to bring you with us i was afraid if we reactivated you youd turn out like lore i made noon ian leave you behind\nwe must have hit a pocket of magnesite or e ill try to adjust the phaser harmonics to compensate\nthere is no other suitable location just give me a few more seconds\nit was just luck i hit the right frequency all right were less than two kilometres away from the target site standby to terminate the beam\nnow\nill need another minute to align the diverter\ngood were almost done here\nits all right pran i know what is aid to you must have been hard to hear but i hope you understand my reasons\nwell ill try what do you want to know\noh data how can i answer that\ni just dont want you to misunderstand my answer no i wouldnt have left you behind if you d been my biological child\nabsolutely not i cherished every android your father and i created as if it were my child even lore despite the fact that he turned on us despite the dreadful things he did dismantling him was the most difficult thing i ever had to do i was afraid that if you turned out like him i would have to dismantle you too and i couldnt bear to do that im not trying to justify leaving you behind im just sorry i did i hope you believe me\nwhat happened\nthen we must finish configuring the unit and inject the plasma immediately\nif you dont do it\nnow commander it may take months to find another suitable site the core may solidify by then\nyour e hurt ill go\nthe infusers been damaged were going to have to start the programming sequence all over again\nre initialising the particle stream buffer\nthere now we just have to realign the diverter\nthats it lets go\ncan we transport without the pattern enhancers\nhow are we going to get down there\nno its too far i wont make it\ndata what happened the last thing i remember is jumping off a cliff\nwhen willi see you again\ni would like that very much well id better be going\nthats nice to know on a treat here is a saying that a child born from parents who love each other will have nothing but goodness in his heart i guess that explains you take care of yourself son\nwe could minimise seismic activity by creating isobaric fissures and relieving some of the tectonic stress but that would just be a temporary fix\nthese pockets in the magma layer how close are they to the molten region of the core\ndata do you think thats close enough for ferro plasmic infusion\nwell trigger the units by firing modulated energy bursts down through the shafts\nfine id be very happy to help you with that doctor\ndata im almost finished reconfiguring the phaser banks we should be able to start drilling in about an hour\nwhat is it youre doing over there\ndont you believe her\nwell what have you turned up so far\nwhats that you re looking at\nthat sure fits with her story\nyou know data it almost seems to me like your e trying to prove that doctor tainer wasnt telling the truth\nwell she did leave him maybe she broke his heart maybe he just didnt want to talk about her let me ask you this doctor soong created an emotion chip didnt lore tell you that chip also contained memories memories soong wanted you to have\nwhen you think about it why would she want to lie why would anybody want to pretend to be your mother\nand i can understand that this might all be a little disconcerting for you data it came out of the blue and it doesnt fit into your logical processors\nbut thats life data part of being human is learning how to deal with the unexpected to risk new experiences even when they dont fit into your preconceptions\ndata i reconfigured the phasers to create the most highly focused particle beam possible\ndata thats hard to picture\nlaforge here go ahead commander\nphaser modifications are online sir\nwere picking up feedback pulses along the particle beam\ndoctor its going to take longer than that to match the\nyou did it\nweve broken through\nit looks like the area has stabilised but seismic stress is building up eventually the pocket will collapse\nits tough to tell commander twelve hours at most\nbasically she sa soong type android except everything about her is designed to fool you into thinking she shuman\nits part of her aging programme not only does she age in appearance like data her vital signs change too\ndata come take a look at this\nif you give your permission we could begin immediately\nive assigned you quarters during out time here please make yourselves comfortable\ndata what do you think\ndata there might come sometime in the future when she would find out anyway another accident perhaps maybe it would be easier for her if she learned the truth from you\nits a difficult choice you must do what you think best data but whatever decision you make we will support it\nour gravitational field has been affected seismic activity has increased by a factor of three\nif it works the core would remain molten for centuries\nvery well but before we proceed id like to update our geological surveys\nthank you captain juliana\nsomeones checked his calculations of course\neven so he is a machine someone should check upon him\ncommander may i suggest we set up the infusion unit in the first magma pocket and give this one a chance to cool\nthere are signs of stress in the surrounding magma but the site should remain stable until we finish the plasma infusion\ndata juliana told me what she said to you last night shes been very upset i dont blame you for being angry with her\nwe were running a final check on the infusion units when a part of the wall gave way\nshes right we have to act now\nbridge to engineering\nweve established asynchronous orbit over the drilling site\nacknowledged\nno but im sure mister data knows what he s doing\ni have complete confidence in mister data s ability to check upon himself mister worf\nfire when ready\ngood work data\ni dont think we could have gotten it any cleaner\ndata were going to have to terminate

geordi\nid rather not send anyone back down there\nall right but i want you in and out of there as quickly as possible\nriker to data are you there\nwere reading an increase in seismic stress levels\ndata are you all right\nwhy does the scanner read her as a human\nyou said you knew she was an android how\nthat could have just meant she was good at math\nonly you could have noticed something like that\nwhat about it\ndoes her husband know anything about this\nprobably just as well\nwhoever you are you must have found out about juliana\ni programmed this hologram to answer any questions you might have i am noon ian soon gi created her\ndata i hoped somehow it might be you i even created a response programme to answer your questions how are you boy\nim glad you got the chance to meet your mother\nyour e right but there was a real juliana odonnell she was my wife she helped me create you\nshe was injured when the crystalline entity attacked we made it as far a sterlin a three but she slipped into a coma when i realised nothing could be done for her i built an android i tried to perfect my synaptic scanning technique so that i could transfer julian as memories into a positronic matrix i didnt know if it would work but i had to try i couldnt stand the thought of losing the only woman i ever loved a few days after juliana died i activated the android she looked up at me and smiled she recognised me it had worked here was a life not two minutes old and as far as she knew i was her husband shed just recovered from a terrible injury it was incredible\nwhy there was no reason for her to know i wanted her to be happy i wanted us to be happy we were for awhile\ni made a terrible mistake i never really let her know how much i loved her so she left me the real juliana probably would have left too if shed lived\nshe doesnt have to know i designed her to shut down in the event the truth was discovered when you put that chip back in she will wake up and remember nothing all you have to do is makeup some excuse about what happened to her\ntruth the truth is in every way that matters she is juliana soon gi programmed her to terminate after a long life let her live out her days and die believing she was human dont rob her of that son please\ni dont think so she s believed she shuman all her life the truth might be devastating to her\nwhat do you mean\ni know how much that means to you data but at the same time by telling her your e robbing her of the one thing youve wanted all your life to be human\nphasers locked on

how your first coupling took place i could investigate it\ni am detecting no temporal anomalies in this system perhaps we should try to pinpoint the exact moment when events became discontinuous do you remember the first change\nthink back are you sure that was the very first change\nwe should try to find the commonalties in these events where were the people you were with\nit is possible we should speak to commander laforge\ndoctor is geordi well enough to answer some questions\nthere do not appear to be any unusual readings energy residuals from the plasma burns the beginnings of cellular decomposition i see nothing that connects these bio readings to your recent sense of discontinuity\ni still see nothing unusual perhaps we should activate it\nthe visor is active\nhave you noticed another discontinuity\ni am detecting a quantum flux in your cellular rna\ni do not know i will have to analyse these readings\ni have found the quantum flux in worf s cellular extends to the subatomic level it is asynchronous with normal matter in essence captain mister worf does not belong in our universe\nall matter in the universe resonates on a quantum level with a unique signature that signature is constant it can not be changed through any known process it is the basic foundation of existence\nyes sir i can not explain it it is as if he originates from a different quantum universe\naye sir\nit appears to be a quantum fissure in the spacetime continuum\nthe anomaly can not be seen but i believe i can enhance it with a warp field to make it visible\nnot from this distance siri am also detecting anion trail intersecting the phenomenon i believe it was left by a starfleet type six shuttlecraft\ni have an explanation sir\ni believe the quantum fissure we discovered is a fixed point across the spacetime continuum a keyhole which intersects many other quantum realities\nfor any event there is an infinite number of possible outcomes our choices determine which outcomes will follow but there is a theory in quantum physics that all possibilities that can happen do happen in alternate quantum realities\nthat is correct\nwhen worf s shuttlecraft came into contact with the quantum fissure i believe its warp engines caused a small break in the barriers between quantum real ties worf was thrown into a state of quantum flux he immediately shifted into other realities\nexactly the visor uses a subspace field pulse i believe that whenever geordi came near worf the field pulse intensified the quantum flux and pushed worf into another reality\nan excellent idea lieutenant\ncaptain a bajoran ship is approaching\nthe barriers between quantum real ties are breaking down other real ties are emerging into our own\nthe rate of quantum incursions is increasing exponentially at this rate the sector will be completely filled with enterprises within three days\nperhaps if we can find the ship which that commander worf s quantum signature\nit was worf s shuttlecraft which traversed the fissure and weakened the barriers between quantum realities if here enters the fissure in his original shuttle and emits a broad spectrum warp field it may be enough to seal the fissure and stop additional realities from emerging into our own\nin theory the act of sealing the fissure should restore the barriers between quantum states the ships would return to their own realities\nyes sir it matches commander worf s quantum signature precisely i have re modulated the shuttles engines to emit an inverse warp field you will need to activate the field at the precise moment you enter the fissure\nthat is one possibility however the uncertainty principle dictates that time is a variable in this equation you may end up several days before the event or several days after there is no way to tell\ncaptain worf is entering the fissure\naye sir\naye sir\nthis is ensign hayes sir commander laforge has been taken to sickbay with plasma burns theres serious damage to the secondary plasma conduit but i think we ve got it under control\naye sir\nnice the battle of haro s right\nworf are you all right\nthank you doctor\nwhat is it worf\nthis is deep space five star base forty seven the ia dara colony and the utopia planitia shipyards\nwere only three light years from cardassian space they would have easy access to the array\nworf heres a propulsion analysis of the cardassian ship you might try scanning for its energy configuration\nworf you dont look so good maybe you ought to go to sickbay\ncounsellor worf i wanted you to know that were examined the imaging logs they dont show a cardassian ship or any evidence that the array was reprogrammed from what we can tell the array suffered a simple mechanical failure\nworf maybe you should come with me to sickbay and\nwe were wondering the same thing about you captain why would starfleet s flagship want to venture so close to the cardassian border\ni see may we offer our assistance\nif you dont mind my asking what exactly is this telescope of yours designed to do\nim certain it would never be used to observe a neighbouring species\nwell then best of luck with your repairs just try to make certain that your studies are limited to astronomical phenomena\ncounsellor troi please report to sickbay\ngeordi s dead\nwhat about his visor\nhook it up to the diagnostic array and ill check it out\nso how old are you mister worf\ni wouldnt miss this for the world how old are you\nreport\nwhere is the information being sent now\nmake it so\ntheyre responsible for new starship development\nmister worf start a long range scan of the region see if there are any cardassian ships nearby\nopen a channel\nthis is captain jean luc picard of the starship enterprise you are in federation territory please explain your presence here\nwe are repairing one of our subspace telescopes\nno thank you everything is under control\nits a long range subspace array we use it for gathering data on astronomical phenomena\ncertainly not\nwhat are you saying\nthe imaging logs are you suggesting that you have evidence the cardassians have tampered with the array\ni havent heard anything about this\nmister worf are you feeling all right\nmister data perhaps you had better reexamine the array see if you can find any evidence to support mister worf s claims\nnow mister worf now\nnumber one\nensign take us out of here maximum warp\nare they pursuing us\nbridge to engineering mister laforge whats your status\nacknowledged ensign lay in a course to starbase one two nine\nwhat happened back there lieutenant\ngranted\ncaptain it would that we have found the quantum signature you are looking for\nour data has said the same thing\nwere launching it now\nenterprise here\nyes lieutenant is there a problem\nhow was the bat leth tournament\nit looks like were going to have to head into to the argus array this is the third time this year its stopped relaying data starfleet s beginning to think its more than a simple malfunction i want you to start a long range scan once we get lieutenant are you listening to me\nyou seem awfully tense for a man who just came back from vacation\nwhats the matter with you\na surprise party mister worf i hate surprise parties i would never do that to you\nsettle in ill meet you on the bridge\ni love surprise parties\ncaptain picard sends his birthday wishes he was needed on the bridge\nthat cant be right we were told the array stopped relaying data six days ago\nwhats in that sector\ncaptain i suggest we beam a repair crew aboard the array we can begin downloading their imaging logs find out what the arrays been observing for the past six days\nmister data\ncharming fellow\nneither have i\nwhat are you waiting for raise the shields\nfiring photon torpedoes full spread\ndirect hit on their main reactor theyre returning fire\nno sir they are firing on the argus array they destroyed it sir\nmemory loss what are you talking about\nwhat\nare you saying that worf s quantum signature is different from ours\nmister worf you say the discontinuities started to occur after you returned from a bat leth tournament on for cas three\nnow i know for a fact that you never attended that tournament and that no shuttlecraft has left the enterprise for over a month\ndo you remember the route you took to return\nlets backtrack that course see if there are any unusual readings or anomalies\nfour years ever since captain picard was killed in the incident with the borg you dont remember any of this do you\nfull stop\nanalysis mister data\non screen\nis it dangerous\nred alert\nyesterday they destroyed one of our subspace telescopes because they thought we were using it to spy on them\nreturn fire\ncan we disengage the pulse\nwhat the hell is happening\ni wish i knew what to tell them mister data can we stop these incursions\nhow would that help\nwhat then how do we get the enterprises that are already here back to where they belong\nlieutenant crusher send a general hail all ships\nthis is captain riker of the enterprise that is the enterprise which is indigenous to this universe weve all encountered a quantum anomaly we think we have found a way to return all of us to our proper realities but we need to find that ship which exhibits a certain quantum signature our mister data will transmit that signature to you now\nanything\non screen\ndata believes that by sending worf back through the fissure again it would return us all to our proper realities\nwe need you to send us your shuttlecraft curie\nthank you its good to see you again captain its been a long time\ndid they send the right shuttle\ngood luck\nacknowledged\nthe bajoran s again\non screen\nwe wont go back you dont know what its like in our universe the federations gone theborg is everywhere were one of the last ships left please you ve got to help us\nim sorry theres no choice if this works everything will return to\nno we wont go back\nopen fire try to disable them\nwhat happened\nprobably from fighting with the borg\nso you think this quantum fissure is nothing that we need to worry about\nim looking forward to reading your report\nsomething wrong\nsurprised i dont know what your e talking about\nwhat\nit wasnt easy to translate there doesnt seem to be a klingon word for jolly\ni think its wonderful and i know just where to put it\ni always thought this room could use a little more colour\ndont i wish this is from alexander he gave it me just before he left to visit your parents thank you\nhe wished he could have been here when you got back from shore leave you should have seen him worf he stayed up all night talking about how proud he was of his father\noh it was my pleasure\nof course\noh\nmost children do\nworf thats one of the nicest things anyones ever said to me\nhis sohc him\ni dont know what to say its a great honour so that would make me your\nthat would make my mother your stepmother\ni accept\nworf lets assume for a second your e right that things did happen as you remember them are you saying that everyone s memory on this ship has been altered but yours\nwhats wrong\nworf i hung that painting there at your birthday party remember\nwhy d you lock the door\ni heard what happened on the bridge are you all right\ndo you want to talk about it\nvery well lieutenant hot chocolate\nactually there is\ncome and sit down i just want you to relax for a minute there you are so tense now i know you dont want to talk about what happened on the bridge but there are times when its just best to let things outcome on if you cant talk to me who can you talk to\neven for your wife\nworf whats wrong\nwhats changed\nare you saying you dont remember the last three years you dont remember us falling in love and getting married\nwhatevers wrong whatever happened i want you to know that i believe you and that iloveyou and together well find out whats happening\nim on my way let me know if you find anything\nyour e a commander and first officer\nyes\nwhat do you mean quantum realities\nhow did this happen\nworf from what i understand theres a good chance my worf wont return i guess its just hard for me to accept that theres a reality out there where you never loved me\nwhat about our children\nyou didnt know\nwe have a little girls hanna rashes two years old and a three year old boy eric christopher\nalexander\never since the bajoran s overpowered the cardassian empire theyve become more and more aggressive\nwelcome home worf i hope you dont mind i let myself ini promised alexander id feed his d alvin hissing beetle while you were both away\nwhats that supposed to mean\nhappy birthday worf will wanted to give you a surprise party but i knew you d hate it so i talked him out of it\ni know klingons like to be alone on their birthdays im sure you have to meditate or hit yourself with a pain stick or something\noh\nid love to\ncaptain im picking up a minor subspace disturbance off the port bow\nwe could scan the quantum fissure using a subspace differential pulse maybe we could locate the quantum state that shares worf s signature and find a way to get him back\nive used a differential pulse to analyze over ten million quantum states within the fissure but i still havent found one with your signature this may take some time sir\nthey recharging their weapons sir\ntheyve damaged our power systems sir its caused an energy surge within the subspace pulse the quantum fissure is beginning to destabilise\ntoo late sir\nthe bajoran ship is disengaging sir\ncaptain were receiving two hundred eighty five thousand hails\naye sir\ntheres too much comm traffic sir its tough to isolate who stalking to who wait a minute here it is someones responding\ncaptain the shuttlecraft is under attack\nno sir its one of the enterprises theyre hailing us\nsir theyre firing on the shuttlecraft\ndirect hit their shields have collapsed their engine core is overloading\nit looks like the ship had already taken heavy damage their warp containment field must have been weak\npersonal log stardate 473912iam returning from the bat leth competition on for cas three the conditions were difficult several contenders were maimed but i was triumphant iwon champion standing i am looking forward to resuming my duties aboard the enterprise however i am anticipating a troubling situation\nhmm yes sir\ntoday is my birthday\nbecause it is my birthday i assumed that you or one of the others would try to mount an unexpected social gathering\ni am sorry commander\naye sir\nthat was not a klingon song\nthank you\naha painting\nthe battle of haro s\nwhat are you doing\nyes yes i think data s painting is making me dizzy\ni thought the cake was chocolate\nit is a cast of alexanders forehead the ridges of a warrior\nthankyou for watching him while i was away\ncaptain i was told you could not attend\ni am old enough\nit is uninhabited but there could be a ship or a subspace relay station receiving the data\nexcuse me counsellor do you have a moment\ni have been meaning to speak with you about alexander\nit has never been easy for me having alexander on board i have always tried to be a good father to give him guidance but he seems to have his own mind about some things\ni could not have come this far without your help alexander looks up to you at times i have felt that you are like a mother to him\none time when i thought i was going to die i asked you to watch over alexander i was wondering if you might consider formalising that arrangement i want you to be alexanders sohc him\nyou would become his surrogate mother in case anything ever happened to me you would be responsible for him\nthe closest

concussion\nno\niwon that tournament and i can prove it to you\nit says ninth place this is not the same trophy someone is playing a trick on me\nthe log i recorded a personal log on my way back to

approaching galor class\non screen\ncaptain that ship was responsible for reprogramming the array\nit is the same class and energy configuration as the ship we saw in the imaging logs\nthey are using the array as a surveillance device you saw the logs yourself\ncommander data show them the logs you downloaded from the array\nyes\ndoctor crusher says i am experiencing further memory loss but my instincts tell me it is more than that i remember those imaging logs i could tell you every detail every word\nenter\nthat is not right i was certain that\ncounsellor the painting that commander data gave me it has moved\nno\nthe painting has changed dont you see it\nyour hair and your clothing they have changed as well\nthis panel configuration has been altered i do not know how\ni believe i

am not sure\ni would rather not counsellor\nis there something i can do for you\ni do not believe this is appropriate behaviour\nwife\ni do not know things are changing\ni do not remember us you and i being mates it is as if events circumstances continue to change from moment to moment but i am the only one who seems to be aware of it\ni do remember the last three years but they were different we did not have this relationship we were friends and the enterprise did not have a battle with the cardassians and no one believes me\ncommander how long have i been married to counsellor troi\nand when did this relationship begin\nand then we mated\nno that is all right\ni was in sickbay doctor crusher told me i had a concussion but i do not remember that happening\nbefore yes yes i was in engineering i felt a wave of dizziness and when i looked up you and commander laforge were on the opposite side of the room captain picard was gone i thought i had blacked out for a moment and had not observed your movements and at my birthday party the cake was chocolate and then it was yellow and commander riker told me captain picard was not going to attend and then suddenly he was there\neveryone was at my birthday party then i was with counsellor troi then commander laforge came in geordi geordi was present at all three locations and he was near me in each case just before i noticed the differences there has to be a connection\ndoctor crusher was not here doctor ogawa was\nmy uniform has changed what is my rank and position\nare we still married\nwhat does that mean\nyes sir\ni understand that but i also clearly remember attending the tournament and returning to the ship in a shuttlecraft\nyes\nif i may inquire sir how long have you been captain of the enterprise\ni do remember i just remember differently\nso i was here\nand somehow i have been shifting from one reality to another\nhow can we find my original quantum state and return me to it\ndeanna i have always considered you a close friend and although i have never seriously considered a romantic relationship i would not be opposed to the possibility\nchildren\nwhen the last shift occurred in sickbay

    "episode 162": "captain what is your status\ngood im postponing the quasar study for the moment the enterprise is to rendezvous with the starship crazyhorse in sector one six zero seven immediately your e authorised to exceed warp speed limitations for the duration of this assignment\nid prefer not to discuss it over subspace channels the crazyhorse will be carrying someone from starfleet intelligence hell brief you when he arrives\ncaptain picard day\nim sure you are starfleet out\ncaptain starfleet places the highest priority on the success of this mission your request for a delay is denied\ni know that the chief of starfleet intelligence herself is watching this one jean luc so you dbe well advised to follow press mans orders and leave it at that starfleet out\naye sir\nwhats wrong\nexcuse me what were you doing\nits broken all right give him ten cc softer a kine for the pain\nyou both must have got a little carried away thats all\nit can happen to anyone\nthere all better will its all right you made a mistake no harm done youll be better next time\ncaptain we are approaching the devol in system\nno sir\ninitiating sensor sweep of grid zero one\nscan of grid one five seven is complete i am moving to grid one five eight\ni have confirmed geordi s readings the resonance signature is originating from somewhere beneath the asteroids surface\nthis asteroid contains several deep chasms large enough for a starship to enter it is possible the pegasus drifted into the asteroids gravitational field and was pulled down into one of the fissures\nat least another six hours sir\nin order for the deception to succeed it would have to appear to be a natural phenomenon verter on particles are artificial in nature\ntheoretically sir it should work\naye sir initiating ionisation field pulse\nionisation pulse complete\nthe romulans are initiating a tachyon scan of the asteroid they have switched to their lateral sensor array beginning another scan\nthe warbird has completed its sensor sweep\nthey are moving out\nyes sir\nbeginning sensor sweeps\naye sir\nfor the past several hours i have been scanning the area where we detected the resonance signature of the pegasus from the strength and polarity of the signature it would appear that most of the warp core is still intact\ni would recommend against it sir there may be gravimetric or magnetic fluctuations inside the asteroid which would overpower the engines of a shuttlecraft\nit is theoretically possible sir but i am unaware of any prior situations where a starship was taken so deeply inside a planetary body there may be unforeseen difficulties\nit is so noted sir\nwe are now two kilometres beneath the surface\nsensors show that the ship is still intact however sixty five percent of it is contained within the asteroid\nyes sir i do not understand how this could have happened\nthe starboard bulkhead of main engineering is contained within the rockface but most of its compartment is still intact\ni believe so sir the breach can be temporarily sealed by extending our shields\nthe asteroids internal structure is highly unstable any attempt to cut through the rock could cause the entire chasm to collapse\ntheoretically it is possible sir but it would take several hours to study the device and determine how to link it to our systems\ncourse plotted sir\nwhat would the romulans want with pieces of a twelve year old starship\nwell need metallurgical and chromo graphic specs on the pegasus in order to set up the proper search parameters\ntheres an awful lot of ionising radiation in this system captain that and the sheer amount of rock is going to slow down our search a little\nid say at least\nat least seven days sir\ntheresa subspace resonance signature coming from that asteroid sir it could be the warp core of the pegasus\nwait a minute we could blanket the asteroid with high levels of ionising radiation theres so much of it in the system already the romulans wont know the difference\ncommander weve routed the impulse engines through the plasma conduits but you ll have to watch the intercooler levels if they get too high well blow the entire relay system\nlaforge to bridge\nthe cloak is online and ready to begin phase sequencing\ni dont know why we have to do this every year i thought that last year the teachers had agreed that they wouldnt do this anymore\nwhy does it have to be me\nwell they seem to have a somewhat exaggerated impression of me\nisnt there something else you have to do\nput it through mister worf excuse me counsellor\nyes admiral\nwe are conducting energy output studies of theme kori a quasar all systems normal the ship is fully operational\ni understand what is our assignment\nvery well\no her yes it ser its for the children imer haha im a role model\npaul men e gay a seven year old he did a most interesting clay sculpture of my head\nyes oh youll be interested to know that ive arranged for a commander riker day next month im even considering making an entry myself\nenergise\npressman yes of course you were wills first commanding officer on the pegasus\ni remember hearing about it the ship was destroyed by a warp core breach as i recall\nwhat are our orders\nvery well lay in a course for the devol in system\nany sign of the romulans\nmister laforge\nhow slow\non screen\ni am captain jean luc picard of the federation starship enterprise\nnot at all but your unannounced appearance might have unfortunate consequences it would be an awful shame if your ship were damaged due to some misunderstanding\ni might ask you the same question\nhow interesting so are we perhaps we could combine our efforts and share our findings\nperhaps your e right\nthen i wont keep you\nstand down red alert but keep tracking their movement lieutenant\ncommander how long will it take us to search this system\nthen lets get to it mister data\nas a matter of fact i never met will until he reported on board at farpoint station\ni was looking through the records of about fifty candidates and wills was much like all the others filled with lots of dry statistics and glowing letters of recommendation that tell you nothing i was about to put it aside and look at another file and then something caught my eye there was an incident on altair three when will was first officer of the hood he refused to let captain desoto beam down during a crisis he disobeyed a direct order and he risked a general court martial because he thought he was right when i read that i knew that i had found my number one\ni wanted someone who would stand up to me someone who was more concerned with the safety of the ship and accomplishing the mission than with how something looked on his record to me thats one of the marks of a good officer\ni am aware of that admiral\nadmiral the record regarding the loss of the pegasus is a bit vague from the moment just before you abandoned ship is there anything that you can add to the official account\nput the asteroid on the main viewscreen\nmister data how long will it take to determine the exact location of the pegasus\nmister data would it possible to saturate the asteroid with verter on particles that could mask the resonance signature and prevent the romulans from detecting it\nmister data\nmake it so mister data\nwhen he s finished well have to move away and make it look like weve scanned the asteroid but havent find anything\nif it works the romulans wont find anything and we can return later if it doesnt\nhelm one quarter impulse engage\nmister data we must convince the romulans that were still looking for the pegasus i want you to continue scanning this system\ni want to be back at this asteroid at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow plan your search pattern accordingly\nadmiral would you care to join me for some late dinner\nyou have the bridge number one oh and will you bring the scan analysis to my quarters when your e off watch\ncome\nthank you\nyes there is judge advocate generals report stardate 36764 subject inquiry into mutiny aboard pegasus based on testimony from captain pressman and other surviving officers the judge advocate believes there is sufficient evidence to conclude that certain members of the crew did mutiny against the captain just prior to the destruction of the pegasus mutiny on a federation starship thats shocking its unthinkable and yet youve never mentioned it\nyou know it wasnt easy to get this record i had to pull in quite a few favours at starfleet just to get a look at it it seems that it was classified by starfleet intelligence so not only was the pegasus carrying sensitive equipment which must be allowed to fall into romulan hands not only was there a mysterious explosion which seemed to destroy the ship but didnt but it seems there was a mutiny on board now ive read the official report of the inquiry on that mutiny but i want to know your version of what happened\nwhy\nand you\nthe judge advocate also believes that the surviving officers are deliberately withholding vital information from this inquiry further investigation is recommended will there was no further investigation this report was classified and then it was quietly buried why\nim taking this up with you will the judge advocate thought you were participating in a conspiracy to cover up the truth now what the hell is going on here will why did that mutiny happen why is pressman so determined to find your ship twelve years later\nvery well he san admiral ima captain i can not force you to disobey his orders therefore i will have to remain in the dark on this mission and i will just have to trust that you will not let pressman put this ship at unnecessary risk and if i find that that trust has been misplaced then i will have to reevaluate the command structure of this ship dismissed\nmargaret some things very wrong here do you know whats going on\non my way\nmister worf where are the romulans\ntake us to within fifteen kilometres of the asteroid and hold that position\nmister data report\nagreed what about a shuttle we could send it down through one of these fissures\nmister data\nadmiral i dont think we can risk\nmister data will you please note in the ships log that this action is being taken over my explicit objections\nyellow alert\nensign gates plot a course into the chasm manoeuvring thrusters only\ntake us in\nadmiral if is passage narrows to less than five hundred metres i will abort the mission you can charge me with insubordination if you wish but im not going to risk the enterprise for a salvage operation\nif we begin a power transfer can were store life support systems to that compartment\nadmiral i would like to send down a complete away team\nyes sir\npicard to away team prepare to return to the ship immediately\nthe romulans have destroyed the entrance to the chasm with their disruptors theyve sealed us in\non screen\nare you responsible for this\nwhat do you want sirol\nhow\nthankyou for your generous offer i will take it under advisement\nagreed options\nthats what its all about a cloaking device in the treaty of alger on the federation specifically agreed not to develop cloaking technology\nthat treaty has kept us in peace for sixty years and as a starfleet officer your e supposed to uphold it\nhow do we use the cloak to escape from the asteroid\ni see why you were so eager to find it\nexcept its illegal its in violation of an agreement that the federation signed in good faith\nmister data\nmake it so captains log stardate 474571 we have been trapped inside the asteroid for over eight hours mister data and commander laforge inform me that they are nearly ready to engage the cloak\nproceed number one\nreport\ntake us out manoeuvring thrusters only\ndisengage the cloaking device commander\ntheyll know the truth admiral which is what everyone will know very shortly carry out my orders\nmister worf send a message to the warbird inform them that their government will be contacted shortly about this incident\nadmiral i am here by charging you with violation of the treaty of alger on as captain of the enterprise im placing you under arrest mister worf\nyour e going to need them\nive spoken to fleet admiral shanthi there will be a full inquiry once we reach starbase two four seven and that will probably lead to a general court martial of admiral pressman and several others at starfleet intelligence your involvement in this affair is going to be thoroughly investigated will there ll be some hard questions for you to answer\nyou made a mistake twelve years ago but your service since then has earned you a great deal of respect but this incident may cost you some of that respect\nwhen the moment came to make a decision you made the right one you chose to tell the truth and face the consequences so long as you can still do that then you deserve to wear that uniform and i will still be proud to have you as my first officer back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc copyright 1966 present the star trek web pages on this site are for educational and entertainment purposes only all other copyrights property of their respective holders\nwill ill bet you never thought you d see me again\nyeah sure it is you look like your e about to faint\nthats right as a matter of fact the pegasus is the reason im here\nthe pegasus is still out there will and the romulans found her\nas you know the starship pegasus was lost in this sector some twelve years ago along with most of its crew i was the captain and commander riker here was my helmsman\nfrom space we saw what appeared to be a matter antimatter explosion which vapor is ed the ship\nhowever all that changed three days ago starfleet intelligence has an operative in romulan high command he sent us a message that a romulan warbird had located a piece of debris in the devol in system which was positively identified as being from the pegasus the warbird was then ordered to locate the rest of the ship if possible and retrieve it\nthe pegasus was a prototype experimental engine new weapon systems in fact some of our designs were used in constructing the enterprise there are a lot of things onboard the romulans would love to get their hands on\nto find the ship before the romulans do salvage it if possible destroy it if necessary you command the enterprise while i remain in command of the overall mission\nill make the appropriate information available to you\noh theyre out there theyre just waiting to see what your e going to do\nhow long have you had that beard\nwhat was it that lieutenant boyle n used to call you\nyou never did have much of a sense of humour\nreally\nwell its about time you were always so serious on the pegasus\ni wouldnt have come all the way out here if i didnt\nmay be\nso do i its not the kind of thing you just forget\nnever what happened was a tragedy yes but it wasnt your fault and it wasnt mine what we were doing was for the good of the federation and we cant blame ourselves if the others couldnt see that\nwell this time we may have a chance to do it the right way if this mission is successful if we find the pegasus and the experiment we can finish what we started twelve years ago\nits not just me will the chief of starfleet security has personally given me her assurance of complete support\nnot many and its up to us to make sure it stays that way ran er has given me written orders for you youll find them coded in the enterprise computer you ve been instructed not to reveal the true nature of our mission to anyone else not even captain picard will dont worry it wont be like it was twelve years ago and this time no ones going to stop us\nyou chose your first officer without ever meeting him\nyou wanted someone with a history of disobedience\nfrankly ive always felt it was more important for an officer to trust his captains judgment in a crisis theres no time for explanations orders have to be obeyed without question or lives may be lost\nof course you are i guess this mission has brought up some old ghosts for me you know what its like to lose a ship your e always wondering if there was something else you should have done something you missed\nim afraid not but i can tell you this twelve years ago i needed an officer that i could count on in a crisis someone who would support and obey my decisions without question someone who was willing to trust my judgment and that someone was will riker without his loyalty none of us would have survived\ni think he s right i recognise some of the variance patterns\nbeneath the surface hows that possible\nthats too long if the romulans start searching the asteroid they could find the ship before we do\nour top priority is to salvage the ship commander ill consider destroying it only as a last resort\ncaptain could you give me a third alternative\nif it doesnt work well have handed them the pegasus\nif they found the resonance signature they should be sending away teams any second\nplease excuse me captain but i think id better turn in early\ncommander i want to see you in the captains ready room\nwhat the hell is the matter with you destroy the pegasus before weve even taken a look at it\nwell you were wrong we have a chance here to change the balance of power in this quadrant but we cant very well do that if we destroy the pegasus now can we\nit has nt been easy for you im sure keeping your captain and friends in the dark like this\ni hope you understand that its necessary\nyou have changed\nsomething the captain and i were talking about to be honest im glad to see this kind of change in you will state your opinion and standby it its a far cry from the young man who used to sit at my helmand worry about pressing the wrong button\nyes they can but its important that a man changes the right things in his life no this sense of duty no this sense of loyalty\ni would like to think that too because those things say more about a man than the rank on his collar or the uniform he wears they define him twelve years ago a lot of older and more seasoned officers turned away from their duty but you stood up for what was right im sorry will i know the kind of man you are i know that i can count on you again\nif were lucky the entire engineering section could be down there\nsounds like the best solution is to take the enterprise in\nthats right put this fissure on the main viewer this chasm is large enough for us to manoeuvre in besides if we ever hope to salvage the pegasus were going to need a starship to do it\nive made my decision prepare to take the enterprise in captain that san order\npegasus\nlets keep the speculation to a minimum we have to begin the salvage operation the equipment we need was in main engineering can you scan that section of the pegasus\nsee to it once youve restored life support commander riker and i will beam directly into engineering\ntheres some very sensitive equipment over there i dont want anyone else near it\nthis room was open to space for twelve years\nwere not here for a memorial service its still intact whats the matter will dont you understand weve found it\nwhat the hell is that supposed to mean\nyou had better reconsider that position commander we have a mission to accomplish and your e going to carry it out\nkeep yourself righteous comments to yourself i knew most of these people a lot longer than you did yes it was tragic but it was their fault\nwell its not hard to guess they tried to shut down an experiment they didnt understand something went wrong and it killed them\nnow that doesnt sound like the same man who grabbed a phaser and defended his captain twelve years ago\nsoon reflection you d rather be a traitor than a hero\nand if you hadnt youd be dead right now along with all the rest of them dead because you listened to a bunch of mutinous cowards who were too blinded by fear to see what i was trying to do\nthat treaty has bound our hands and given the romulans a tactical advantage for the last sixty years i was simply trying to level the playing field\nall right you dont want to help me fine but you are still under my direct orders not to talk about what you know and i expect you to follow those orders to the letter i made you mister and i can break you just as easily do you understand me commander\nstandby enterprise\npressman to enterprise two people and one piece of equipment to beam up\nreport\nwe cant do it if we abandon the enterprise theyll come back here and get their hands on both ships\nyou just ended your career will\nand that treaty is the biggest mistake we ever made its kept us from exploiting a vital area of defence\nnow thats enough im taking command of this vessel mister worf escort the captain to his quarters\ncant you see the potential here the phasing cloak could be the greatest breakthrough in weapons research in the last fifty years\nso the ship drifted into this system still in a phased state and when it passed through this asteroid\nyou can not do that if the romulans see us de cloak theyll know\ni have a lot of friends at starfleet command captain\ni dont know i think the resemblance is rather striking wouldnt you agree number one\nill be on the bridge\nso who won the contest\nwas that the orange one with the lumpy skin\ngreat\nits good to see you sir\nno its just its been a long time captain jean luc picard admiral erik pressman\nsir\nthe captain and i along with seven others managed to get to the escape pod before the breach became critical\nno wreckage was found so starfleet officially declared the ship destroyed\naye sir\nshields up red alert prepare phasers\nabout four years i got tired of hearing how young i looked\nensign babyface\ni like to think that ive lightened up a little in my old age\nive been known to tell a joke or two\nwe went through some serious times do you really think were going to find the pegasus again\nwhat about the experiment do you think were going to find that too\ni think a lot about what happened especially on that last day\ndo you ever wonder if we did the right thing\ni know but maybe we went about it the wrong way\nyou want to try again\nadmiral ran er how many other people know about this\ni think i busted arib\ni was doing bat leth moves with mister worf i jabbed when i shouldve blocked he caught me right in the side its a good thing we were using sticks instead of the real blades\ni cant believe how stupid i was\nno it was my fault i got distracted at a crucial moment\ni knew what i was supposed to do and i didnt do it if those had real bat let hsi might be dead right now\nyeah may be\ntheyre sure spending a lot of time over there i wonder if they laforge\ncaptain picard to the bridge take us to within ten kilometres of asteroid gamma six zero one\ngeordi s found something\nthey probably want to see what were so interested in over here\ni recommend we destroy the asteroid it would take most of our photon torpedoes but it would preclude any possibility of the pegasus falling into romulan hands\nyes sir\nif we do this we have to do it fast the romulans will be within sensor range in less than a minute\nlay in a course for the next search grid standby to engage\ntheyre certainly being thorough\naye sir\naye sir\ninitiate search of grid one six three\nmister data you have the bridge\ni thought it was more important that the romulans\nno sir\ni havent enjoyed it if thats what you mean\ni understand that you think its necessary\nchanged\na lot of things can change in twelve years admiral\nid like to think that i havent changed those things sir\nthe scan analysis you asked for\nis there something else sir\nno sir\ni was on the bridge the ship was at yellow alert we were running some tests on the engines something went wrong there was an explosion in engineering heavy casualties in the midst of this crisis the first officer the chief of engineering and most of bridge crew mutinied against captain pressman\nthey thought he was jeopardising the ship\ni was seven months out of the academy my head still ringing with words like duty and honour when they turned on him i thought they were a bunch of self serving disloyal officers so i grabbed a phaser and defended my captain two or three others joined us but it was clear by then that the mutineers had most of the crew behind them we felt a need to get off the ship there was a running firefight all the way to the escape pod about five minutes after we left the ship there was an explosion\nsir may i suggest you take this up with admiral\nive said all i can i am under direct orders from admiral pressman not to discuss this sir\nbut how do we get to it i wouldnt want to try to transport through that much solid rock\ninto the asteroid\nshields up inertial dampers at maximum\nwhatthehell happened\nit looks if half the ship materialised inside solid rock\nvacuum preserved everything\ni wonder how many of the crew are buried back there\ni know i kept hoping it wouldnt be here that it had been destroyed or that it was buried in that rock back there\nit means that i cant put this off any longer right up until this moment i had the luxury of time but now ive got to make a choice and admiral im afraid my choice is this icant let you start these experiments again it was wrong twelve years ago and it is wrong today\nthats all you care about starting these damn experiments again look around this room is filled with dead bodies these people died because of this thing\nyou dont know that neither of us knows what happened after we left\nno we killed them\nive had twelve years to think about it and if i had it to do over again i would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them\ni wasnt a hero and neither were you what you did was wrong and i was wrong to support you but i was just too young and too stupid to realise it you were the captain i was the ensign i was just following orders\nthey were brave enough to risk their lives to stop you from violating a treaty the federation signed in good faith\nand now you want to try it again how many people will die this time fifty a hundred a thousand\ncaptain i have a suggestion theres a piece of equipment in admiral press mans quarters under guard which might get us out of here its a prototype for a federation cloaking device\ni dont think anyone s going to come to your defence this time\nits more than just a cloak it changes the structure of matter in theory a ship using this device could pass through normal matter\ncaptain i think we could adapt the cloak for the enterprise\nunderstood\ni think thats what happened twelve years ago the cloak blew out the plasma relays on the pegasus after we left the ship the plasma ignited in space and it looked as if the ship had been destroyed\nthe cloak failed and half the ship materialised in solid rock\naye sir activating power systems\nthe cloak appears to be functioning normally the ships matter energy phasing rate should be sufficient to pass through the asteroid\nwere approaching the surface\ntheyre still waiting for us to make up our minds\ncaptain ill have to be placed under arrest as well admiral\ni understand\ni cant help but feel i should have come forward a long time ago\ni am commander sirol of the romulan vessel teri x to whom do i have the honour of speaking\ncaptain picard ive heard so much about you a pleasure to make your acquaintance i hope our sudden appearance didnt startle you\ni am touched by your concern for my ship but i doubt we were ever in any danger may i ask what you are doing in this system\nwe are conducting a survey of gaseous anomalies\ni doubt our objectives are compatible\nthis has been a most pleasant conversation but we must return to our research\ncaptain you seem to be in a very unfortunate circumstance how can we help\nim not sure we were conducting some geological experiments on the surface of the asteroid it is entirely possible that we accidently sealed you in if only we had known you were beneath the surface if you had shared your plans with us this might have been avoided\ni dont want anything captain but i will offer to help you\nby transporting your crew aboard my ship well take you back to romulus where after a short stay as our guests you will be returned to the federation\nas you wish we will be continuing our research in this system for a while longer i await your decision\ncaptain picard day is one of the childrens favourite school activities they look forward to it all year\nbecause your e the captain and they look up to you youre a role model for them\nwill\nthe finalists will be here in half an hour you have to pick a first second and third place and four honourable mentions\nno sir\nworf to captain incoming transmission from admiral blackwell it is coded priority one\nsir romulan warbird de cloaking directly ahead\nthey are powering weapons\nsir they are hailing us\nsir they are moving off resuming their tachyon scans of the system\naye sir\nand the romulans have a two day head start\nthe romulan warship is still searching grid two seven zero\nsir the romulan warbird has altered course once again they are heading toward our position\nworf to captain picard we are approaching asteroid gamma six zero one sir\nthey are out of sensor range on the far side of the system\naye sir\ncaptain we are encountering shifts in the magnetic field density\ncaptain i am reading a large resonance signature directly ahead\nthere is a hull breach in that section\nsir there is an incoming message it is from the warbird\naye sir\ncaptain i believe we could use the phasers to cut our way out\naye sir we will reach the rockface in five seconds\nwe have passed through two kilometres of the asteroid now within one kilometre of the surface\nwe have cleared the asteroid captain the warbird is off the port bow\naye sir\nadmiral if you will come with me",
    "episode 163": "unable to comply holodeck five is in use\nunable to comply holodeck control systems have been bypassed\nyour e worried about nikolai arent you\nare the two of you close\nyou never talk much about him what she like\nthats not unusual\nsounds intriguing i look forward to meeting him\nbut arent we interfering either way if we take no action its a conscious decision to let the bora alans die\nthere are countless m class planets in federation space which can support the bora alans we need to narrow the parameters\nthere are constant border disputes in that sector\nthats pretty isolated\nno data your e right its just that the enormity of what were doing is overwhelming we are deciding the future of a species\nthere are so many questions we dont have answers to what if the climate is so different that it affects them in a way that we cant anticipate how do we even know they ll be able to survive and if they do how will their society evolve and what impact will it have on the vac can system we have no idea what this decision will mean to their future\nall right data vacca six it is\nim sorry there is nothing i can do his neural physiology is unusual i cant wipe his memory\nas well as can be expected ive given him a mild sedative and trois been speaking with him and he seems much calmer\ni think so\ni think it was some form of ritual suicide\nhe would have died even if we had nt interfered\nare you saying your e sorry we saved the bora alans\nthe planets atmosphere is dissipating sir intense plasmon ic reactions are destroying it the stratosphere is already breaking down there are turbulent radiation storms across much of its surface i estimate that the planet will be uninhabitable in less than thirty eight hours\natmospheric dissipation is a rare and essentially unpredictable event when it occurs it proceeds rapidly doctor roz henk o may not have had sufficient warning\nthe dissipation effect is generating plasmon ic energy bursts\ni do not believe so however we may experience intermittent system failures and power surges as a result\ncaptain atmospheric dissipation has accelerated over the past several hours i estimate the planets atmosphere will be completely gone within three minutes\nthe mesosphere is gone plasmon ic reactions are now beginning to break down the troposphere\nit appears the plasmon ic reactions are continuing to interfere with our sensors\ni had siri will attempt to engage additional filtering elements visual reestablished\nthere appears to be an unusual power drain in the eps distribution net\nunknown sir it is difficult to localize\nit will take approximately nine and one half hours to complete the analysis\nthat is correct sir\nthese are the two planets which best match our search criteria dray go four features an unusually large temperate zone however it is within three light years of cardassian space\nthe alternative is vacca six it is located in the cabral sector\nit offers a less hospitable climate than the bora alans are accustomed to however it would still appear to be the better choice do you disagree doctor\nit is a formidable responsibility\ndoctor i do not believe we can offer any guarantees we can simply make the best choice we have at the moment\ndata to bridge\nwe have located a new home for the bora alans sir\nit is vacca six in the cabral sector\nwe are in synchronous orbit above the beam down site sir\nits too dangerous the storms can occur without warning if youre caught in one\nwe cant survive in here our supplies wont last forever\nwhat does it mean\nmay i speak with you\ni dont know what nikolai said to you but please forgive him\nive never seen him like this hes usually so confident so sure of himself but now he seems different do you know why\never since vor in was lost people have been afraid worried that we wont reach our new home we need nikola is strength now more than ever when the storms first came to our village many of us were ready to die but nikolai refused to let us he gathered us together and led us into caves he saved us he is a brave and compassionate man and i love him please go to him make things right between you i want us to be a family\nyes i want you to consider yourself my brother after all your e going to be the uncle of my child\nwhat does it mean\nnikolai dont\ncomputer open holodeck five\nand as a result the holodeck imaging processor has been severely destabilised\naye sir\naye sir\nwho is this\nour seer died when the storms first came we ve been without his guidance for many weeks\nwhats wrong\nseer i am an old man would you help me with my gear\nthat is tar ran a my daughter i am fortunate she was old enough to survive the storms\nshe is a beautiful girls he has not been promised to anyone if i do not reach our new home i would like her to become your wife\nthank you see r\nwe will be killed\nthe tents wont protect us\ncaptain you d better take a look at this\nwe ve got a problem sir i dont think its going to be possible to keep this holodeck simulations table\nthe plasmon ic energy surges from the planet are affecting the ships systems were having problems with the systems and the power distribution matrix\nits not a question of whether the simulation will break down its a question of when\nnot while its running in order to fix it id have to shut down all of the holodeck sand re initialise the entire system\naye sir\nhangin there worf give me just a second there that should do it\nim running every stabilisation routine i know\nwell be there in less than eight hours your e just going to have to hold things together a little while longer\na few more hours captain but we ve got some problems here\ni dont think the holodeck s going to last that long weve had materialisation errors and resolution failures all over the place and its getting worse the simulation could fall apart any minute\naye sir\nill see what i can do\nall right all right its okay do you need some help its okay\ni would know that voice anywhere worf is it really you its good to see you youve changed a lot in four years\nyes oh worf this is my brother worf hes come to help us\nthey were dying i refused to sit there safe in that observation post and watch it happen i setup a deflector shield to screen these caves from the radiation and then i brought them here\nthey think im a bora alan i told them i was from another village far from here\nwhen i sent the distress call i knew the enterprise was in this sector but i wasnt sure you dbe the one to come im so glad that your e here worf\ni want to discuss that with your captain\nfriends my brother and i must go back to the surface he has provisions and will need help bringing them here well return shortly\ndont worry worf is a seer he understands the nature of the storm shell know when its safe to travel\nnov or in worf and i will be safe well return shortly\ni was trying to give them a future what i propose is we create an atmospheric shield on the planet we can camouflage the equipment just as was done with my observation post no one will ever know its there\nindeed i am i realise it will only provide atmosphere for a limited area on the surface but it will be enough to save one village\ncaptain the bora alans have a rich and beautiful culture a deep spiritual life they deserve the chance to survive and isnt that what the prime directive was truly intended to do to allow cultures to survive and grow naturally\nexactly we have the power to save some of them all we have to do is exercise it\nsome of my log recorders are still in my observation post they contain most of my research since it appears that the only way im going to preserve bora alan culture is in a museum i request permission to return to the surface and retrieve them\nill do it myself\ncaptain ive completed my data uplink with your permission i would like to integrate my research logs with the ships library computer\ni find no honour in this whatsoever captain you will forgive me if i dont stay\nworf come in\ni have to show you something whatever you do stay quiet\nlook\nive done what you refused to do ive saved them\ni started thinking about this days ago when it became clear the planet was doomed i knew if i could get access to your ships computer i could generate a replica of the caves the hard part was transporting the bora alans into the holodeck without anybody on the enterprise noticing but i was able to blank out the sensors and make it look like interference from the plasmon ic bursts and it worked perfectly the bora alans were transported while they were sleeping they never knew anything had happened\nits a simple plan really thats the beauty of it worf trust me this is going to work\ni wasnt going to let those people die just because your captain started quoting federation dogma to me\nduty thats all that really matters to you isnt it well i refuse to be bound by an abstraction the lives of the people of bora al are far more important to me you worry too much worf you always did everything will work out\ni know that captain and i would do it all again\ni didnt beam them up without a plan ive given this a lot of thought i think we can find a new planet an m class world that can be their new home\nthats where the holodeck comes in ill go back and tell the bora alans were going on a journey to a different place where they ll be safe from the storms the holodeck can gradually change the terrain as we travel so that at the end the holodeck simulation will match the conditions on the new planet then well simply beam them down\ncaptain i cant prepare for every contingency but i assure you im accustomed to thinking on my feet ill deal with the situation as it evolves\nthank you captain\nand as a result the holodeck imaging processor has been severely destabilised\nwell just have to hope the simulation holds long enough\ncaptain ill return to the holodeck as soon as my surgical alterations are completed and ill prepare the bora alans for their journey\nmy friends we have returned we have food this is difficult to say but you have a right to hear it by the time worf and i had reached the surface the village was gone the storms have destroyed everything there is nothing for us to return to\nthats why we must leave there is a place far from here where there are no storms it will be a difficult journey but in the end we will have a new home\nmy brother is a seer if he says well be safe you must trust that we will be safe\nyou see our journey is already blessed the road ahead is long let us have a meal together then well make preparations to leave\nworf very good work apparently we dont make such a bad team after all\nworf dont we both share the same goal arent we both trying to make this plan work\nim not ashamed of what i did im not sorry i saved their lives\nim not here to work out the issues of our childhood im here to save a people who i care about and if that upsets you then so be it\ndo bara you go on ahead\nit ll be dark soon in a few hours would you ask mister laforge to create a suitable campsite for us a few kilometres from here whats wrong\nhow did he get out\nwhat will they do with him\nwait are you saying that if vor in wants to come back in here theyll let him\nbut if he comes back here and tells the others what he has seen on the enterprise everything we have done will be for nothing\nif you mean by that that im willing to do something while others hesitate thats true\noh if only i could have been like you worf the perfect son\nof course not you were too busy doing your duty\ni dont owe you an explanation this is a matter between do bara and me\nand as usual you are here to point out the error of my ways\ni have not i love her and were going to raise our child together\nyou will have to kill me first\nthe storms have returned\nno you wont worf has the power to end the storms once and for all\nworf will protect you you must trust him hurry hurry get to your tents now\nget in get in the storm is getting worse stay inside worf and i will take care of you\nas i said he would my brother worf has saved us all captains log stardate 474272theboraalans have safely reached the site of what will eventually become their new village none of them suspects they ever left their planet however our success has come at a high price\ngo inside\nplease\ni told you you would have to kill me to get me away from here\nthings were never easy between us were they\nits my fault if id been more like you we wouldnt have had so many problems\nand i intend to share that life with them the village will need a new chronicle someone will have to begin it my child will need a father my place is here im finally taking responsibility\ni learn quickly\nits yours\nthey wont understand\nanalysis mister data\nwhat was that\nkeep an eye on it mister worf any luck\nespecially under these circumstances\nvery well but regardless of this planets immediate situation we must observe the prime directive i want to minimise the risk of contact with the inhabitants you will go alone mister worf and i want to have you surgically altered so that you could pass as a bora alan\ndoctor you were fully aware that the atmospheric dissipation could not be stopped what did you hope to accomplish by assisting these people\ni have no intention of compounding what you have done by committing another gross violation of the prime directive\nwe are sworn to uphold the principle of the prime directive and until that is changed there is no further course of action that we can take is that understood\nim afraid that wont be possible but you can have full use of the ships computer to set up a comm link and upload your data from here if there s nothing further your e dismissed\nof course\nput it on screen\nwhats going on\nthis is one of those times when we must face the ramifications of the prime directive and honour those lives which we can not save\nyou have the bridge number one\nyou realise your career is finished\nwhat do you expect us to do now you have left us with a colony of bora alans who think they re still on their planet\na home which would look very different from bora al you cant really believe that they ll be fooled\nwhat if it doesnt work what if they become aware that something strange is going on\nim not enthusiastic about this plan but i dont see that we have another option very well lets give it a try\neven then theres no guarantee that well find a suitable planet\nwhat is it\nwhy not\ntheres no way round it\nthat will take hours\nvery well lets try it mister laforge i want you to monitor the situation very carefully and keep an open comm link with the holodeck so as to be apprised of any problems\nconsidering the situation you have put us in i dont think its wise to leave you alone with those people mister worf will accompany you\nmister worf the bora alans already know you theres no need to introduce them to anyone new\nkeep a close eye on your brother i dont want him making this situation worse than it is\npicard here\nvery well helm set course for vacca six\ni see how is he\ndoes he understand the situation\ncontact mister worf make sure he knows whats going on\nvor in isnt it\nyour planet was dying it could no longer support life we took you away from it\nwe have the ability to create the illusion of other places like the caves on your planet you have actually spent the last two days here on this starship not on bora al\nvor in listen to me we can visit many other worlds we can take you to one where you can build a new life\na chance for your culture your people to survive and grow\ngood mister laforge how much longer before we can transport the bora alans\nwell have the transporter room standing by but we may have to transport the bora alans whether your e ready or not please keep mister worf apprised\nyou have the bridge number one we still have one more problem to worry about\nwe have arrived at the planet that i told you about have you made a decision\ni see what do you intend to tell them\nif you tell them the truth what will happen will they believe you\nperhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination or that your e insane\non the other hand they may believe your fantastic story they would learn about alien worlds starships\nthen stay here make a future for yourself with us\nhe said that he had nowhere to go\nbut he wouldnt have died alone and afraid\nno of course not our plan for them worked out well but i wish that vor in could have bridged the gap between our two cultures i would have liked the chance to have known him better\nthe distress call came in only four days ago why would doctor roz henk o have waited so long before sending it\nis there any danger to the ship\nhe could be hurt maybe he cant respond\nits not like him to the post\nthat cant be native to the planet the bora alans dont have anything close to that level of technology\nyou cant be serious\ni thought you had compensated for that\nhelm take us out of orbit set a course for starbase eighty seven warp five\nwhat happened\nwhats the source\nall right mister worf get a security team on it\nwe can reach that in forty two hours at maximum warp sir\nall right everybody back off back off\nlook\nnot entirely the prime directive was designed to ensure noninterference\ni know things must look very strange to you but every things going to be all right no ones going to hurt you were friends of nikolai and worf dont be afraid\nyes hes my friend that means you are too i promise i wont hurt you\nhere he is now this is captain picard\nyes\nwhat are you doing here your e not from our village who are you\nhow did you survive the storms\nbut if you were able to get here the storms must have subsided\ndo you think its safe enough to return to the surface\nlet me go with you i know the terrain better than anyone and i can help\nwhere is this newland\nwhy would they be different and how do you know well be safe there\nour chronicle the history of our village doesnt your village keep a chronicle\nthen how do you teach your children their history who their ancestors were where they come from\nstories change with each person who tells them this this will always be the same our chronicle has been maintained for seventeen generations i was only able to save the last six this shows the destruction of our village this is you and nikolai leading us to safety\none of the scrolls is gone i must have dropped it in the passageway ill go find it\nworf the chronicle is the life of our village without that past our future means nothing i must find it\nnikolai\nplease help me whereami\nwhy did you bring us here\nbut we never left the caves\nthen our home is gone\na new life\nhow can we grow when everything that made us who we are is gone\nyes\ni believe i would like to go back to my people\ni dont know\nim not sure it is a fantastic story\ni dont think i would like to live my life knowing what i know and being regarded as a madman\nthat would be disastrous it would destroy everything they believed in icant tell them the truth but i dont think i can live with a secret\ni need some time please\ncan i help you\nthere is still no response to our hails siri am attempting to scan the observation post\nsensor interference is significant but the post appears to be intact their power grid is still functioning however i am reading no life forms within the structure\ncaptain i am detecting faint power emissions from a system of caverns near the post it could be a deflector shield\ncaptain request permission to lead an away team\naye sir\nyes\nwe are brothers\nnikolai is older than i we are not alike we had many disagreements when we were growing up\nnikolai has a mind of his own he attended starfleet academy but he was unable to follow the rules

    "episode 164": "amen\naye sir\naye sir\nmost people on this colony will remember my grandmother as a healer but her abilities went beyond that she didnt just relieve pain and fight illness she knew that wellbeing is more than a healthy body her remedies often included words of advice as well as medicinal teas and often they were just as bitter tasting i will miss felisa howard very much her healing her advice and most of all the inspiration she has provided me throughout the years rest in peace nana\noh thank you deanna did you notice a strange man at the service he was in his mid thirties with longish hair\nhe threw a flower on nanas grave a camellia it was her favourite flowers he used to keep them all over the house\nit was a very personal gesture and he gave me a remarkable look well i guess i should be going back to the house there are some things i need to do its only a few minutes from here would you mind coming along\nthanks\nevery woman in the howard family has had green eyes except for my mother and me\nvery well i loved her very much i can remember her face smiling down at me and i can remember the sound of her voice and her scent but mostly i remember nana who raised me after my mother died\nits a family heirloom its been in the howard clan for generations its supposed to symbolise the enduring howard spirit wherever they may go the shining light to guide them through their fortune nana always kept it lit i remember sitting here listening to ghost stories with only the candle burning\ni think i will\nyou dont have to leave\nthanks\nwhos there\nwhat the hell are you doing get out of my house\nhow do you know who i am\nnana never mentioned you\nwhy\nlook mister quint i dont know what your relationship was with my grandmother but this is my house now and these are my things\nthis is a family heirloom and i intend to keep it now would you please get out of my house now\nget out\nyou wouldnt believe what ive been reading about in my grandmothers journals you know she had a lover can you believe that nana was a hundred years old\ni certainly hope so after all i hope i can find a handsome young man in his thirties when i pass the century mark\nyes according to these journals his name is ronin and hes thirty four years old they met just after my great grandmothers death and i think i saw him at the funeral a handsome young man tossed a camellia onto her grave but the strange thing is she never mentioned him in her letters never once and yet it appears they spent almost all their time together its as if she led an entire life that i knew nothing about\nthank you\nnot exactly i was in bed but there was nt another person in my dream it was more like a presence\na pair of hands they were moving across my skin\nyes and there was a voice a man he whispered my name it was as if i knew him or more like he knew me he knew exactly how i liked to be touched it was the most physical dream ive ever had the sensations were very real and extremely arousing\ni did fall asleep reading a particularly erotic chapter in my grandmothers journal she wrote very detailed descriptions of her experiences with ronin\nyou know i think he had a ring on one of his hands when he touched my shoulder my neck i wonder if ill have another dream tonight\nnon edits okay look im sorry we got off to a bad start yesterday ive been reading my grandmothers journals and i know how much you meant to her\nned your e welcome to stay at the house after ive gone i need someone to take care of the place\nwhy\nhaunted\nwhy not\nned the weather systems control is malfunctioning the enterprise is trying to repair it\ni think your imagination is\nwhos there nedis that you hello i know somebodys here so i suggest you\nall right now thats it if you dont show yourself right now i am calling the enterprise and there will be ten security guards here within thirty seconds\nwho are you\nno that was a dream im calling the enterprise\nyes whats whats happening to me right now i feel so strange\nare you ronin\nwho are you\ni dont believe in\nyour e telling me that your e an eight hundred year old ghost\nand now youre here on cal dos two hundred light years away\ni dont believe you\nwhats whats happening to me\ni dont understand stop it\ncome in\nno i think ill skip it today im exhausted\nnot exactly\nnot at all\ndeanna\nim not seeing anybody i met someone thats all\nall right i metron in\nhe sun like anyone ive ever met before i know this sounds crazy but i have never known anyone who was so\nexactly i can see why nana fell in love with him this sounds very strange doesnt it\nthankyou for your concern but i think i know what im doing besides i didnt say i was in love with him im just intrigued\ni think you d better take a look at this\ndata you said there was a plasma discharge from the console when quint was killed\nwell that wasnt what killed him im detecting an anomalous energy residual throughout his body right down to the cellular level whatever it is it wasnt the result of a plasma discharge\ngovernor with your permission id like to take the body back to the ship to run further tests\nensign ask doctors el ar run a bio spectral analysis\nnoi have some things i need to attend to\nronin ive got to talk to you are you here\nyes but i must talk to you theres been an accident\nwhy did it happen what was he doing\nronin ive got to know quint s dead\nronin\nhelp you\nquint said you lived in the candle is that true\nthe candles on the ship ill go get it\nhow\nand when the candles lit then what happens\ncomputer secure door\nilit the candle where are you\noh yes more than anything\ni thought it was pretty self explanatory im leaving starfleet energize\ni can and i have ive decided to stay on cal dos and become a healer like my grandmother its a proud howard tradition and ive decided to uphold it energise ive resigned my commission so unless you plan on kidnapping me\nim so glad you re here i cant imagine what life was like before i met you\noh ronin i had no idea i could feel this way\ni love you\njean luc\nwhat do you want\nhes not here\njealousy doesnt suit you jean luc\ni just grew tired of the other colour dont you think it suits me\nwell this is the way i am now and this is my life ive made my decision and im not going to change my mind so please leave me alone\njean luc leave him alone\njean luc\nwe cant just leave him he might die\ni cant just let him die\nno no\ncome on come on\nno ronin stop this stop this please\nyour e not nan ananas dead leave her alone\nno it wont you ve been infusing me with the same sort of an aphasic energy that killed quint\nno your e not theres no such thing as a ghost you are some sort of an aphasic life form an aphasic energy is extremely unstable it needs an organic host in order to maintain molecular cohesion or else youll die isnt that right\ni also scanned the candle the flame is plasma based you were using it as a receptacle for yourself in order to get to me in order to merge with me you have been using men ana my entire family for centuries\nno no\ncrusher to riker will close off all the plasma conduits in the weather control system ill explain later\nyouve nowhere left to go\nkeep away from me\nsomehow he realised that one of my ancestors had a biochemistry that was compatible with his energy matrix i imagine that he took human form and seduced her like he did mei was about to be initiated into a very unusual relationship you might call it a family tradition but theresa part of me thats a little sad\nire read the entries in my grandmothers journals whatever else he might have done he made her very happy back to the episode listing star trek and related marks

reading unusually high humidity across the entire southern desert region and there is increasing cloud activity above the northern coastal area possibly the formation of a storm system\ni will run a diagnostic on the thermal regulators\nit began as a minor power fluctuations ir but the effect has spread throughout the control grid it has caused an unusual concentration of cumulonimbus activity above the colony\nthere appears to be a condensed suspension of water vapour approximately one degree celsius\ni am unable to terminate the connections ira feedback loop has formed in the transfer beam i will have to go to the substation and attempt to correct the problem from there\ni have analysed the control module in the primary weather control grid it appears the station is experiencing a systemwide power failure\nexcuse me sir you are dismantling the primary power conduit i must ask you to stop\nhe is dead\nin the meantime governor you should expect the weather problems to continue\nthat is correct\ni can not identify the energy residual however it appears to have the same an aphasic signature as the power fluctuations we observed from the weather control system\nit is possible\ncaptain geordi and i have detected an energy residual with the same an aphasic signature as the one we found on ned quint s body\napproximately seventeen kilometres from the centre of the colony sir it is coming from the cemetery\naye sir\nthe energy readings appear to be originating approximately two metres below the surface i believe they are concentrated within this burial site\ndata to picard\ncaptain we have located the source of the energy residual it appears to be concentrated within felisa howards coffin\ni am reading definite signs of an aphasic energy in her body it appears to extend to the cellular level\ni suggest we run a deep tissues can to look for any signs of\nbeverly its all right have trust in me\ngovernor did you know you had a power fluctuation in your weather control system\ni cant isolate the exact source but the fluctuation seems to be originating from one of the substations that regulates atmospheric humidity for the colony\nno not yet but power distribution patterns are already off by five percent\ndata lets see if we can correct this ill check out the colony s climatic flow array\ndont worry governor well keep you dry\ncaptain i suggest we set up a power transfer between the enterprise and the weather substations try to give them enough power to stabilise the storm\nthis is impossible the backup systems should have\nfrom what i can tell he was trying to shut down the entire weather control system he was pulling out the primary plasma conduit thats probably what caused the plasma discharge that killed him\nits going to take us some time to get the system back online id say we need another day at least\nanything\nthen its possible that whatever caused the weather malfunctions also killed quint\nwe should scan the colony for any energy readings that match this an aphasic signature\nthe energy readings are coming from this direction but i cant get an exact location ill try narrowing the scan field\ncaptain wed like permission to exhume the body\nlaforge to enterprise were ready down here\nthats impossible she was nt anywhere near the weather station when quint was killed she died of natural causes\nand so now we commit her body to the ground earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust insure and certain hope that her memory will be kept alive within us all\nhow long do you plan on staying\nwell as you know cal dos is one of the first terraforming projects of the federation our weather controls and fusion systems are nearly a century old i wouldnt mind having a starship engineer take a look at them perhaps give us a few upgrades may be in exchange for a tour of the colony and a home cooked meal\nexcellent\nthat was the intent the cornerstone of every building in town was brought from edinburgh glasgow aberdeen the founders wanted everyone to feel they had a piece of the real thing here they didnt want to just imitate scotland they wanted to recreate it\nsomething about the culture the heritage when i was a boy my family visited glamis castle in scotland as i looked out across the highlands i felt as if i had come home\nwe ve been having a few tremors over the past couple of months could you check the seismic stabilisers\nyou cant imagine what its like trying to enjoy afternoon tea while the earth is shaking\nno our weather controls been working perfectly for the last twenty two years\nis this going to be a problem\na storm its the middle of summer we dont have rain at this time of year\ni certainly hope so theresa caber toss scheduled for tomorrow afternoon id hate to see it spoiled by an unexpected downpour\nyou know captain i moved to this colony because it was are creation of scotland but i must admit its getting to be a little too realistic\nanother power fluctuation\ni knew ned quint he was an honest man he mostly kept to himself i dont know why he d try something like that\nof course doctor\nyour e not going to run the tests yourself\nyes doctor\na few more hours why\nwell we are due at starbase six two one tomorrow morning but we could delay for a few days yes im sure we could find the time\ni would enjoy that tour cal dos colony is a most impressive accomplishment i actually feel as if im in the scottish highlands\ntell me governor im curious your e obviously not scots yourself what was it that drew you here\nit would seem the howard women have exceptionally vigorous libido s\nthirties\nwell it looks like were going to be on cal dos for a few days more this will be a good opportunity to get your grandmothers affairs in order\nthirties\non screen\nbridge to engineering mister data were reading\nan extremely large storm system over the cal dos colony\ni thought that the weather control malfunction was not severe\nmake it so\nwhat the hell is going on\nfog\nmister data disengage the power transfer\nmake it so\nin the meantime i think ill go get my jacket\nbeverly what the hell is this\nbelay that order\nbeverly you cant just resign\ndo you think this ronin could be exerting some sort of influence over her that its because of him that she s staying\nthis is a rash decision ill considered its not like beverly at all\ncome\nwhere\ndata i want you to go down to the cemetery see if you can pinpoint the source\nin the meantime i would like to meet with this ronin\nbeverly\nsorry i startled you i knocked but there was no answer the door was open i hope you dont mind\nwell id hoped to meet your new friend ronin\nwell perhaps i could wait if you dont mind im really anxious to meet this remarkable young man who swept away not just one but two of the howard women\nhave you changed the colour of your eyes\ni think that i preferred your eyes the way they were before i think i preferred you the way you were before beverly\noh no theres some things wrong here now beverly this is more than just an obsessive love affair that has got out of hand tell me why is it that no one has seen this ronin except you\nso your eron in its a pleasure to meet you where are you from\nhow long have you been on cal dos\ngo ahead data\nwhy not what are you afraid of\ndata ask governor maturin s permission to exhume the body picard out\ngoon i wouldnt be surprised if he doesnt know who you are hell probably have the same questions that i do how did you get here what ship did you come on\nwhy dont you answer my questions what ship id like to look at the passenger list where have you been living here whats your position who are your neighbours\ncome on beverly we ve got to get out of here\nim all right beverly go after him go to the cemetery\ni would na be so high and mighty with me beverly howard crusher ive spent more time here in the past five years than ye have in the past twenty\nim ned quint i

grandmother\nthat candle has been a curse on your family for generations if ye have a lick of sense youll listen to me right now and do away with it now give it to me\nhoward women always the same stubborn fools i wash my hands of it now you stay on in this house and you keep that damned candle ill not be responsible for what happens\nyou probably want to be alone ill leave\naye she was a grand lady youll not see many more like her you have your grandmothers fire thats for sure\nthats verra kind of you lass but ill neer set foot in that house again and i recommend that you dinna either\nlike

dinna go to that hoose or before you know it theyll be burying another howard in this cemetery\nno get away from me you dinna understand hes trying to kill us all\nthats one hell of a thunderstorm\nit just sort of rolled in onus sir\nweve traced the problem to the power transfer beam theres some sort of feedback coming from one of the colony s weather substations\nunderstood\nbeverly\nbeverly

and intimate way i warned her that it was all very sudden but she didnt want to talk about it so i let her alone i sensed that she was holding something back that she was nt telling me the whole truth\nits possible but she may really believe shes in love with him\ni agree but she does have the right to make that choice even if we dont feel its a good one\nhow so\ncaptain i am detecting

you tell i was bluffing\ngoodnight\nhe didnt like the fact that you knew something he didnt\nit depends on what kind of a guy he is\ncome in\ncommander\nive got to get some sleep so i can be sharp tomorrow\ngoodnight\nshe must have left on that shuttle theres no other explanation\ntoward cardassian space thats what im worried about oh theres one other thing i noticed the shuttle was damaged\nwell dont you care whats happened to her\nwell we can at least tell each other what we know do you two know something\ni cant believe this were friends\nokay i understand id better get going ive got duty in half an hour captains log stardate 475667 we have reached the coordinates in federation space where ensigns it os escape pod was to have rendezvoused with us however we have been waiting for over thirty hours and as yet there is no sign of her\nwe completed a long range scan of the area sir the escape pod doesnt seem to be out there\nsir it would help if i knew what kind of life signs to look for\nyes sir\ni just got promoted\nthanks it just dont feel right for all i know she was going to get the promotion instead of me\ndont worry about its am\nits a time honoured strategy tauri k\nexcuse me doctor\nactually i just wanted to tell you that ensign reilly s condition is showing improvement but thank you\nit sounds wonderful\nfine i think\nim sure its nothing but he seems preoccupied lately last night he had to cancel our date\nhes been putting together a research proposal hes been really busy with it\ni just wonder\nive never met anyone like andrew its as though weve known each other forever\nbut i know that in the beginning of a romance its possible to be a little blind\nwell cancelling a date like that the way hes been so distant lately doctor do you think those could be warning signs that he s losing interest\nmay be so\nyour e right\nexcept of course that hell have to deal with lieutenant ogawa\nall right doctor\nwhat are you doing here\ndo you have any idea whats going on\nid better go\nyes sir\ni understand\nno doctor crusher just asked me to help her with the laboratory schedule\nhe had to do a double shift\nwhat did you say\nyou know sam maybe you shouldnt try so hard with riker it doesnt matter whether he likes you as long as he respects you\nsee you later\nyou wanted to see me doctor\nthank you doctor i appreciate that\nthats nice of you to say i feel the same way\nsomeone told you\nwe were going to keep it a secret until the promotions are announced\nhe asked me to marry him\nsam can we talk about something else\nof course\nsam please\nim not allowed to talk about it\ncongratulations\nshe would have been happy for you sam\nwere proud of you sam\nhelm change course for the ar gay a system maximum warp\nive just

me\nbridge you area certified pilot ensign\nhow long have you served onboard the enterprise ensign\ni see i understand that you ve been recommended for the ops position do you think your e up to it\nim not so sure im concerned about your record\nthe incident that you were involved in at the academy\nit doesnt matter how long ago it was ensign would you do something like that again\na daredevil stunt i would certainly hope not what concerns me is that you participated in a cover up that impeded an official investigation into the death of a cadet\nyes you should but you didnt instead you joined with the others to pretended that was simply an accident now what do you think that tells me about your character\nwell im really very sorry you didnt enjoy your time at the academy ensign as far as im concerned you should have been expelled for what you did quite frankly i dont know how you made it on board this ship your e dismissed\nif youre looking for a more lenient commander i dont think you ll find one\nplease do\nvery well ensign i will it took courage to come here and face me after what is aid to you the other day i didnt ask you here because i was assessing your qualifications for the ops position\ni was harsh with you because i wanted to assess you for a very important mission a mission that could put you in a situation that would be far more unnerving than a dressing down by your commanding officer\njoin the senior officers in the observation lounge at oh nine hundred hours well discuss it then\nand ensign i do know why you ended up on the enterprise i asked for you i wanted to make sure that you got a fair chance to redeem yourself\nplease take a seat ensign\nthis is j or et dal he was in the escape pod that we retrieved he is a member of the cardassian military and a federation operative he has risked his life to bring us in valuable information about cardassian strategic intentions information that could very well enhance the security of bajor as well as other planets in this sector now it is absolutely imperative that we return him safely back to cardassian space\nonce the shuttle is safely past the patrol j or et will put you into an escape pod and return you back across the border\nwell be waiting here to pick you up\nensign this is obviously a very dangerous mission im not ordering you to take part in it\nvery well ensign will you report to sickbay doctor crusher will explain and ensign sito i must ask you not to discuss this mission with anyone\nmister worf prepare a probe and launch when ready\nto all starfleet personnel this is the captain it is my sad duty to inform you that a member of the crew ensign sito jaxa\nhas been lost\nin the line of duty she was the finest example of a starfleet\nofficer and a young woman of remarkable courage\nand strength of character her loss will be deeply felt by all who knew her picard out\nfletcher has more experience with propulsion systems\ni guess you re right didnt we just do crew evaluation reports\nit seems like three weeks why dont we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night commander\ncould we have two coffees please\nive been thinking about who to promote to ops\nlavelle is an obvious candidate but im also considering ensign sito\nlock phasers on target\nhelm hard to starboard\nfire phasers\nend simulation

well ill take her under consideration besides im not convinced about lavelle\nhes too eager to please hes always trying to ingratiate himself to me\ntheres your fifty and one hundred more\nwhat were not at all alike\nlooks like its just you and me you going to go another fifty\ni happen to like poker\nmay be i have been a little hard on lavelle\ni am your worst nightmare\ncome on geordi you dont have to quit just because im unbeatable\nill be there\ncome in\nyour e welcome to give it a try\nas his ship was destroyed hell be using one of our shuttles\nj or et will attempt to talk his way past

did really well during the drill\nyou reimagining things\ni guess he figured i need more practice than you do\ni only filled in a tops for a half hour but i had to degauss the main deflector dish recalibrate the navigation grid and use internal sensors to find a lost puppy\ni cant figure out why im even being considered for this assignment ima security officer\nill try not to let you down sir\nhi\nim not supposed to let anyone but the senior officers inside sickbay\nno do you\nsir\nyes sir\nseven months sir\ni do sir\nsir\nwith all due respect that was three years ago my record since then\ni can assure you sir that i would never never jeopardise lives by participating in\nsiri know i should have told the truth right from the start\nsir if you had any idea what it was like after that incident i didnt have any friends i didnt have anyone to talk to i had to take my flight test with the instructor because no one else would be my partner in a lot of ways it would have been easier to just walk away but i didnt i stuck with it doesnt that say something about my character too\nmay be\nhe said it shows i dont have character\nwhat could i say may be hes right\nhe must otherwise he would not be considering you for the ops position\nlook its getting late maybe we should all get some sleep\nbye\nyes sir\ngik tal\ni should practice first\nno\nyes sir\nyes but\nhow ami supposed to defend myself when i cant see a thing\nno its not a fair test\nwhat by taking off the blindfold\none thing i dont understand doesnt gik tal mean to the death\nsir is there really such a thing as a gik tal challenge\nal live ever wanted is to make a career for myself in starfleet i cant change what happened at the academy no one can all i can do is work hard and try to earn the respect of the people i serve with if youre not going to give me that chance then i respectfully request that you transfer me to another ship\npermission to speak freely sir\nif you didnt want me on your ship you should have said so when i was assigned to it its not your place to punish me for what i did at the academy ive worked hard here my record is exemplary if youre going to judge me judge me for what i am now\ni dont understand sir\ncan i ask what that mission is sir\nyes sir\nthank you sir\ni understand sir\nthen i volunteer sir\nim bajoran no one knows better than i do what cardassians do to their prisoners ive made my decision\nyes sir\nthe captain asked doctor crusher to make it look like j or et had mistreated me\nsiri want you to know that i really appreciate the fact that youve always had confidence in me\nill see you soon\nwhen they stop us do you want me to say anything\ncan i ask you something why are you doing this risking your life to help starfleet\ni never thought id hear a cardassian say something like that\npatrol ships moving in on our position\nyou cant really believe that what you are doing will influence the outcome of your evaluation\nconsidering the history of your planet that doesnt exactly validate what he s doing\nif youre unhappy sharing quarters with me then you should put in for a new room assignment just in case your e not promoted\nyes sir\nexcuse me sir do you have a minute\nid like you to take a look at something\nin a manner of speaking im running a computer simulation to test a new warp field configuration\nactually sir that was done deliberately as you can see this configuration has increased overall warp field integrity by seven percent\ndoctor nils diaz has been experimenting with this technique at the tana line propulsion laboratory\nhis findings have not been released yeti was able to review a preliminary report when i was at the academy\ni predict that when these findings are made public they will become a new model for warp field operation\nwith your permission sir id like to begin tests to see if the technique can be adapted to our warp drive\ni was quite thorough\nas you wish\nas a matter of fact siri do when would be a good time to discuss them\nhave you ever considered learning to lip read\nhes convinced commander riker doesnt like him\nhe doesnt even know you\nperhaps something you have in common\nthe pod is still too far away\nbio readings indicate that passengers humanoid attempting life form identification\nconfinement beams at one hundred nine percent of normal\nsir im a little puzzled why are we intentionally damaging the shuttlecraft\ni see i dont believe im familiar with that requirement\nif you wish i could reconfigure the phaser to fire a low intensity burst that would not harm the shuttles hull the test procedure would not be affected\ndo you want me to fire from this position\nthat would be consistent\nwith making it appear that this shuttle had fled an attack\nthe pattern of fire you have asked for is similar to what might result if the shuttle had fled an attacker while engaging in evasive manoeuvres\nyes sir it is indeed shall we proceed with the testing\nthat is most unlikely\nby whom\ni thought lieutenant powell was going to join us tonight\nit would be illogical for the captain to deny you a promotion for something you did as a cadet\nat this juncture the odds of my winning this hand are less than thirty nine to one if old\nwhat i find curious is that when commander laforge saw that the technique i was using was actually more efficient he seemed annoyed\ndo you think i have irreparably damaged my relationship with him\nwhat can i do for you sir\nid be pleased to sir\nbut we have to accept the fact that were not always told about everything that happens aboard ship\nwere also starfleet officers\nthe best way to remember her would be to excel in your new position\nbut carstairs is better with people considering this is a supervisory position id go with her\nthree months ago\nfine with me captain\nthe new night duty officer\nthank you\nyes dont tempt me\nwell if he s seeing someone else he should tell alyssa i mean it might hurt her now but it would be better in the long run\nreally why\nwhy assume he s doing it that to get the job\ni dont know it seems to me that you and lavelle are a lot alike\ndidnt you tell me that you took up poker so you could be the officers game at the potemkin\nbut your senior officers might have thought you were trying to ingratiate yourself i guess its lucky that they realised you were young and inexperienced and decided not to hold it against you\ngoodnight\npull up a chair\nops is a very different challenge from tactical\ni recommended you\nno siri detect no vessels in the vicinity\nsiri am detecting an object five metres in length it appears to be an escape pod\nfifty thousand kilometres\ntwenty\nwell i must say i disagree sir\nit is your decision sir but i am certain if you give ensign sito a chance to prove herself she will not disappoint you\nfold\ni do not believe he is bluffing\nflush\ndismissed ensign sito\ni also teach an advanced class i believe you may be ready to participate however before you can join the group you must pass the gik tal\nyes it is a very ancient klingon ritual it tests your knowledge of the forms of them ok bar a\nno no practise that is part of the ritual the test must be unannounced\ncan you see\ngood the gik tal has begun defend yourself\nyou must anticipate my attack\ndefend yourself\nare you listening ensign\ndefend yourself\nyou did not anticipate\nstop making excuses replace the blindfold\nvery good ensign you have passed the challenge\nit takes courage to say the test is unfair\nyou speak klingon\nno there is not but perhaps next time you are judged unfairly it will not take so many bruises for you protest\nwe have distressed the shuttle so that it appears to have been fired up on\nbe certain you understand the risk you are taking if you are captured\ngood luck\nsiri recommend we launch a probe to increase the range of our sensor sweeps\naye sir probe launched sir\nwhat\ni appreciate what you are trying to do but it is not appropriate you were her friends i was only her commanding officer",

radioactive so data was sent to recover it before it could contaminate the biosphere\nyes its a pre industrial society but the probe crashed over a hundred kilometres from the nearest settlement so data shouldnt have any contact with the bark on ians so how was the reunion\ni volunteered tonight i like to put in a little bridge time now and then stay on top of operations tactical procedures the

fragments they may provide a clue to my identity\ni believe the support structure on the anvil collapsed because some of the wood had rotted did i do something wrong garvin\nyou have told me no one from the village has ever been to the vel lorian mountains how can you be certain there are ferocious creatures there\nbut no one has actually seen one\nin either liked it nor disliked it i simply had no appetite\nwhere is your mother\nyes i do\ni do not believe that is correct\ni believe you are reasoning by analogy classifying objects and phenomena according to superficial observation rather than empirical evidence wood for example does not contain fire simply because it is combustible nor does it contain rock simply because it is heavy wood like any complex organic form is composed of thousands of different chemical compounds none of which is fire\nyes but i do not agree with tal urs assessment although i do have gaps in my memory i know that fire is not an element\ngarvin is correct you agreed on twenty\nwith an increased focal length and an achromatic objective lens this instrument will have a higher effective magnification\ngarvin with your permission i would like to begin my own investigation regarding the cause of your illness\ngiai would like you to accompany me to the village i will need some supplies\ni will use these materials to make the laboratory equipment i need to research your fathers illness\ni do not know first i must isolate the cause of the illness\nami to understand that garvin s illness has spread\ngiai think we should leave\ni am studying skin samples from gia and garvin in an attempt to isolate the cause of the illness\nyes she is also beginning to show signs of the illness\nit is a magnifying device based on your handheld instrument i have refined the design to increase the magnification level\nof course\nobjects appear approximately five hundred times their normal size as you can see the cellular damage is quite extensive however based on interstitial transparency and membrane integrity i do not believe it is an infection or any other form of communicable disease\nat the moment i am looking for a common event or experience that gia garvin and skor an might have shared that could have a causal relationship to their illness\nyes but since the illness struck all three in a relatively short period of time it is reasonable to assume the experience is recent and unusual\ni am aware of that excuse me i am also open to the possibility that i may in some way be the causal factor however since you have had a great deal of contact with me and you show no signs of the sickness i tend to discount myself as a likely candidate\ni agree\ntal uris correct you should rest i will attend to your father gia when did you begin wearing that pendant\nmay i see it this is one of the metal fragments is old tos koran\ni have coated this piece of cloth with the liquid which is used in lamps as you can see the cloth becomes luminescent when it is exposed to an energy source this pendant also appears to be an energy source\ni believe a stream of particles is emanating from the metallic pendant and hitting the cloth\nyou will see there are i can even block them\nit would appear that this container was constructed of a material which absorbs or blocks the particles coming from the metal\nno it is empirical data i believe the fragments were originally placed in this container to protect people from accidental exposure the word radioactive may be a warning about the dangerous nature of the metal\ni will continue my experiment i would like you to gather all the pieces of metal in the village and place them in this container\nof course\nif you are referring to the illness you are partially correct however it is more complex than that the metal fragment which\ni do not know\ngia\ni do not know what i am but i am not like you\nno i am not\ni do not wish to frighten you\ni understand your reaction but i do not wish to harm you you or garvin or anyone else i only wish to help to find a cure for the illness i was very close i must to continue my work but it will take time how long until s koran and the others return\nthen i must hurry\ngiai believe i have found the answer\ni believe so i tested this medicine on skin samples from your father they showed improvement so i administered this to him he is now recovering\na compound i made which will neutralise the particles that are making you ill swallow this i must administer this to everyone in the village but i do not think they will trust me after what happened to skor an\ni am afraid they will not believe you either gia is the well in the town square the only source of water for this village\nthis is very important are there any other sources of freshwater near the village\nthen i will put this compound into the well water it may be diluted but it should still have enough potency to work\ni only wish to help\ni do not know i am surprised to find myself here i thought i was on bark on four\ni had located the crashed federation probe and collected the radioactive fragments i was attempting to download the sensor logs from the probes on board computer there was a power surge i believe the surge overloaded my positronic matrix after that i have no memory until this moment it appears i had an interesting time\ncounsellor

everything is peaceful and everyone loves each other and no one ever gets sick do you think there s really a place like that\nare you all right\nfather father whats wrong\nyou have got a fever we should get him home\nwhats wrong with him\ni understand\nwhat are you going to do with all this\ndo you think you can help him\nthats not true\njayden i tried to give father his broth but he won

of medicine is it\ni could tell them\nwell\nno the nearest river is two days away\ncompound\nhe was your friend\nwe didnt know his real name so we called him jayden\nthey killed him because they were afraid of him but he saved all of us from the sickness\nthere were these pieces of metal they made everyone sick but jayden put something in the water and now everyones better\nwe buried them in the

up\nah the class reunion you saw a few old friends who had already taken the test\nwhy the past two years\ni do\ndeanna if you take the bridge officers test youll have my complete support but as first officer ill be the one judging your performance and you should know i am a pretty tough judge\nwell start tomorrow morning oh eight hundred hours\ncongratulations you just destroyed the enterprise\ndont feel bad you passed everything else diplomatic law first contact procedures bridge operations the engineering qualifications one of the toughest parts of the test\nim afraid i cant tell you that\nits the kind of a test that you ll have to take again if you want to be a bridge officer only next time the problem wont be so easy so i suggest you study upon your emergency procedures\ni dont know im afraid i cant tell you that either\nno im actually here to tell you that ive decided to cancel the rest of your test\nim cancelling the test\nyouve taken the engineering qualification three times your e no closer to passing\ndeanna this is nothing personal not everyone is cut out to be a bridge officer i dont think this is for you\nthats right there is you could spend the next month memorising all the technical manuals in the computer i still dont think you d pass the test\nthere is a solution\ni cant as much as i care about you my first duty is to the ship i can not let any bridge officer serve whos not qualified im sorry\nend simulation something told me you wouldnt let this go congratulations you passed\nthats right\nyou did exactly what you had to do you considered all your options you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice come on lets get out of here commander\nyou d remember him he would have appeared very strange pale skin gold eyes\nwhere is he\nyour e saying he s dead\nwhat happened to these pieces of metal\ndata\nwe could be am him and the probe fragments right onto the ship no one would know\nwe dont know much about what happened either apparently you saved an entire village from radiation poisoning\nyou iceman where d you find this\njayden huh the metal is slightly warm\nits obviously been tempered and milled the lustrous quality of the metal is so pure this wasnt made in any forge ive ever seen will you sell them\nthe metals malleable enough to make some jewellry\nill give you twenty dora ks for half the lot\nwe need a lever\nyour e getting old garvin i offered you fifteen for the metal and ive given it to you no more\nstay out of this iceman your memory is not very reliable\nthere he is its his fault none of us were sick before he came to the village\nthats right and your e the cause\nthats it leave get out of here go back where you came from\nthere you are your e the cause of this iceman\nwhat what are you\ni saw it with my own eyes hes not a person hes some kind of creature\nwe must find him and stop him before he kills us all\ncome on\nthere he is you see its just as i said\nthis is how youve helped us by bringing this plague tried to kill us all well you wont succeed i wont let you\nremarkable set of teeth breath smells like well it doesnt have any smell actually you can close your mouth lets see heartbeat sounds a little odd but seems very regular skin feels clammy but you say you feel fine\nno headaches palpitations sluggishness indigestion\nah malnutrition you should try to eat something that will build strength and return your vitality lots of meat butter cheese that should be a start\nquite so quite so im sure my grandmother would have called our friend here a demon or spirit or some kind of monster but current scientific methodology allows us to dismiss such ridiculous superstitions and concentrate on scientific reality\nyou are a nice man\nyes you probably come from a race of people who lived in the snow and ice of the vel lorian mountains your skin and eye colouration are a result of prolonged exposure to harsh winter conditions\naside from your memory loss you do not seem to have any symptoms of any illness that i am familiar with no you are a nice man now get something to eat and a good nights rest and i will come back tomorrow to see if your memory has begun to return\nhello gia\nits perfectly understandable your people probably all have great strength it will allow them to fight off the ferocious creatures that live in the vel lorian

are always there yes jayden\noh\nthat will be enough for now jayden as i told you earlier our friend jayden here has lost much of his memory so i wouldnt put too much faith in any of his ideas now that will be all for today i will see you tomorrow be sure to practice your spelling and arithmetic tonight\ni suspect he i dont know iven ever encountered anything like this before these lesions look like burn marks the fluids of his body have overheated that would explain the fever and the burning skin keep him cool let plenty of fresh air into the house and i want you to give him these herbs that will bring his fluidic temperature down and allow this to pass\ni will come back tomorrow and check on you\njayden what are you doing\ngia\nwhat is that\nmay i\nhow strong is the magnification\ni see\nwell theyve all lived here in the village for many years im sure they have many common experiences\nactually jayden encountering you has been the most unusual experience that theyve all shared recently\nstill it has to be more than just a coincidence that shortly after you arrived people started to become ill\nyou have a fever you should be in bed\nbut where is this pattern of light coming from\ni dont see any particles coming from the pendant\nits a trick\nall right lets say for the moment that your e right that there are invisible particles coming from the metal what should we do\nall right but when i return i want a more thorough explanation of all this and i want to examine your data in detail\nlet him rest for now you should rest as well exerting yourself will only make you sicker ill be back\nthankyou i was just reporting in i didnt expect to find anyone up except data\nisnt bark on four inhabited\nfine it was good to see some old friends id lost touch with most of them its interesting to see the different paths some of their lives have taken beverly you dont usually stand a watch on the bridge even when datas not here\nmay i ask you a personal question why did you decide to become a commander i mean you didnt need the rank in order to be chief medical officer so why put yourself through all the extra work\nis something wrong\nbut he s not responding\nis that supposed to be a question\nbecause if youre asking me if i liked what you were playing then the answer is yes\nyou know this is a much better way of communicating for you its far less confusing than the way you normally speak\nim glad to be of service\nactually i wanted to ask your opinion about something ive been thinking about taking the bridge officers test and becoming a full commander\na lot of things working on the personnel review last month talking with beverly about her experiences going to my class reunion\nall right i admit it was a catalyst but i can honestly say that ive been thinking about this off and on over the past two years\ndo you remember when the enterprise hit that quantum filament and i was in command on the bridge\nwell when that happened i was overwhelmed but when it was over i realised that a part of me missed it not the actual disaster but the experience of being in command i felt like i was exploring a whole new side of myself not that i want to give up counselling by any means but i really would like to stretch myself a little\nand im a pretty good student\nswitch to auxiliary control\nall rights witch the empower inverter to the lateral nowait use

of a test is this\nwell how do i know what to study if you wont tell me what i did wrong\nthe secondary plasma vent has a triple redundant bypass which means that the primary access junction is routed through\ncome in would be routed through the port transducer matrix come to give me more encouragement\nwhat\nmay i ask why\nwell then ill take it four times or fourteen times or however many times are necessary for me to get it right\nwhy because im not the most technically minded person on the ship i may have trouble telling the difference between a plasma conduit and a phase inducer but theres more to being a bridge officer than memorising technical manuals\ntell me one thing is there a solution or is this simply a test of my ability to handle a no win situation\nthen give me time to find it\nmy first duty is to the ship the ship\ncomputer load bridge officers test engineering qualification section one\nrun programme\ngeordi could you repair the conduit if you went into the crawlspace\ni know that geordi could you repair the conduit\nthen do it that san order\nthats what this was all about wasnt it to see if id order someone to their death\ni knew that was part of being in command and i thought id prepared for it but when the moment came i hesitated maybe you were right may be im not cut out for this\nwell if you ll excuse me i have the bridge this watch\nthats right which means from now on you can call me sir\nthere is something wrong with one of the antimatter containment units the magnetic field is starting to fluctuate\nauxiliary control is not online we are starting to lose containment on antimatter storage unit three\nthe control system for the primary containment field is not functioning\nsir that crawl way is in a warp plasma shaft he would never

is distortion within the comets inner core i believed we experienced an intense sensor echo\ni am attempting to do so now siri have compensated for the effect sensors are reconfigured for a low

you need to know of masaka it is what she is go leave this place before she finds you it can be done i did it\nmasaka\ncaptain that was a cruel joke you played on me for a moment a brief moment i actually thought that woman was masaka\npitiful isnt it you wont catch me humiliating myself for a woman even if she were a queen\nshes a lazy creatures he spends most of her time sleeping the problem is what she does when she s awake\ntry to stop the sun from climbing the sky only k organo can do that and hes not here\nnow youve done it captain masaka is awake\nwell arent we the persistent one\nis anyone else so charming\ni told you she would\nwho told you that\noh yes yes legend has its he chopped him up and used his bones to make the world any wonder he doesnt like to talk about her\ni dont know hes not chasing her anymore\nstop asking me these questions i was fast enough to get away from her once i dont want her to find me again ill wind upon her sacrificial slab\nwell theres an idea better you than me\nyou must build masak as temple the queens temple that will get her attention\nyou need the sign i could give it to you so could the old man but just try getting it out of him\nif

begin again i am eager for that\ni am yours every part of me is yours\nonly masaka can hurt me iam for her alone\nso its using our ship our alloys our dna to create elements of its own culture\nno it isnt i just cant get it right do you think the wings are too big\nbut mrs nars usaid we should try to make our sculptures as realistic as possible\nflying\nexcuse me counsellor can you help me with my terminal its not working right\nsome kind of alien information has been downloaded into our computer core i dont know how its working but its reconfiguring our systems\ni was able to trace its path from the replicators to the sensor array\nthose energy readings from the comet score that sensor echo we still dont know whats inside that thing\nyeah a dispersed widefield beam might do the trick it wouldnt take long to come up with the firing parameters what do you think data\ndata whats wrong\ndo you think maybe your systems have been affected\nwhats that one\nin any case its definitely responsible for the system anomalies we ve been experiencing theyre using our sensor beam as a carrier wave to transmit information into our computers and replicators\ndata the internal structure of that thing is pretty complex and its got a repetitive node configuration which might suggest a database of some kind but it could be practically anything i dont see how you could know for sure what it is\naye sir\nlower synaptic functions are completely normal autonomous systems all checkout\nall right data whats wrong\nwell what is it\nimpulse what kind of impulse\nim going to check out your higher functions\ndata come on your e scaring me now whats going on\nwell youre going to be all right your e with me okay\nlisten im going to disconnect you whats going on\ndata\ncaptain\nthis is a micrograph of whats happened to datas positronic net no was near as i can tell these are behavioural nodes ive counted fourteen so far i think the archive is using data to create different people within its culture much in the same way it used our replicators to create artefacts\nthe archive hasnt stopped yet data s positronic net is still being transformed theres no telling how many more personalities might emerge\ncaptain theres some kind of energy pulse coming through the tractor beam\nits overriding our control systems\ncaptain this is incredible these artefacts werent beamed over here from the archive the matter here in ten forward has been transformed\nim not sure but bit by bit this ship is being transformed\nim not sure i want to find out\nokay ive locked in the targeting parameters whats the phase alignment now\ngood that ll do it im setting the yield at maximum\nlets see whats going on here\nsomething tells me wed better get out of here\nwell so far the archive has transformed about twenty percent of the ship weve lost main propulsion and weapons systems in the process\nwe have communications and limited sensor control life support seems to be unaffected\nthe stone the artefacts are made in much the same way extrapolating from the ships own alloys\nwe still havent been able to cut off that beam but i have managed to access the archive by sending an energy pulse back along their signal path if i can locate the transformation programme i might be able to control it\ni think ive found the archives transformation programme\ni think so ive isolated the programs input pathways theyre keyed to accept symbols if i input this one it should initiate the transformation process\ni hope so if this is the wrong symbol it might turn the enterprise into a big chunk of rock no way to know for sure\nin putting the symbol now\nive found it captain this is the only place in the archive where korg anos moon symbol appears by itself not linked with masak as\nive accessed the programme captain\nbegin a full sensor analysis mister data and log the findings with the federation astrophysical survey\nwhat was that\nvery well mister worf fire\nmister data what are we looking at is it a ship\nthere are no technologically advanced cultures in that system now but perhaps eighty seven million years ago there were\npossibly it accumulated those frozen gasses over time as it travelled through space\nbut the question remains why what is its purpose\nwhy do you say that mister data\ndata do you believe that you re in communication with that object\nvery well mister laforge give him a hand\nyes its possible but if that is an archive from some ancient civilisation we should allow it to do so but we must be careful mister worf will you keep an eye on the sensors if the ship is in any danger i want you to sever the connection immediately\ncome\nyes come in number one\nceremonial and deceptively primitive only an advanced technological society could have built that object out there these artefacts played a ritualistic role in that society i think\noh yes its possible and if so this is a find of most enormous significance that library seems designed to do so much more than simply store information who knows what we might learn from this\nyes this symbol seems to be of particular significance\nthe concept of the four cardinal compass directions is quite common in many different cultures\nwell perhaps the artefacts that all have this compass symbol belong to the same theme movement finding a direction travelling a path crossing a boundary\nthe ultimate boundary\nive seen this symbol everywhere too but much less prominently displayed its always in the background smaller than the others\ni have no idea\nwhat is it you want\nare you masaka\nwhat have you done to commander data\nyes\npicard to counsellor troi report to main engineering immediately\ni hat this place you come from is it a cultural archive of your species\nare there others like you there\nwho is masaka\ni would like to know masaka speak with her\nwe should confine him to quarters\ngeordi i want you to continue to scan the archive see if you can find some way to access it and in the meantime ill see what i can learn from these people inside data\nim not going to hurt you\ni need to speak with ih at do you understand i hat\nwhoever took your place wasnt afraid of masaka he seemed eager for his fate\nthen masaka is your queen\nthen should we try to keep her asleep\nwhere is he\nwhats wrong\nof what\nmasaka\npicard to bridge\nreport\nill be right there\ni wont leave you please let go of me\nyes\nid say that that is ma sakai hat referred to her as a queen and its not unusual in ceremonial cultures to find royalty symbolised by a sun\naccording to data the sun image is also a symbol for death\nthere it is again the same u shaped symbol small and insignificant almost as if its an afterthought\ninto living plant show is that possible\ni dont think we have a choice we must destroy that archive mister worf\nmake it so\ntheres so much here we could have learned i really regret losing that opportunity\nso what sour status\nso its using our ship our alloys our dna to create elements of its own culture\nwell whatever the intent that lies behind its process im not going to permit this ship to be turned into an alien city mister laforge do you have any ideas\nthats a good idea but i feel that the answer lies there with masaka we must find her access her talk to her\nhello\ntell me about masaka\ntell me how can i talk to her\nk organo who is that\ni hat\nmasaka is taking over my ship\ni want to talk with her but i understand that k organo is the only one who can do that\nan old man masak as father\nhow can i find k organo\nwhere has he gone\ni hat if she s looking for a sacrifice she can take me perhaps then shell stop looking for you\nvery well what do we do\nvery well how do i do that\ngive me the sign\ni hat the sign give it to me\nyes\nmasaka show yourself i will go with you\ni need your help i need the sign for the temple for masak as temple\na line as the unending horizon a curve as a line as the unending horizon a curve\nthank you\nare all the others dead did masaka kill them\nany progress mister laforge\nwill it accept the symbol for masak as temple\ni hat risked his life to show me that symbol and masaka killed him for doing it i think we have to risk it\ncommander riker were ready\nthis would seem that this is masak as temple\ni hat said that if we created the temple then it would get her attention it may be some time before she shows herself\ni dont know\nthis is the first time ive seen these two symbols paired that could be significant look there it is again and again and there again this is obviously an important pairing he isnt chasing her anymore\ni hat said that someone named k organo isnt chasing masaka anymore and the old man said he pursues her no longer in a sense this small symbol might be seen to be chasing masaka\nthat smaller symbol could represent k organo both i hat and the old man said that k organo was the only one who could control masaka many ritualistic cultures incorporate the idea of balance into their belief systems now masaka is a queen a powerful godlike figure its not unrealistic to believe that she might have a counterpart a consort look around see if you can find that horn like symbol anywhere else troi\nmaybe its simpler than that may be their relationship is more like the sun and the moon\nexactly like two powerful rulers changing places in a continuous cycle\nif we can find k organo in the archive and bring him out then perhaps he could force masaka to leave\ni hat and the others didnt seem to be frightened of k organo\nmasaka\nmasaka i am captain jean luc picard of the federation\nplease hear us your archive is destroying\nthen we will have to find someone too whom she will listen\nall right mister laforge i want you to access the transformation programme and when your e ready input the symbol\nin one sense k organo is masak as nemesis whatever this symbol represents it could be for usa means to control her now if anyone has a better idea id be happy to entertain it\ninitiate the transformation\nyou know we could be going about this all the wrong way this is a very ritualistic culture based on symbol and myth perhaps we should try to confront them on those terms if i could somehow incorporate myself in their ritual then perhaps masaka would listen to me\nim really not certain but there are similarities between this culture and others that ive studied i would imagine im just going to improvise mister worf whats our status\nmasaka\nare you surprised to see me\nyou should know that is impossible\ndo you want to be the prey forever\nbut without me you are not complete i know you so well you live for the chase as doi will you not miss being the hunter pursuing me forcing me from the sky so that you can rise again\ni think that you are beginning to tire it is difficult brightening the sky forever\nso that you can wake with the dawn and begin the hunt again\nasami\nacknowledged number one mister data are you all right\nim afraid that will take some time to explain captains log stardate 476184 commander laforge has managed to disable the alien transformation programme starfleet has dispatched an archaeological team to study the archive further\nbut i dont understand i thought all the alien artefacts had disappeared from the enterprise\na memento\ni can imagine

you correct for it\nthese symbols dont match anything in the federation linguistic banks\nhow did it get in\nthe sensors they ve been scanning that comet for the past eighteen hours\nmaybe its about time we found out could we use the phasers to meltdown the shell of the comet\nhow\nwhat do you think they mean\nthats older than the comet itself could someone from the dar say system have built it\nwhy would they want to hide something like that inside a comet\ndo you think its just trying to make contact with us\ncaptain\nweve confined the system corruption it wont be spreading any further but we still have alien symbols floating around on our computer this is quite a collection youve assembled ive seen these things all over the ship they all look the same primitive and nonfunctional\ndo you think data could be right could we have stumbled across some sort of alien library\ni keep seeing this design\nwhat do you think it means\nthe words that data recognised in the computer boundary border road they were all arranged in this design\nand death one of the symbols was death\nwhat do you think it represents\nthe archive just activated some kind of tractor beam sir

look perfect\nshes right it is important that you be able to make the clay take the shape you want it to have but your e not supposed to be concentrating on technique today im here to help you focus on the feelings you want to convey with your sculpture for instance what do you think about when you see a bird\nfine so make your sculpture make me think of flying too\nhow sit going data\nim sure they are data you obviously dont have a trouble with realism but your e here to work on your imagination maybe you should try something a little more abstract here i want you to start a new piece id like you to sculpt music\nwell think of the effects that sounds have on people the images that music brings to your mind and then give it a form\nits a start\nmore like falling techniques last time we did that i was sore for a week\ni have no idea ive never seen it before\nits not quite his style\nthats an interesting thought\nthats nice data this is amazing how did you come up with this\nthats an understatement\ndata have you been in my quarters\nsomebody left an object in my room some kind of artefact and it has something very similar to this and you dont know anything about it\nas a result data s real personality has been completely buried in a sense data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities\nwhos this\nyou said the personalities inside data were in awe of her even terrified\nwhat are we being transformed into\nbut why is this happening what does the archive hope to accomplish\nthe question is can we trust a personality from an alien archive that seems benton taking us over\ncaptain take a look at this\nsir\nanimals are worshipped in many cultures\nthe sun chasing an animal\nand like the sun and the moon only one of them can be in ascendance at any given time\nsir\nwe have no way idea what the result would be the symbol might generate anything from korg anos temple tok organo himself\ncaptain we know so little about this culture and even less about k organo how would you convince masaka that your e him\ncaptain phasers are set for wide dispersal ten percent maximum power the beam will automatically terminate once the comet score is reached\nphasers have terminated\naye sir\nwe have been receiving reports from the rest of the ship part of deck twelve is now an aqueduct\nsir our weapon control systems are inoperative however we could reconfigure a photon torpedo for manual launch\nless than point seven percent\nsir the onboard power systems are not functioning\nengineering to bridge emergency transport two to beam out\ncaptain the entire deck has been cleared of personnel we may proceed\nthere is no one else here\nhow will she do that\nthe symbol suggests antlers of some kind horns maybe it is meant to represent an animal\nbut now it appears as though masak as sun is chasing it\ni see masaka and k organo switching positions the sun setting and the moon rising\nbut would we be any better off with him\nshe will not even listen to us\ni estimate we have less than two hours before there is nothing left of the ship at least nothing we can recognise",

did he seem then\nin my years as a starship captain ive had to notify many parents of the loss of loved ones but never before a suicide i would like to be able to offer lieutenant kwan s parents some explanation of what happened to try to help them make sense of this\ni would like the two of you to piece together a picture of his last few days\nyour e authorised to do so\ngo ahead\nmister laforge picard\nacknowledged\ndo you remember anything else\nclearly this was much more than an empathic echo it seems that you were actually seeing something that happened in the control room eight years ago\nwell putting that on one side for the moment lets assume that by some unexplained phenomenon you witnessed an event that occurred to lieutenant kwan those faces that you saw did you recognise any of them\nthere was a woman who was frightened and then you saw her again laughing presumably at lieutenant kwan\ncounsellor i want you to look through the personnel files of utopia planitia see if you can recognise any of those faces\nvery well counsellor\nwhat else have you found out\nthats right i was sorry to hear what happened\ni worked all over the ship in fact i remember running a power conduit right behind this wall here\nit was a long time ago people were working all over the place\nim sorry i dont\nhow do you mean\nno nothing like that the way i remember it things went pretty smoothly whats this all about if you dont mind my asking\nim afraid i dont\nive heard that\nof course\ncounsellor\ni dont understand lieutenant worf said you wanted to talk to me about something\nhe said he had to go somewhere\nyou know what you have to do\nriker to bridge weve almost reached the nacelle tube\nwhat happened\nsee if you can help shut down the plasma flow\ndan its me its will riker i was here yesterday remember\nwhatever happened we can talk about it i want to help\ni just want to see your face thats all so we can talk\ndanno\ntell me what happened may be i can help\na few more seconds i couldve saved his life worf\nit was strange i felt as if he didnt even recognise me although i was with him just the other day when i supervised the tube refit\nfine i complimented him on getting there fit done faster than expected he was pleased that id noticed\nhe was a good officer with a fine career ahead of him i dont understand why he wanted\nwhose emotions were they i thought you said were alone\nhow could you get an empathic impression from an empty room\nwhat do you mean\ncould his death have left some sort of empathic echo\nhow long\nthis time i want someone with you\nmister worf\ntwo til am in froth s please\nid like to think so\nim not sure yet why are you interested\ni appreciate it but that really wouldnt be necessary\nis there someone in particular that your e talking about\nmister worf you sound like a man who s asking his friend if he can start dating his sister\nacknowledged\ni met with him about six weeks ago during the crew evaluation she was very positive he was looking forward to being posted to the nacelle tube\nif he made any personal logs it might be helpful to look through them\nhis mother snape an his fathers human it all looks so normal for some reason i half expected the place to be a mess\nwell he must have been in a lot of pain to do what he did it could be that the prospect of ending the pain felt like a great relief\nthis is ensign calloway isnt it\nits always hard to lose someone you care about but to lose them like this\nthis is his last entry he made it before going on duty this morning\nensign calloway that doesnt sound like a man who s planning on taking his own life\ni thought you might like to know that in his personal logs dan talked about you a great deal he loved you very much\nthats what im trying to find out i know its hard to talk right now but it would be very helpful if you could tell me a few things about him when was the last time you saw him\ndid he mention anything that had happened recently anything that might have upset him\nna rashes his superior officer in the nacelle tube\nwas he prone to mood swings or depression\nwell nape ans are partially empathic he may have inherited some of his mothers abilities\ni understand\noh i didnt see you there your e lieutenant nara arent you\nim investigating lieutenant kwan s death and i just wanted to look around\ndid you notice any change in his behaviour recently\nhow was his job performance\ndid he get along with his coworkers\nbut not all\nwhere was lieutenant kwan s station\ni dont know\ni dont know how to describe it i was suddenly overwhelmed by a flood of emotions fear rage panic and the sensations didnt seem to be coming from any person they were just there in the room\ni was\ni dont know\ni dont see how but if i went back to the nacelle tube i might get a better sense of what i experienced\ncome in hello worf\neverything ive read suggests that he was well adjusted and optimistic it just doesnt make any sense can i get you anything\nyr idian tea ive been thinking about what happened to me in the nacelle tube whether it was an empathic echo left by kwan s death\nall the ones im sure of yes\nwell when i was a young girl my grandfather used to tell me stories by the fire i would close my eyes and listen to his mind for hours on end\nmy grandfather rarely spoke he said that was for off worlders and people who didnt know any better now the only time i can remember his stories is when i go home and sit by the fireplace sometimes when im alone there its almost as if i can hear his voice inside my head\ni cant explain it but it feels real to me just like what happened in the nacelle tube\noh its all right\ncould you open this door for me\ni just want to take a quick look\nim not sure\nworf\nworf\nlets get out of here\nyes i think i do there was a tool crate on the floor it was labeled utopia planitia\neveryone was looking directly at me but it was as though i was seeing through someone elses eyes\nits possible but i dont see how it could have happened\nive never seen the woman before or the man who was with her but there was someone else there a man he was staring at me in the most peculiar way i think he had reddish hair and he did seem familiar to me but its all so hazy its like trying to remember a dream\ni dont know but something terrible happened in the rei felt it\nif only i could go back to the control room without being overwhelmed by the experience it might help me remember some detail that might be relevant\nid like to try that\nno there were literally thousands of people involved in building the enterprise\ni think i have the man who looked familiar to me may have served on board the enterprise in the last seven years so ive asked the computer to limit its search to personnel who served at utopia planitia and on the enterprise\nensign salvatore he transferred over a year ago lieutenant ziff shes in quantum mechanics thats him\ni remember now he came on board about six months ago i think he sin engineering\ndid you ever spend time in the nacelle control room while it was under construction\nwere you ever in the nacelle room at the same time as lieutenant kwan\ndo you recall if anything unusual happened there\nan altercation perhaps possibly involving lieutenant kwan\nnot at all when i was in the nacelle room i had an empathic experience\nand i saw you there do you have any idea why that might be\nlieutenant are you aware that i can sense when someone stelling the truth\nthen im sure that if you remember anything that might be relevant to our investigation youll contact me\nthank you lieutenant\nthe strange thing is i couldnt read him at all\nwell it wouldnt be much of a bluff if you knew would it the fact that i couldnt read him suggests that he has at least some telepathic ability\nthats what i dont understand even though i couldnt read his emotions i did feel that he was holding something back\nmaybe we should try to access the engineering logs from utopia planitia we might find out more about him\nit going to take about half an hour for the transmission to be completed\nit is late\na little\ngoodnight\ni think we should ill see you in the morning\nhello\nthat sounds nice but it can wait why didnt we do this a long time ago\nyes doctor\nacknowledged\nwill it completely suppress my empathic abilities\ngood morning\ndata and geordi are already in the nacelle tube are you ready\nall right\nim fine the inhibitor seems to be working have you found anything\ni dont remember seeing these during my empathic experience have they been here since the ship was built\ngeordi i remember seeing a plasma conduit right there\ncan you open it\nlieutenant nara may i ask you something the work lieutenant kwan was doing was it unusual in any way\nthank you\nsomething happened when you removed the panel theres something in there\nyes\nthat she r thats the woman i saw\nsome things not right pull up lieutenant kwan s service record i thought so he didnt arrive at the shipyard until six months after finns death i couldnt have been seeing through his eyes\nwell it had to be someone who was at least partially telepathic\nyes but not as clearly as i could see everything else his face looked like that\nso i was seeing through his eyes and finn was trying to get away from him she was afraid of him\nworf can i ask you something do you regret what happened last night\nare you sure because i dont want anything to jeopardise our friendship\nim not feeling myself maybe its the inhibitor im so used to sensing what people are feeling and now i cant\nthat might be a good idea\nill be waiting for you\ndeck eight\ncome in\nsecurity to counsellor trois quarters\nwhere is he\ntroi to worf computer where is lieutenant worf\ntake lieutenant pierce to his quarters and hold him there\nsecurity override authorisation troi delta two nine\nstop it stop it stop it\nno no\ni know what i have to do\nyour e alive your e all right\nit all seemed so real tome i cant believe that everything i experienced happened in just those few seconds\ni dont believe it was an accident i think lieutenant pierce found out the other two were having an affair he lost control and he killed them both afterwards he probably activated the plasma stream and then threw himself into it\nit may be that when lieutenant pierce was struck by the plasma stream the subspace energy present there imprinted his empathic pattern into the residue\nthats what triggered my hallucination my mind must have taken elements from my own life and then created a situation that in many ways mirrored what happened to pierce if you hadnt beenthere i would have jumped just like he did\nwell actually in my hallucination you were killed\nwell you

normally fight off the infection is dormant\nyou have one dormant gene out of a hundred thousand and i can activate that gene with a synthetic t cell let the body attack the infection naturally you should feel better in a couple of days\ngood now stay away from medical database and you stay out of the arboretum\nalyssa\noh alyssa thats wonderful how did andrew take the news\nyour temperature has dropped almost eight degrees i want to run a hypothalamic series right away\ncall doctors el ar and doctor ha copi an it looks like we ve got some sort of viral infection going on around here i want to check on lieutenant worf\nworf have you had any unusual symptoms lately headaches nausea dizziness worf worf do you hear me i going to run a full bios can i want you to lie down okay we can do this sitting up what is this worf how long have you had this on your neck it looks like its full of some bio acidic compound almost like a venom sac worf open your mouth\nno in away its mine i didnt realise it at the time but there san anomaly in your genetic chemistry that caused the synthetic t cell to mutate instead of activating one dormant gene it started activating all of them including your introns\nyou and every other member of the crew the t cell became airborne and started to spread like a virus you know reg this is a completely new disease and its traditional to classify a new disease with the name of the first diagnosed patient\nthats right how about barclays proto morphosis syndrome\nhe transformed into a spider and now he has a disease named after him\ni believe she is doing well her appetite has increased by seven percent and she is starting to engage in prenatal behaviour\ni have noticed that many humans prefer not to know in order to experience the surprise

indication he will need all the help he can get captains log stardate 476532 were performing field tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades mister worf is supervising the exercises\nthat would be inadvisable sir the asteroid field is unusually dense the enterprise is too large to safely navigate through it\ncaptain i will need a few minutes to attend to a personal matter\nit is possible that it will take several days for captain picard and me to complete our mission i would prefer to have a human present to supervise the birthing process\ni have noticed that you are the only other member of the crew whom spot seems to like\nshe is to you however there have been several injuries to other members of the crew who have attempted to care for her\na place\ni am not certain spot has escaped from my quarters on several occasions and there are twelve male felines on board i intend to run a full analysis on the kittens once they\non my way sir goodbye spot i believe you are in good hands\ncaptain the ship is not at the prearranged coordinates\ni do not know i am unable to raise them on any communication channel\ni found it sir two light years away\nthe enterprise appears to be adrift i am reading power fluctuations on all decks\nthere are life signs however sensor readings are highly distorted i am unable to identify specific life forms\nmain power is offline all systems are in standby or emergency mode there is no response from any manned station\ni can not access internal sensors from here we will have to go to the bridge\nyes sir i am able to discern over three hundred different vocal is a tions\nit is composed of reptilian dna i believe it is an epidermal layer that has been cast off during moulting\nyes sir i can not explain it there are no species aboard the enterprise that shed their skin in this fashion\nsir\nno sir\nher is in a state of ribocyaticfluxher genetic codes are being re sequenced and her cells are mutating as a result at a fundamental level sir she is no longer human\nher respiratory tissue has become capable of metabo lising both water and air and her eyes have developed nict it ating membranes i believe she is amphibian sir\nyes sir theres klingon in the wound it is saliva\nit would appear so\ni will need to run a full bio spectral analysis\nhis upper spinal column has been broken in three places\nyes sir\nyes sir however it was in its initial stages when he died captain i am picking up one thousand and eleven individual life forms within the ship all exhibit a similar genetic flux to the one we observed in counsellor troi\nmost of the life forms are scattered throughout the ship however there are several large concentrations in the arboretum and the aquatic lab\ncaptain his cranial plates have thickened by twenty percent his brain is much smaller siri do not believe he can comprehend our language\nyes sir his would seem to confirm that observation captain i believe the crew is de evolving\ni have analysed commander rikers structure a synthetic t cell has invaded his genetic codes this t cell has begun to activate his latent introns\nthey are genetic codes which are normally dormant they are evolutionary holdovers sequences of that provided key behavioural and physical characteristics millions of years ago but are no longer necessary for instance counsellor trois gill slits and other amphibious characteristics were derived from introns which still contain amphibious codes\nthat is correct in her case the has created an amphibious life form which became extinct over fifty million years ago\nyes sir i would say austral opi the cine each of these stages is another link in the evolutionary chain which stretches back to the origins of all life forms on earth because introns can include genetic material from many different species over millions of years of evolution it is possible that a wide variety of transformations is occurring among the crew\nall humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern the virus should work on nonhuman crew members in the same way they are each de evolving to earlier forms of life on their home worlds i feel i must inform you sir you have also been infected by the intron virus\naccording to my calculations within the next twelve hours you will begin to exhibit the first signs of your eventual transformation\ni believe you will also de evolve into some form of early primate possibly similar to a lemur or a pygmy marmoset\ni am uncertain we will need to run several micro cellular scans however the ships main computer has been damaged captain the computer in my quarters has an independent processing and memory storage unit it should not be affected i suggest we start from there\nit would appear that spot has had her kittens\nyes i am curious as to why spot is not caring for them\nno sir\nthese kittens were born less than twenty four hours it would appear that spots transformation took place at approximately the same time\ni believe so for some reason the intron virus was not passed on to the kittens i do not know why\nthat is true placental barrier maternal antibodies and amniotic fluid s all serve as a filtration system\nit would take further research but i believe to be effective on humanoid crew members humanoid antibodies would be necessary\nnurse ogawa has recently became pregnant\ni have traced her comm badge signal to deck seventeen section twenty one alpha\none of the warp plasma vents has failed main engineering has been abandoned there is no one there to fix the problem\ni can repair the damaged plasma vent from here\ni believe it was lieutenant barclay he appeared to be partially transformed into an arachnid\nyes sir are you all right captain\nyou may be experiencing the initial stages of your transformation early primates were often prey to larger carnivores as a result their instincts probably included a heightened sense of awareness\ncaptain i have analysed nurse ogawa s embryo it has been unaffected by the virus i believe i can use her amniotic fluid as a template for a retrovirus it would neutralise the synthetic t cell and reestablish the original genetic patterns of each host\nit will not take long to isolate the appropriate genetic material i will need to get the sickbay computer back on\nit is large approximately two hundred kilograms it is heavily armored with an exoskeleton life signs appear to be klingon\nwe can not be certain a stun setting will have any effect on him a higher setting may kill him\nthere are crew members in the corridors and other sections of the ship it would be much easier for him to capture and consume one of them than to attempt to break through a door\ncaptain what are you suggesting\nif that is true he must be trying to reach her now\nthe mating instinct is quite strong in klingon biology i am not certain what would be an effective lure\ni am extracting a blood sample from one of her sebaceous glands where the pheromones are produced i believe i can activate the pheromones with a bio activant solution\ni believe this will produce the desired effect i will use it to draw worf to a another part of the ship\ncaptain that is extremely unwise worf may be much faster than\ncomputer display progress of genetic resequencing\ncomputer increase nucleotide substitution by thirty two percent\ndata to captain picard\nthe

minute re gill go with you keep you posted\nreg wait a second here take a look at these corroded edges here it looks like something has dissolved the bulkhead and eaten right through the conduit there

security teams out hunting for worf but for some reason sensors are having a difficult time locking on to him ive called for a level two security alert do you think we should go to a level one\ni

be\nwell before i begin swinging through the ship looking for breakfast wed better find some answers how do we reverse the process\nagreed\nthey sound hungry\nit would seem the intron virus is not limited to humanoid life forms\nwhat is it\nso spot was giving birth to the kittens at the same time that she was changing into a reptilian life form\nif i remember my biology there are several natural immune systems that come into play in the mothers womb to protect the foetus from viral infections\nmaybe we could have inhibited the intron virus by using the natural antibodies in spots amniotic fluid\nthen we should locate a pregnant humanoid\nwhere is she\nthe arboretum\nim going to check the status of the warp core\ndata\nwhat was that\na spider\ni have these intense feelings of fear and panic i feel as if i were being watched i cant explain it\nin that case my instincts tell me that wed better hurry\nhow soon can you do that\nwhat was that\nworf\nset your phaser to heavy stun\nlisten to that he sounds very angry really really aggressive what do you think he wants do you think he s responding to some predatory instinct do you think he see us asprey\nthen what does he want predators use vocal is a tions to frighten other predators and to mark territory and to commence mating process a mating process counsellor troi was bitten by a klingon but not in a place that might be life threatening nowhere near a major artery or organ data look at this look at this injury this wound was never intended to give her any kind of serious harm\nis it possible that worf could see counsellor troi as his mate\nwell we cant just leave we have to stay here and protect her and we have to keep on working on the retrovirus if we could distract him if we could lure him away from her\nklingons have got a very powerful sense of smell if we could duplicate deanna s pheromones and then convince him shes no longer in sickbay that shed gone into some other part of the ship\ncan you amplify the pheromones they need to be much more powerful than deanna s actual scent\nnon ono you must go on working on the retrovirus ill go\nno time no time to argue\ndeck seventeen deck

stand fine mister riker it wont have an effect on the length of my inquiry now there are several seeming discrepancies in the captains log lets go over them one by one shall we\nyes to the best of your knowledge has the captain ever falsified a log\nright now im asking you\nyou are required to answer my questions mister riker unless your e trying to cover something up now there are several discrepancies in the captains log shall we go over them one by one\nso you are saying captain picard had no control over this vessel he handed it over to kosinski who took the entire crew to the edge of the universe\naccording to his own logs his bridge crew didnt think highly of mister kosinski s theories yet the captain allowed him to access to the engines anyway is that true laforge\none way or the other laforge picard lost control of this ship is that true\nso the answer is yes\ndo you believe the captain is emotionally and psychologically fit for command of this starship there is nothing in his history or his personality that would suggest mental lapses\nnot even the ferengi incident with his old ship the stargazer\ni would call that a mental lapse\nunauthorised\nisnt the area secured\nkid\ncaptain you are completely responsible for that boys life\nyeah\nhow did he do it i thought\nvery original captain but how did that child acquire access to a shuttlecraft\nand did this full training include discipline\nill note that in my report\nyour e an android correct\nand as an android you are programmed to tell the entire truth\nthere is a problem with this ship mister data its in the records somewhere i need your help to find it\nthis information is very cleverly hidden your captain is not what he appears to be do not forget you have loyalty to starfleet above all else\nthat is not acceptable mister data\njust how did this contaminant get aboard the ship\nmeaning captain picard has no standing procedure for this type of situation\nyou dont like me very much do you\nhow would you characterise your relationship with captain picard\neverything said here is confidential doctor you can be completely open with me\nabout how you feel serving with a man who is responsible for the death of your husband\nthen you confirm the accuracy of the log report you violated the prime directive with thee do you deliberately interfered with their laws\nall to save doctor crushers son\nare you afraid if i keep looking that ill find your e guilty\non my way sir\nsir\nadmiral ive done my best to be thorough during this investigation\ni couldnt find what you asked siri spoke to officer after officer at length i pried into the ships log reports and yet i could find nothing wrong except perhaps a casual familiarity among the bridge crew but mostly that comes from a sense of teamwork and the feeling of family im sorry siri did my best\nyes sir captain picard my tour in the inspector general s office will be up in six months when im finished this is where id like to serve sir\nsomething i can help you with mister rem mick\ni dont know geordi but im going to find out right now\ncaptain may i speak frankly\nas first officer i should be informed i should know

and drawn out series of negotiations regarding the final status of our border with the cardassians these will be the official boundaries\nyoull notice a demilitarised zone has also been created along the border neither side will be permitted to place military outposts conduct fleet exercises or station warships anywhere in the demilitarised area\nthis agreement is far from perfect neither side got everything they wanted but every side got something and as someone once said diplomacy is the art of the possible those colonies finding themselves on the wrong side of the border will have to be moved\nit wont be easy but its a reasonable price to pay for peace your mission will be to evacuate the colony on d or van five\nyes they ve been there for about twenty years theyve established a village in a small valley on the southern continent is something wrong\ni am aware of that captain\nan indian representative was included in the deliberations of the federation council his objections were noted discussed but ultimately rejected captain the indians on do rv an area nomadic group that have settled there only twenty years ago and at that time they were warned that the planet was hotly disputed by the cardassians the bottom line is they never should have gone there in the first place\ni made that same argument with the federation council but it took three years to negotiate this treaty some concessions had to be made and this is one of them\nthen your orders will be to remove them by whatever means are necessary i understand your moral objections captain if you wish i can find someone else to command the enterprise for this mission\ni dont envy you this task but i do believe it is for the greater good\nand captain thankyou for making me feel welcome\nis there any indication that the tribal council will change their position in the near future\nthen i see no other choice\ncaptain i made that request two days ago the answer was no im sorry but you have your orders starfleet out\ngood\ni am trying to establish a new relationship with the admiral there has been a certain amount of tension between us in the past\nwell i am trying to get things off on a better note this time i want to make her feel at ease i want her to feel that she s welcome aboard the enterprise\nwe dont have to like her will but we have to follow her orders and maintaining this atmosphere of confrontation serves no purpose\nadmiral nec hey ev welcome aboard the enterprise\nmay i offer you some refreshment\nas a matter of fact they are i spoke with your aide commander wright well and he said that you were particularly fond of them\nplease you were saying about the cardassians\ni see\nthis border places several federation colonies in cardassian territory and some cardassian colonies in ours\nwell the colonists are not going to be happy about that some of them have been there for decades\nd or van five isnt that where the group of north american indians settled\nadmiral centuries ago these north american indians were forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands these settlers on d or van five originally left earth more than two hundred years ago in order to preserve their cultural identities\nyou see admiral there are some very disturbing historical parallels here once more theyre being asked to leave their homes because of a political decision that has been taken by a distant government\ngranted but to go to them now after twenty years later and ask them to leave what is now their home\nwhat if these indians refuse to be evacuated\nthat will not be necessary admiral\ni understand\nyou will always be welcome aboard this ship admiral\nanth war a theres very little i can do the decision about this planet was made at the very highest level of starfleet\ni understand and i respect your peoples long journey but i believe that i can help you to find a new home\nand if none of these worlds meet with your approval then well find you other choices\nthis is not true i have the deepest deal of respect for your beliefs and the meaning that they hold for your people\nand in the meantime i would like to invite you all to join us this evening on the enterprise\ni have been fascinated looking into the history and traditions of your people and i was very interested to learn that your grandfather kato wa was the man who first led the group of indians from earth initially more than two hundred years ago\nits never easy to leave ones home the safe and the familiar but there are times when the greater good demands that certain sacrifices are made im sure that was something that your grandfather understood\nwell a great deal actually my father was a strong believer in passing on the traditions and history of the family\ni hope that by the end of this matter you will no longer look at me as an adversary my family well our roots in western europe go back to the time of charlemagne\nbut in a sense thats exactly what happened wesley left the enterprise three years ago he was a boy and now hes returned a young man and that cant be easy for a mother or a son\nyes i heard about the incident with geordi\ni dont think he wants either of us to talk to him right now\nbeverly hes got to want that help if he doesnt then any efforts on our part can only push him further away hes got to work this out for himself\nanth war a i deeply regret that we have not been able to reach an agreement but and i must be blunt i can not take no for an answer this planet will be handed over to the cardassian government in accordance with the terms of the border agreement i am very sorry but you will have to leave\nthen i will be forced to remove you by whatever means are necessary\ni may regret doing it but i am not able\nim not aware of this incident or of the man you named and this happened seven hundred years ago i do not see what bearing it can have\nmister worf what is going on\nim captain jean luc picard of the enterprise\nmay i have a word with you alone\nit was my understanding that there would be no cardassian presence here for another six weeks your arrival here may have upset some very delicate negotiations\ni would be very happy to explain that to you but for now i must ask you and your men to leave immediately\nvery well complete your mission but remember this is federation territory gul eve k and until that changes these people are under my jurisdiction and i will protect them\nits a fact bear that in mind while you conduct your survey\nadmiral the indian councils is adamant they refuse to leaved or van five\nno sir\nadmiral i have every reason to believe that they will resist any attempt to remove them i strongly urge you to request an emergency session of the federation council the issue of dor van five must be reopened\nanth war a believes that i am responsible for the crimes of one of my ancestors against his people\nno of course not i respect his belief but i do not see how it can have any bearing on this mission but even so i cant help wondering if a dark chapter in my family s history is about to be repeated if those people take up arms against us then i can not foresee the consequences mister worf will you come in here for a moment\nmister worf will you begin preparations to remove the inhabitants from d or van five\ninexcusable you defied the orders of the ranking officer on the scene you put the lives of the entire away team in jeopardy and you made an already tense situation worse your actions reflect very badly on this ship and on that uniform now i want an explanation mister crusher and i want it now\nthat does not alter the fact that my orders are to\nthat decision is not yours to make cadet i dont know what has got into you lately and frankly right now i dont care but i will tell you this while you wear that uniform you will obey every order your e given and you will conform to starfleet regulations and rules of conduct is that clear\ngo ahead number one\nlet him come aboard ill see him in here\nstandby mister worf have your ship lock onto your people and beam them out of there before something happens\ngul eve k those people are federation citizens and i am sworn to protect them if your troops attack that village my security forces will respond\noh yes i do that is why we must to stop this now before its too late\neve k the last war caused massive destruction and cost millions of lives dont send our two peoples back down that same path again not like this now the future lies in your hands right now give us one last chance for peace\nbeam up the away team immediately\nanth war a i want to make absolutely sure that you understand the implications of this agreement by giving up your status as federation citizens any future request you or your people make to starfleet will go unanswered you will be on your own and under cardassian jurisdiction\nit will not be easy but with admiral nec hey evs support i think they will go along with it in the end\nwhere will you go\nwell good luck mister good luck wesley\nenergise back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc

friends you guys were all so proud of me\ni know mom i guess the truth is that i was afraid of disappointing myself i never questioned the fact that id be in starfleet but when dad said not to follow

after their departure from deep space nine\nwe are approaching kalla three\nit is difficult to say the magnesite is interfering with bio readings\nthen you are denying involvement in illegal mining activities\nwould you be willing to share your information with us\nwe could certainly provide passage off this planet in exchange for information\ngather your belongings it is time to leave\ni am detecting a vessel holding position near the third planet it is a yr idian freighter\nthe resonance signature indicates that there is magnesite o represent\nsir readings indicate that there are only

what all this equipment is here for\nl ursa bet or do you know where they are\nmay be i do\nmy personal code of conduct prohibits sharing but id consider a trade\nyou have a point\ncould you perhaps

sent me here to protect you\nit is a klingon matter it is not your concern\nrecently rumours began to circulate on the home world that an assassination attempt was going to be made on the family of mog hk urn sent me here to make sure nothing happened to worf\ni tried to contact him over subspace i was told he was not a board i decided to be am directly to the surface\nforgive me for being blunt commander but when it comes to protecting the house to which i have pledged my life i trust no one\nwe have other evidence that indicates the duras sister slurs a and bet or were behind the attack\nk urns seat on the council of course\nfirst we must to find them\nthat was months ago no one knows where they went from there\ni would worf and i have much to discuss\ni will send kurn a message telling him what happened but he will not receive it for days hes gone to the hit or a colony\ni may have been rude by human standards i meant no disrespect what is the matter worf have you been living so long among humans that you have forgotten how klingons be have\ni trust you have made your son aware of that fact as well\ngood because some day alexander may be called upon to lead the house of moghkurnhasnomaleheir he wants to make sure that alexander is preparing himself\nno but you are alone among humans it can not be easy to keep our ways\nhow are his fighting skills can he handle a bat leth\nhe must hes nearing the age of ascension\nwhat\nperhaps together you and i can find a way to spark the boys interest in his heritage\ntomorrow then\nmay i say goodnight to the boy\nis this your mother\nyou miss her a great deal dont you it must be hard for you being the only klingon your age aboard this ship\nhave you ever been to the homeworld\ni think you would like it there at your uncles house there is a lake you can swim in that is so clear you can see all the way to the bottom\nyou have cousins there they want to meet you\ni understand your e afraid you dont whether the home world is safe\nwhat happened today on the planet is frightening your e still troubled\nyou must have wanted to help us fight them off\nsomeday if you work hard you will become a warrior a klingon warrior and you will always feel safe because you will know how to defend yourself and ill tell you something else if anyone ever tries to hurt your father again you will be able to fight at his side and make sure nothing happens to him what do you think of that goodnight alexander dream well\ndid i not tell you as much\ncould not he have been lying\ncongratulations commander i did not think it would be possible to find the sisters\ni took the liberty of creating a holodeck programme\nill show you computer run programme km tar alpha one\nyou said you wished you had been able to help your father fight but you did not know how you have probably fought that battle over and over again in your mind\nlets see what happens now\ncomputer give me two klingon warriors\nsize is not the most important thing skill cunning powers of observation are the most important weapons ni to korba k to\nfreeze programme look what this kot al is doing you see his leg that will give a clue as to what his next move will be\nstand ready computer resume programme\npotajgpotajg finish him\nfreeze programme you should have killed him when you had the chance\nlook at him he did not care that you showed him mercy he was going to kill you\nif this was real hed be dead by now\nworf i am sorry about what happened i should not have gotten so angry its just that i am worried about alexander\nkurn told me that his mother actively discouraged him exploring his klingon heritage\nsomeday im sure he will appreciate you and be grateful for all that you have given him but still compared to other boys his age his fighting skills are years behind\ni thought that you might consider sending him to the training academy on og at your brother is an influential man im sure he could see to it that alexander was admitted\ni am only thinking of what is best for the boy there he would learn our way she would live like a klingon\nhow can you expect him to lead our family when all he knows is life aboard a federation starship\nthe boy is more human than klingon if he stays here he will never be a warrior he will never be able to defend our family against its enemies\nnot necessarily i would be well within my rights to invoke y anorak or\nfor the good of our house yes worf i beg of you please stop thinking of yourself it is alexander we should be considering look into your heart and do what is best for him\nkahless was determined to teach his brother a lesson because he had told a lie but morath refused to fight him and instead ran away kahless pursued him across the valleys over the mountains and down to the edge of the sea and there on the shore they fought for\nalexander it is important to tell these stories even if we already know them\nit made him look like a coward\nyour e missing the point\nhe ran because he was a coward\nno more questions these are our stories it is important for a warrior to learn how to interpret them properly\nno your head is filled with foolish human notions about the way things are you are klingon it is time you began to act like one\nlisten to me alexander when a human looks at you he does not see himself he sees a klingon\nit does you are different than everyone else aboard this ship\nit is the only way that you will ever feel as if you truly belong is to leave here and go live with your own kind i know a klingon school you could go to you would be welcome there they would teach you how to be a warrior prepare you for the rite of ascension\nafter you were there a while you would find that you wouldnt want to do anything else\nalexander you must everything depends on it\nyes on the homeworld\ni will send a message to kurn he may wish to return to the home world as well\nfather stop i am your son i am alexander\ni am your son alexander i have come to this time from forty years in the future\nlook at me when we first met you said i looked familiar\nno look closely i am your son\ni was three years old she was dying when we found her she barely managed to whisper my name and then she took my hand and placed it in yours then she died and then you howled in rage and said look upon her look upon death and always to remember and i always have\ni met a man in the cambra system he gave me a chance to change the past he had the ability to send me here to this time\ni was hoping that i would not have to that i could change things that i could change myself but i could not and now everything is going to turn out like it did before i can not let that happen\nyou will be killed because i was naive too weak to be able to protect you\ni was there is a w you murdered i was to blame\nyou dont understand i did not become a warrior i was a diplomat a peacemaker when it came my time to lead our family i thought that i could singlehandedly end the fighting between the great houses i publicly announced that the house of mo gh would be the first to end the feuding that there would be no more retribution no more revenge you tried to warn me you tried to tell me that i should not show weakness but i thought you were a foolish old man i told you that you were a relic from an earlier time and that a new era of peace was at hand but you were right my enemies saw my weakness and moved against me and unless i stop it right now that boy will see his father killed on the floor of the council chamber\ni staged the assassination attempt to try and frighten him to make him realise that he must follow the ways of the warrior if i had listened to you if i had become the warrior that you had wanted me to be you would not have died in my arms\nit is a futile struggle i can not change things\nthe boy i was has not changed\ni love you father\nwhos that\nwho are you\nactually we were hoping that you did\ndoes your personal code of conduct tell you that when your e stranded on a planet with no way off you shouldnt try to cut deals\ndont push your luck but if you get us to the duras sisters ill see what i can do\nrelease our

relatively quiet time is hall use this opportunity to visit the hatari an system there are some ancient ruins that are just being excavated\nwe could use this time to recalibrate the weapon targeting array mister worf\nvery good dismissed lieutenant could i have a word with you for a moment\ni noticed several times during the briefing that you appeared to be a bit distracted\nis everything all right\nohi see\nbut he s had so little opportunity to spend time with klingons you know the festival of ko tba valis tomorrow if he could take part in that im sure he would more fully appreciate what a rich cultural heritage he comes from there is the klingon outpost on mar ang a four im sure they ll be celebrating the festival\nthe enterprise could be there in a fraction of the time and still be back in time for the rendezvous\nmister worf stellar dynamics would like nothing better than a trip around the nebula\nhow could i forget the only man ever to win triple down da boat one of my tables\ni thought i explained that my brother had misplaced the key to the safe besides those vouchers i gave you are every bit as good as latinum\nis that what this is about your e on your way and you recalling to reserve a holo suite programme\nwhat would that be\nyes l ursa and bet or bigtalk small tips\nwell i did hear a rumour actually\noh i dont know im sure it was told to me in confidence\nhow many vouchers do you have again\ni believe the rumour was that the sisters were trying to buy some secondhand mining equipment\nthey learned of a magnesite deposit on the kalla system it belongs to the pak leds but those fools dont even know its there your er friends tried to get at it\ndont bother i voided them while we ve been talking\nwill we be holding position here until it arrives\nill let them know they can have more access to the lateral sensor grid\ngint ak\ndo you have any idea who was behind the attack\none of my officers was almost killed that makes it my concern\nwhy didnt you warn him before the attack was made\nwhy didnt you let us know about it\nwhat do you think they were after\nat one point they were at deep space nine trying to sell bili trium explosives\nmaybe we can find them weve arranged for quarters on the ship if you d like to stay\nany luck\nhave you been able to contact deep space nine\non screen quark i see you remember me\nand how could i forget that you didnt have enough latinum to cover my winnings\nnot exactly you can spend latinum just about anywhere those vouchers are only good at your bar\nactually i was hoping you could help me with something else\nim looking for some klingon friends of mine the duras sister slurs a and bet or\ndo you know where i can find them\nwhat kind of rumour\nand how much would your confidence

time passes a boy inevitably becomes a man what is not inevitable is that a man become a warrior a warrior must be forged like a sword tempered by by tempered by experience the path of the warrior begins\nalexander\nwhat is the meaning of this\ni asked you to meet me here after school i have been waiting for you\nyou forgot because you allowed yourself to be distracted by foolishness\nthere is something very important i want to discuss with you it concerns your futures it as time passes a boy inevitably becomes a man but what is not inevitable is that a man become a sword\nnoi meant warrior the path of a warrior begins with the first rite of ascension\nnono that is the second rite\nyou are approaching the age of ascension it is time for you to prepare for the ceremony\nwell your fighting skills will be tested and your knowledge of the teachings of kahless it will be challenging but i will help you prepare these are the kor to va candles they represent the fire that burns within the

out about two years ago\ni understand he was seen in the dori as cluster not too long ago\nyou dont have to thank me captain\ni trust you remember me picard because i havent forgotten you or how you murdered my son for fifteen years now ive thought about how to avenge his death but nothing i could do to you could equal what you did to me until now you thought you could hide him from me didnt you but i found out about him jason vigo is as good as dead im going to kill your son picard just like you killed mine\npicard can you hear me\ni will kill him picard and theres nothing you can do about it\nif you want me to stay and talk you d better not call for security this time how do you like your boy captain is he everything you d always hoped for\noh and how do you propose to do that picard you murdered my son\nyou were in ferengi space\nhow touching your apology is worthless tomei demand that you repay me for my loss\noh but you can picard you can pay me with your sons life\nyou dont have any choice i insist on being paid\nthis is a very special day picard fifteen years ago you took my son away from me today i will take your son away from you it will be our anniversary i wanted you to see him one last time\nwhat kind of deal\ni understand your desire to live but i want picard to see your body so there will be no doubt\nlower yours or your son dies\nshut up\nthey had no right to do that to me\nthey wont attack us with you onboard\njason vigo is in holodeck four\nexcuse me gentlemen the test results are ready if you d like to hear them your genetic code is a cross between the of your mother miranda vigo and your father jean luc picard\njean luc come in\nso what she like\nkeep in mind hes had twenty years to be angry that his father wasnt there its going to take some time to get over those feelings but i do think its possible\nmay be your e right but i think you should consider this are you doing the best thing for jason or whats easiest for you\nthat should do it lets run a level three bios can just to be sure\nlets go\nhave you had any other seizures like this before\nwhen did it first start to happen\nyou have a condition called the forrester trent syndrome its a degenerative neurological disorder very rare\nif it goes untreated it could result in paralysis even death im going to start you on an euro stabilisation regimen if were lucky it will halt the degeneration and may be reverse its effects the disease is hereditary i know your father doesnt have it was your mother prone to these seizures\nthere have been some cases reported where the disease was instigated by a random mutation ill run a micro cellular scan and see if thats what happened in the meantime i want you to try to take it easy and get some rest\ni wish i could say for certain but im not sure how hell respond to treatments\nyou know i dont think anyone is born knowing how to be a parent you just sort of figure it out as you go but the one quality that tends to be a requirement for parenthood is patience\nmaybe but why waste time blaming yourself for not having been there just be here for him now\nand be patient\nyes its about jason ive finished the micro cellular scan i was running theres something you need to know\nit appears to be an unmanned probe approximately one half metre in diameter there are no identifiable armaments\nthe beam appears to contain holographic imaging information\naye sir\ncaptain i am unable to find any information on jason vigo s current whereabouts\nno sir\nthat would significantly narrow our search the only cultivated land is on the southern continent and there are relatively few people engaged in agricultural activities\ni am detecting eight humans three are female however they are all too young to be miranda vigo\none is an infant another is elderly two are middle aged\ni am having difficulty getting a clear reading on the eighth the individual appears to be approximately two kilometres beneath the planets surface\nmale between twenty and thirty years old\naye sir\nbok took the precaution of encrypting the probes navigational systems so that we would be unable to decipher its flight path\nthose phenomena are relatively common we would need to identify at least one of them specifically in order to postulate a flight path\ncaptain incoming message from daimon birt a\nthere is a class four pulsar three light years from the nebula my calculations indicate the probe was launched in the xen dik abu system\ncaptain i have compiled all available records pertaining to jason vigo s criminal record and\nyes sir he has been charged three times with petty theft twice for disorderly conduct and several dozen times for trespassing\ni believe the charges relate to his climbing activities in the caves underneath the planets surface this is the information you requested is it not\ni do not believe so sir\ncaptain i do not believe it was meant as an attack but rather as a message\nyes sir in bz ala ferengi code which uses an alternating pattern of light and darkness\ni am attempting to do so the message reads my revenge is at hand\nbok was in direct contact with this chair for an extended period it is showing a distinctive subspace signature as a result\nthe federation abandoned its research in the field because the technology was found to be unreliable as well as energy intensive\nin theory it could operate over several light years\nif bok uses his transporter again we might be able to trace the subspace signature and locate his ship\nit is a possibility\nin order to do so we would need to tie the ships subspace field coils into the transporter system\nsir sensors are detecting a subspace carrier wave headed for the ship its signature is consistent with boks transporter\nthe transporter beam is focusing on deck nine section four\nno sir the subspace signature left by his transporter is decaying more rapidly than predicted it may not be possible to trace it\ni am tracing the transporter beam bok used to send the probe the ship is holding position approximately three hundred billion kilometres from here\nit may be possible sir but it would not be advisable\nphase dampers are in synch standing by to modulate the transport pattern\ninitiating transport sequence now\nwhats all this\naye sir\nwhat the this is a federation ship\ni realise i wasnt supposed to be spelunking that cave but dont you have something better to do\noh well i wasnt so maybe you should just beam me back where i was\nieri know him is he in trouble\nwhy would anybody want to kill me\nami\nmy mother never told me who my father was just that he was in starfleet\nshe died a few years ago\nif im not your son is this person still going to want to kill me\nin that case you wont mind my saying that i hope your e not my father\nnoi just enjoy climbing\nno they get in the way\nim between jobs right now\nwhats all this\nis it valuable\nid say you got taken\non cam or something has value if you can eat it or sell it everything else is luxury\nno thanks\nno\nmay be thats not what she wanted i think id like to go back to the surface now\nwhat is the situation with bok anyway why does he want me dead\ni cant hide forever\nhow long is this going to take\nwhere do i stay\nokay lets go\nyeah\ncome in did captain picard ask you to come talk to me\nill be all right people have wanted to kill me before\nand i have to admit i never thought i would\nim a little shaky\nbut you know what i feel better already just talking to you\nhes okay a little stiff but where are you from\ndo all the women there have eyes like yours\nfine\nmay be ill do just that\nwhat was your name again\nactually i meant your first name\nwell sandra do you think you could give me some room\ncant you can keep an eye on me from over there\ni thought you said your ship was the safest place i could be why the guards\nlook why dont you just drop me off somewhere i can watch out for myself\nive been doing it since i was fifteen\nall right all right ill stay here\nthanks but i think i can figure it out myself\nlook im sorry i appreciate what your e trying to do but captain captain father jean luc i dont know what im supposed to call you as soon as this thing with bok is over im leaving so dont you see there really isnt any point in our getting acquainted let me know as soon as you catch him all right captains log stardate 478291wevebeeninthexendi k abu system for over three hours and still no sign of bok\nno not really sometimes my handshakes but never this bad\nabout few months ago do you have any idea whats wrong with me\nnot that i know of\nnot bad\nyeah i know\nyou came all the way up here just to tell me that\nthanks that was nice of you\nlike what\nwell you know how she was see a straycat take it in see somebody cold give them your coat\nshe heard about the all children on cam or who d been orphaned from the cardassian war\ni was only ten when we went there i remember her telling me all about the boys and girls who didnt have anybody to take care of them so she got this big house practically falling apart then she started rounding up children eventually there were over forty of us there she called it a school you know she got up before dawn everyday and went to bed well after midnight in between she never stopped working she taught us all how to read and she grew vegetables in hardpan to feed us and she made sure we knew how to sing its important in a place like c amor and then one day she was attacked by two men in the street in broad daylight for the food she was carrying if shed just given it to them they probably wouldnt have hurt her but she knew how important the food was to us so they killed her\ndont be sorry for me my mother made sure that we were all tough enough to make it\nyou dont understand im not anybody you d want for a son trust me if you knew anything about me you wouldnt be trying so hard\noh really let me spell it out for you ive been in trouble since i was a teenager i lie i steal i use people im a criminal thats what your son is\nyou do\nyou do\nyeah\nmaybe we can make a deal\ntell my father you killed me put a phaser burn on my shirt and send it to him hell think im dead thats what this is about isnt it i got friends on cam or five that will make it worth your while\ndoctor crusher feel sim responding well to the treatment she thinks that the damage may be completely reversed\nyeah\ni cant i have a life back on cam or its a mess but id like to go back and straighten things out\nwell maybe next time you come back this way you can look me up\ni cant accept this\nwe managed to shut down the probes power systems so we could be amita board its not going to be easy to figure out where this thing came from\nwe ran an analysis of the probes hull from the energy signatures and particle deposits we found it looks like it travelled through adi chromic nebula was exposed to an intensive gravimetric distortion and passed within one lightyear of a class four pulsar\nbelieve it or not captain that might ve given us the fix we needed theresa nebula in the dori as cluster that matches the same particle signature we found on the probe\nim not sure he did sensors dont show any sign of an intruder\ni dont think so captain something has to generate a hologram we would have detected it\nthat device emitted a very specific energy signature im not reading anything like that\nits possible ill recalibrate the sensors to scan for low intensity transmissions just to be sure ill sweep your quarters with a resonance scanner\nwe think weve found something captain\nwe think he s using some sort of subspace transporter to beam aboard the enterprise\nin order to transport matter through subspace you have to put it into a state of quantum flux its very unstable\nthat means that the probe that exploded could have been beamed into position from some point outside sensor range\ni dont think there is\nyou know we might be able to keep a signal lock on him at all times if bok tries to be am him away we might be able to hold him here\nive got a signal lock on jason\nim on it commander rhodes\ninitiating transport now im losing his signal\nbok is reestablishing his lock on him\nthere ive aligned the field coils\ncaptain we might be able to get you over there but i dont see how were going to get you back\ntransports going to take longer than normal we have to shunt your pattern through the subspace field coils\nreport\non screen\nopen a channel this is captain jean luc picard\nisolate the bandwidth let the signal through the shields\nbok\nmister worf put a tractor be a month at probe determine if its safe to be amita board i want to know where it came from mister data see if there is any mention of a jason vigo in federation records you might start with miranda vigo she was born on new gaul about fifty years ago\nnumber one contact the ferengi government find out all you can about bok he was wearing a daimon s uniform if he s regained his rank i want to know why\ncome\nhow old is the boy now\npicard to bridge set a course for the cam or system warp five\nwill i do appreciate your not asking but i do think that you have a right to know there is a possibility that the boy is my son i was involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four years ago we met through a friend when i was onshore leave on earth it was all very romantic very intense probably because we both knew i would be leaving in two weeks and we kept in touch for awhile but we never managed to get together again\nno so either bok is wrong and im not the father or miranda decided to raise the child alone which quite frankly wouldnt surprise me she was very independent very strong willed\nbut whether he s my son or not hes in danger bok tried to kill me six years ago and i dont doubt he will try to make good his threat against the boy\nwhat about his mother\nmiranda was trained as a botanists he always used to talk about running a farm one day maybe we should concentrate on the agricultural areas\nthere can not be many non c amorites among them scan for human life signs\nwhat about males\nthats seven you said there were eight\nmale or female\nunless he were forced to\nrelay his coordinates to the transporter room have them beam him a board\nthats right im captain picard jean luc picard\nwe thought you were at risk\nare you jason vigo\nin a manner of speaking someone has made a threat against his life jason im an old friend of your mother sim here because you re in danger\nthe person who has made the threat is under the impression that you are my son\ni dont know\nmaybe we should contact her\noh im sorry jason i think its important that we find out one way or another would you be willing to permit a genetic test\ni doubt it\nwhat were you doing in the caves jason are you a seismologist\nwithout an anti grav harness\nso what do you do\ni see\noh theses are archaeological fragments that ive collected over the years this is a silvan glyph stone and this this is ago rl an prayer stick its really quite rare\nnot really only to students of archaeology such as myself though i did have to hand over a bottle of very old saurian brandy for it\nperhaps but its of value to me nonetheless\nwould you like some tea\nsomething else\ntea earl grey hot im sure this whole thing is as much a surprise to you as it is to me i really want to be honest with you jason i only knew your mother for a very short time i would have liked to have known her better it just didnt work out that way you look a lot like her you know its the eyes i think i would like to make one thing clear jason your mother never told me about you if she had i would have been part of your life\ni think it would be better if you stayed on board the enterprise until we have resolved this situation with bok\nyears ago i was forced to destroy a starship commanded by his son bok apparently feels that it would be fitting vengeance to kill my son\nof course not we are trying to locate bo know i want to confront him settle this matter\ni assure you there is no one more eager to put this behind us than i am\nwell get you some quarters\njason your being here i hope it will give us the chance to get to know each other\nunderstood\nput it on screen thankyou for taking the time to talk to us daimon\nyes it concerns daimon bok\nbut hes no longer there\ni see do you know his whereabouts now\nbut that cluster consists of more than twenty star systems\nplot a course take us out of orbit\ni think i need to talk to a parent\nim not sure that i can tell you he puts up so many barriers i have no idea what s underneath\nperhaps but surely it would be wrong to force the issue my sense is that he savery independent young man perhaps it would be best if i left him alone let him come to me if he wants to\nsecurity to captains quarters immediately\ncould it have been another hologram\nbok once used a mind control device to make me hallucinate\ngood keep me posted\nmister worf i want you to assign a security detail to jason\ni am not the target of boks threats jason is\ncriminal record\ntrespassing\nthank you mister data\ngood morning\nbecause bok appeared in my quarters last night now it might not have been him it may have been an image were investigating\nthat wouldnt be wise\nim sure you have but bok is a dangerous creature he has a starship he has technology\nyou seem to like rock climbing the holodeck can create some very challenging climbs we could go down together and i could show you how to use the programme\nperhaps we could climb together improbably not as skilled as you but im not inexperienced\nwhy didnt we detect it before\non screen is it another holographic device\na message\ncan you translate it\nhes proved that he can get to us whenever he wants why doesnt he do something\ntea earl grey hot\nits a risky game your e playing coming here next time well be ready for you why dont we settle this now\nit was self defence he fired on my ship\ni didnt know that if he d told me i would have withdrawn im sorry but there s nothing i can do to bring him back\nyou can not put a price on a life\nno\nwhat do you mean degenerative\nis he going to be all right\nive been thinking about what you said the other day and you know i think you were right i had convinced myself that jason didnt want me to reach out to him\nwell im not sure that that is going to be enough ive found out that jason has a criminal record its nothing very serious its only petty theft and so forth but i cant help feeling that if i had been part of his life then he wouldnt be so troubled now\nand be patient\nmy understanding is that such devices were impractical\nwhat range would that kind of transporter have\nis there any way we can keep bok from beaming aboard the enterprise again\nif he has the ability to be am aboard he may be able to be am someone away\nim concerned that he may try to take jason is there any way we can protect him\nmake it so computer where is jason vigo\nwould you wait outside\ni like climbing theres something about actually having your fate in your own hands\nit looks as though we may have found out how to locate boks ship this could all soon be over\ni thought it would make you feel better\njason when your mother and i parted i lost track of her completely but i would like to know more about what happened to her if you wouldnt mind telling me\nwell how did you end up on cam or its an unlikely place for a woman and child\nyes that was miranda all right\nohi see\nim so sorry\njason isnt there some way that i can be a father to you my own father and i were estranged he wanted me to stay home and tend the vineyards and i wanted to join starfleet and he died before we could come to terms with that an dive regretted that all of my life i dont want the same thing to happen to you and me\nyour e so wrong\ni know\noh yes i know all about your troubles with the cam or authorities\nit doesnt make any difference jason your e still my son and like it or not im your father i dont know what that means but it means something theres some connection\nbut one thing is clear youll never look at your hairline again in the same way\nyou wanted to see me\npicard here\nhave you been able to locate boks ship\nput it on screen\nplot a course maximum warp\nthe modifications you made to the transporter is there any way we could use a subspace transport from here to get me on to boks ship\nill take that as a yes your e with me\nwell deal with that when the time comes\nunderstood\nlower your weapons or bok is dead\nyou know as well as id obok hes not my son i know what youve done miranda vigo is his mother but i am not his father you made it appears o because your e sequenced his dna but your technique was flawed he developed a neurological disorder when my ships doctor investigated its he discovered what you had done\nthere never was a ransom all he was ever interested in was vengeance\nhes not a daimon he was stripped of command\nhe lied to you so that you would help him in his plan the enterprise is closing in on your position if you let the two of us go they wont attack you\nthey will cripple your vessel and keep you here until the ferengi authorities arrive you ve got a lot deal of explaining to do your only hope is to turn bok over to them and tell them that he deceived you\nim glad to hear it\nare you sure that you wouldnt like to stay onboard the enterprise for a few more days\ni understand\ni willi put a little something into your bag while you were packing i know you d probably have preferred a bottle of saurian brandy but thats all i could come up with\ni want you to have it\nenergise back to the episode listing star

that im interested in\nits the experience the orient express is romantic mysterious an elegant way to see exotic places and meet fascinating people do you know that one time on one trip both sigmund freud and gertrude stein just happened to be in the same car they ended up having dinner together every night\nwhy dont you take a trip yourself and find out\ndont forget the trip jean luc think about it you never know who youll meet on the orient express captains log stardate 478692 after weathering an unexpected magnasco pic storm in theme korda sector we are continuing our search for new

are approximately thirty billion kilometres from our original position\none fact is clear however the distortion was growing in strength if we had remained at our original position one point seven seconds longer the distortion would have ruptured our warp core\nperhaps the engines were activated by a random power fluctuation\nit is improbable but it is possible\nthere is another possibility\nthe sensors apparently detected a dangerous anomaly that threatened the enterprise it is possible that they triggered a safety device which caused the ship to avoid destruction\nit appears to be connected to several other systems as well including the warp control circuits\ni am not certain perhaps it came from the node itself\nit appears to be protecting itself\nthese nodes were linking the sensors to our warp control and defensive systems we believe this is why the ship jumped to warp\nit is possible that the magnasco pic storm we recently experienced had an unexpected effect on the ships systems\nas they increase it will become progressively more difficult to control the ship\nagreed all of the nodal connections intersect in holodeck three it appears to be a focal point of some kind\ncommander the holodeck appears to be in operation\ni did but it has reactivated itself and it will not disengage\nseveral different programs are running simultaneously\nno siri estimate that this scene consists of portions of seven distinct holodeck programs\ncommander i have located a large concentration of nodes behind this wall they appear to be connected directly to the holodeck s main power coupling\nthe power grid is located beneath this deck sir\ni believe we have changed direction\ncommander according to my tricorder the holodeck safeties have been disengaged his weapon could be lethal\nthe number of systems now being affected by the nodes has increased considerably sensors engines replicators propulsion they are all working together now almost independently of the main computer and the nodes link them all through the holodeck\ncommander i believe what happens on the holodeck has a direct effect on the ship when we attempted to destroy the nodes the characters on the train responded almost immediately to stop us\nthen the conductor then signalled for the train to change directions and at approximately the same time\nnot precisely geordi does the configuration of connection nodes look familiar to you\nthat is correct it would appear that the nodes are in the process of creating a rudimentary neural net\nunlikely as it may sound i believe that the enterprise may be forming an intelligence\nthis is a synaptic map of the human neocortex this is a cross section of my positronic net and this is a schematic of the connection nodes linking the ships systems i believe some sort of neural matrix is forming on the ship it is still relatively primitive but it is an intelligence nonetheless\ni believe it is an emergent property\ncomplex systems can sometimes behave in ways that are entirely unpredictable the human brain for example might be described in terms of cellular functions and neurochemical interactions but that description does not explain human consciousness a capacity that far exceeds simple neural functions consciousness is an emergent property\nexactly\nthe enterprise contains a vast database of information which is managed by a sophisticated computer this complex system gives the ship many of the characteristics of a biological organism\nyes sir i believe a self determining intelligence is emerging\ni believe the key to understanding the ships behaviour lies in the holodeck all of the connection nodes intersect at that location it is clearly some kind of processing centre\nyes sir a focal point where all the ideas and instincts of this emerging intelligence are first expressed in some form\nif you will distract these people i will attempt to de polarise the power grid\ni am ready to access the main power grid\ni can access the power grid here i will attempt to de polarise the grid by using a low frequency inversion field it may disengage the nodes without destroying them\ndata here\ni encountered a minor difficulty counsellor but it has been dealt with\ni am ready to de polarise the power grid\nacknowledged\nagreed\ndata to captain picard\nthere has been an accident on the holodeck sir has any thing happened to the enterprise\ndata to captain\nthe train has returned to normal sir our destination is new verti form city\nunderstood sir\nhow did the conductor stop the train\ni can get us there more quickly i know a shorter route\nyes if you will let me handle the controls\ndata to captain picardi have taken control of the engine room\ni will attempt to do so\ncaptain i am staging a scene from the tempest this evening for a small audience i would like for you to attend\nmiranda s first encounter with other human beings\nit seemed appropriate captain you took a substantial risk in allowing the enterprise to complete its task\nbecause the end result was unknown the object could have been dangerous it may in fact be dangerous\nyes sir\nhold it you leave these people alone theyre only trying to help\ntheyre all trying to hijack the train\ni am\ni was right he was trying to make off with my brick\nsorry its at woman game gangster\ni had to get it back you know how much its worth lady plenty and i got to get it to keystone city\nthats where everything begins gin\nthis is my stop\nexcuse me\nlaying the foundation\nnow if you ll excuse me ive got a train to catch\nsorry to spoil your party pal its nothing personal\ndont listen to him hes up to somethin\ndont do it\nnew verti form city\ni dont understand it the impulse systems suddenly cut out and the warp drive just kicked in\nim working on it\ncaptain the computers locked out all the propulsion\ncontrols i cant access any of the overrides\nif you want us to stop ill have to do an emergency core shutdown\nit wasnt me i didnt have time to complete the shutdown procedure\nonly that we seem to have more than one mystery here we still dont know why the ship jumped into warp but it looks like were lucky it did there was a theta flux distortion building up around the ship\nour sensors were never designed to detect theta flux distortions and yet there is a record of the distortion in the sensor log thats the other mystery\nif the enterprise hadnt jumped into warp when it did we would ve been blown to pieces\ni just dont get it data what would cause the engines to suddenly jump into warp\nwhich occurred justin time to save the ship\ni dont know i dont think im ready to start believing in luck\nyeah whats that\nyeah but theres no direct link between the warp engines and the sensors\nwhoa what is that its some kind of new circuit node and its connected to at least half a dozen points in the sensor array\ni guess theresa connection between the warp engines and the sensors after all\na force field where did that come from\nwell wherever it came from it sure doesnt want us messing with this node\nwe found these nodes in several systems around the ship at some level or another theyre all connected\nwhen the sensors detected danger the defensive systems reacted to the threat and activated the warp engines to protect us\nwherever they come from they seem to be multiplying\nwell getting rid of them isnt going to be so easy when we attempted to examine the circuitry of one of the nodes it generated a force field to keep us out\nwe might be able to find a way to use the holodeck circuitry to disable the nodes permanently\nweve lost engine and helm control again captain but this time they re completely burned out i dont know if we can stop the ship\nthe enterprise also took off in a new direction\nyeah yeah it looks a little like the structure of your positronic brain\nin other words something thats more than just the sum of its parts\ni dont understand it captain all of a sudden cargo bay five started to de pressurise\nyes sir and ive reestablished the containment field but im reading massive power surges in the cargo bay and all sorts of transporter activity something weird is happening there captain\naye sir\nlaforge to bridge\ni wish i could tell you\nit looks like the ships replicator and transporter systems have been merged somehow to create this the question is what is it ensign i want to run a full spectral analysis on this\nim picking up a massive power fluctuations the ship is losing its structural integrity\nlaforge to data laforge\ndata i think we ought to get together and compare notes\nim betting it all has something to do with that object thats forming in the cargo bay\nand some kind of object in the cargo bay thats being constructed atom by atom\ni have no idea its composed of silica polymers d uranium and a couple of other compounds we havent been able to identify yet but creating it has had quite an effect on our systems warp power has dropped forty seven percent\ncounsellor we havent been able to reestablish the safeties\nthe object is absorbing laforge\ni mean its generating its own energy im picking up coherent emissions\nmatter conversion its incredible wait a minute wait a minute some things wrong we ve got power fluctuations verti on absorption rate is dropping whats happening to the particle beam\ncaptain\nthe energy output of the object is decreasing\ncaptain you d better take a look at this when the particle beam cut off the object was beginning to form a coherent energy matrix now if these readings are accurate id say that the emission patterns were almost organic\ni think so\nwell its energy levels are dropping rapidly unless it gets an infusion of verti on particles and i mean soon i dont think so\ncaptain all of our systems are back online and were moving again at warp nine\ncaptain we have a problem even at warp nine the cord annas system is over twelve hours from here\nyes sir but thats not the problem the ship has diverted all of our systems to maximum propulsion including life support we have less than two hours of reserve oxygen\nwhite dwarf stars are the only natural sources of ver tions sir\nive narrowed the search to the macpherson nebula which is a supernova remnant and dik on alpha which is a class nine pulsar theyre both fairly close to our current flight path and either one could produce verti on particles if we detonated a modified photon torpedo inside it\nits really hard to say i cant even guarantee that we can create them at all\ni say go with the nebula\nyes captain we are\naye sir\nits working captain the reaction is producing verti on particles\ncaptain captains log supplemental the enterprise is back under our control all traces of the emergent intelligence are gone and the object it created has disappeared into space\ndata i can barely see\nyes but data this is a play the audience has to see you\nthere thats much better now do you want to try it again\nwell data shakespeare was witnessing the end of the renaissance and the birth of the modern era and prospero finds himself in a world where his powers are no longer needed so we see him here about to perform one final creative act before giving up his art forever\nyes but theres a certain expectancy too a hopefulness about the future you see shakespeare enjoyed mixing opposites the past and the future hope and despair data what is this is this part of your programme\nwhat is going on\na train\ncomputer end programme\ncomputer end programme\noh yes ik no will get it seen to data\nyes yes data i know about the orient express but what is it doing on prospero s island\nis it possible that this malfunction will affect the other holodeck s as well\nvery good data but shut down the other holodeck s until you refinished just to be on the safe side\ni never realised that you were interested in trains are you aware that at its peak the orient express carried more than ten thousand people a year\nwhat then\ni wonder what they talked about\npicard here\nvery good im on my way thank you\nwell lets move onto another survey region have stellar cartography begin a\nmister data report\npicard to engineering\nmister laforge whats going on weve lost primary helm control on the bridge\nmister data whats our heading\nbegin the procedure mister laforge\nwell done mister laforge\nwell i want an explanation picard\nhave you found anything yet\nwhy didnt our sensors alert us\ngeordi whats going on we just went into warp\nexplain\nand you think that the ship has somehow gone beyond those functions and is developing a new capacity\nprocessing centre\nvery well mister data mister worf i want you to go along see if you can to reestablish control of the ship without damaging the nodes if the ship is truly an emerging intelligence then we have a responsibility to treat it with the same respect as any other being\ndid everyone get out in time\ni want you to send a team down there immediately find out whats going on\npicard here whats going on\nwhat is that object\ncounsellor did you draw any other conclusions from your experiences on the holodeck anything that would help us to understand this situation\nis there any way that we can persuade them to give back control of the ship\nis there a way that we can relate to them on their own level find some way to influence their behaviour\nvery well counsellor go ahead but bear in mind that whenever we have tried to hinder their efforts weve failed perhaps its time to cooperate with them conductor\nwhats our heading\nverti on particles verti form city thats what the ship was looking for\ngeordi whats going on\npicard here\nyes weve had a ship wide shutdown weve lost attitude control and most systems are offline\nare you suggesting that the enterprise is trying to create a life form\nwill it survive\nlets get back to the bridge\npicard here\nwhats our course\nanother white dwarf star\nwill the object in the cargo bay survive that long\nmister data we have to stop the enterprise that means you have to get control of the train\nthe ship is looking for verti on particles and it believes that the cord annas system is the closest source is there any possibility of anything closer\nthen what about artificial ones can you create the particles\nwell we ve got to give it a try the nebula or the pulsar its your choice mister laforge\nvery well begin the torpedo modifications\nstandby are we within sensor range of the nebula\nmister data i need you to slow us to impulse speed\nare the modifications to the torpedoes complete\nlaunch torpedo\nthen the purpose of the ships intelligence was simply to bring this life form into being\ncome\ni would be honoured what scene\no brave new world that has such people in it\nwhy do you say that\nand i have allowed it to go off on its merry way\nthe intelligence that was formed on the enterprise didnt just come out of the ships systems it came from us from our mission records personal logs holodeck programs our fantasies now if our experiences with the enterprise have been honourable cant we trust that the sum of

make any sense\nand when the engineer tried to protect us one of the characters shot him\nare you saying the ship is under the control of the holodeck\ndata what are you suggesting\nthats true it sees with its sensors it talks with its communications systems\ni dont know how or why sir but warp power appears to be back to normal levels\nwe appear to be on a course for tambor beta six its a white dwarf star\nthe ship is using a modified tractor beam to collect verti on particles from the star\nthe particles are being routed through the transporter system into cargo bay five\nwhat do you mean\nthe beams exhausted the supply of particles in the start here s nothing left to take out\nwere heading for the cord annas system\nits the nearest one to our last position\nver tions usually occur in miniscule amounts do you think either of these phenomena could produce enough of them\nnow lets see if we can get this ship to go where we want\nthe nodes are deactivating all over the ship

new verti form city\nokay but just one of you the rest stay here\nhow could that happen\nalmost like an imagination captain id like to go to the holodeck i could interact with the characters and may be find some clues to help us understand what s happening\nno\ncan you deal me in\nis that why you killed the engineer to get this brick\nwhy what sat keystone city\nwait what happens at keystone city why are you taking the brick there\ni think we should follow that man that brick may be an important clue\nwhere did he go\nthere he is im going after him\nwhat are you doing here\nthat man said he was laying a foundation\ntroi to data\nhow are you doing\nwhats happening\nim fine\nthe ship was protecting itself again stopping us from interfering whatever its doing it intends to continue\ni think he s right captain look at the common themes playing out on the holodeck a puzzle being put together a foundation being laid a paperdoll being fashioned theyre all images of something being constructed\nthe holodeck was full of metaphoric imagery like it was having some kind of daydream it may not make literal sense but symbolically it probably does have some kind of logic to it\ni think they represent different aspects of the ship the engineer for instance may represent the navigational system the gunslinger could be the weapon system\ni dont think its possible to reason with them many of them are genuinely unaware of whats going on its as though this emergent intelligence is like an infant acting on impulse trying to figure itself out as it goes the only source of experience it can draw on is ours through our holodeck programs\nmay be there is id like to go back and try\nim aware of that\nis there anything we can do to help\nwhy dont you go with him worf well see what we can do here\nof course you need nt worry about a thing so tell me everything you know about verti form city\nyes what happened\nwhere are we going now\nlets go\nplease listen to me we understand what

he wants to go on one more mission thats what were going to do\nbut didnt q say you already had caused it\nhello worf its been a long time\nhave you had a chance to read our request\ninform

anything were heading back maximum warp\ncarry out my orders may i see you a moment\ndont you ever question my orders on the bridge of my ship again\ni understand that you would never have tolerated that kind of behaviour back on the enterprise and iwon there i dont care if youre my ex captain or my ex husband\ni know thats why ive allowed us to stay here longer and keep looking but i also want you to allow for the possibility that none of what your e saying is real\njean luci care for you too much not to tell you the truth you have advanced i rum odic syndrome its possible that all of this is in your mind ill stay here six hours longer and then were heading home i want you to remember if it were anyone but you we wouldnt even be here q\nthis is amazing the in his optic nerve sis

tenderness for a few days thats to be expected\njean luc ill be right back alyssa\nalyssa lost the baby i think its the same phenomenon that affected geordi somehow the temporal energy from the anomaly caused the foetal tissue to revert to an earlier stage of development its as if the unborn child began to grow younger until finally the itself began to break down\nphysically shes fine for now but if this temporal reversion continues i dont think any of us are going to be fine for much longer\nour cellular structures appear to be coalescing reverting to earlier forms in some cases this has caused old injuries to be healed but the effect is only temporary eventually may kill all of us\nwill how long is this thing between you and worf going to go on\ni agree i think its time to put it

laugh\ni found that a touch of grey adds an air of distinction\ncaptain how long has it been since youve seen a physician about your i rum odic syndrome\nbut sir peri daxon\nin all honesty captain the thought has occurred to me however theres nothing to disprove what your e saying so its possible something is happening to you the first thing we should do is run a complete series of neuro graphics cans we can use the equipment at the biometrics lab here on the campus jessel ask professor ripper to take over my lecture for tomorrow possibly for the rest of the week captain well get to the bottom of this\nthat would be inadvisable\nif you attempt to ignite a petroleum product on this ship at zero hundred hours it will activate the fire suppression system which would seal off this entire compartment\nexpression of what\nah then to burn the midnight oil implies late work\ni am curious what is the etymology of that idiom how did it come to be used in contemporary language\nit is good to see you too sir\ncertainly\nthis will need a completely new field induction sub processor it appears that we will be required to ignite the midnight petroleum sir\nit would appear there is a discontinuity between the time periods you described events in one time period would seem to have no effect on the other two\naye sir\ncomputer restore holographic image\nthere is another option we could arrange passage aboard a medical ship\nyes sir there was an outbreak of terrell ian plague on romulus the klingons have been allowing federation medical ships to cross the border\ndoctor\nim not sure information on the klingon political structure is hard to come by these days however at last report worf was governor of hatori a a small klingon colony near the border chilton\nhow would you define unusual sir every region of space has its own unique properties that can not be found anywhere else\nnothing sir\ngiven the fact that there is an apparent discontinuity between the three time periods the captain has visited qs statement may be accurate if confusing\nthat is true qs interest in you has always been very similar to that of a master and his beloved pet that was only an analogy captain\ncaptain there are four warbirds holding position on the romulan side of the neutral zone\nsensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead\naye sir\nwe are approaching the dev ron system captain sensors are picking up a large subspace anomaly directly ahead\naye sir\nas you can see sir theres nothing there\nstill nothing captain ive conducted a full sensor sweep out to one lightyear from the pasteur no temporal anomalies no particle fluctuations nothing\nthere are several methods of detecting temporal disturbances but were limited by the equipment on the pasteur\nhowever it may be possible to modify the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse which could scan beyond the subspace barrier\nto make the modifications and search the entire dev ron system will take approximately fourteen hours\nthe anomaly is two hundred million kilometres in diameter it is a highly focused temporal energy source which is emitting approximately the same energy output as teng type stars\ni am uncertain sir sensors are unable to penetrate the anomaly\nthat is a most intriguing ideas iri do not believe a tachyon beam was ever used in such away i had no idea you were so versed in the intricacies of temporal theory sir\ni believe we can make the necessary modifications in main engineering sir\nagreed initiating tachyon pulse\nit will take the computer some time to give us a complete picture of the anomaly s interior i suggest we\ngeordi what is wrong\ndata to sickbay medical emergency in main engineering\ncaptain i believe i have a partial explanation i have completed my analysis of the anomaly it appears to be a multiphasic temporal convergence in the spacetime continuum\nit is in essence an eruption of anti time\na relatively new concept in temporal mechanics the relationship between anti time and normal time is analogous to the relationship between antimatter and normal matter\nthey would annihilate one other causing a rupture in space i believe this is what happened in the dev ron system the rupture may be sending out waves of temporal energy which are disrupting the normal flow of time\nanti time sir picard\nthat is a fascinating hypothesis how did you formulate\ncaptain another ship de cloaking bearing two one five mark three one o hits the enterprise\ntheyre hailing us\nthe klingon ship is disengaging admiral riker is hailing us\napproximately one hour forty five minutes sir\naye sir\nour tachyon pulse has been unable to completely penetrate the anomaly if we had information on the centre of the phenomenon we might have a basis for speculation\nin theory a tomographic imaging scanner capable of multiphasic resolution would be able to penetrate this much interference the day strom institute has been working on such a device but it is still only theoretical\nyes sir\npossibly there is a great deal of interference but i am getting some readings this is very unusual\nit appears that our tachyon pulse is converging with two other tachyon pulses at the centre of the anomaly the other two pulses have the exact same amplitude modulation as our own pulse it is as if all three originated from the enterprise\ncaptain what are you suggesting\ni suspect the last thing counsellor troi would have wanted is for the two of you to be alienated\ni think i know what the captains talking about if im not mistaken hes describing a paradox\nintriguing it is possible we could ve caused the very anomaly we ve been looking for let us assume for a moment that the captain has been travelling through time let us also assume he has initiated an tachyon pulse at the same coordinates in space in all three time periods in that case it is possible that the convergence of three tachyon pulses couldve ruptured the subspace barrier and created an anti time reaction\nif we go back to the dev ron system now we might be able to see the initial formation of the anomaly\nsensors are picking up a small temporal anomaly off the port bow\nthe anomaly is being sustained by the continuing tachyon pulses in the other two time periods i suggest shutting them down\ni will investigate the options\nsir\naye sir\nno sir\naye sir disengaging\nit remains unaffected here as well sir\nit would require taking the ship into the anomaly itself once inside we may be able to use the engines to create a static warp shell\ncollapsing the anomaly and restoring the normal flow of time but this would have to be done in the other two time periods as well\ni am preparing to initiate a static warp shell\ncaptain i have an idea if we take the ship to the centre of the anomaly and create a static warp shell\nyes sir\nat least thirty seconds sir\nwe have reached the centre sir\ninitiating static warp shell now\nsomething is happening a new subspace barrier appears to be forming\ncaptain it appears to be working the anomaly is beginning to collapse i think that\nthe warp shell is definitely having an effect sir the anomaly is collapsing\nboth of the other ships have been destroyed q\nthe anomaly is nearly collapsed\ni believe however this situation is unique since the anomaly did not occur there have already been changes in the way this time line is unfolding the future we experience will undoubtedly be different from the one the captain encountered\nfive card draw deuces wild\nwould you care to deal sir\nhow is this possible\nhow is she\nits four decks down sir section zero zero five\nagreed initiating tachyon pulse\naye sir\ntheyre still moving off sir half a lightyear away\nadmiral we took a direct hit to the starboard plasma coil our cloak isnt functioning engineering reports it ll be seven hours before we can cloak again\naye sir\nentering the dev ron system sir\nweve entered the anomaly\naye sir\naye sir\nhow do you like your tea\ncourse it shot what do you want in it\nhere you go\nif youre really his friend youll get him to take that grey out of his hair looks like a bloody skunk\ncaptain picard to the bridge captain we ve got a problem with the warp core or the phase inducers or some other damn thing\nhello captain or should i call you ambassador\nhow about mister picard\ni dont think i could get used to that\nnine years\nclose to twenty five years\ni a little too good to me in some places can i give you a hand here\nyou ve got leaf miners you might want to use a bacillus spray my wife is quite a gardener ive picked up a little bit of it\njust wonderful busy as ever shes just been made director of the day strom institute\nsidney\nwell theyre not so little anymore brett is applying to starfleet academy next year\noh i just thought id stop by been thinking about the old days on the enterprise i was in the neighbourhood\nno\nleah s got a few friends at starfleet medical word gets around\ni know once i heard well i just wanted to stop by just the same\ncaptain are you all right captain\ncaptain whats wrong\nwhat\nwhat do you mean you ve been right here with me\nits okay captain every things going to be all right\ncaptain i think we should go back to the house and call your doctor\nwell allright all right so what do you want do about it\ndata why\nhelp how\nokay then all right lets go see data hes still at cambridge isn the\nsee who\ncome on captain lets go see data\nthank you\ndata what is it with the hair anyway\nnow come on captain no one said anything of the kind\nperhaps the anomaly is a temporal disturbance of some kind\ncaptain\ncaptain wake up\nthe neutral zone\ndata s arranged for us to run those tests on you in the biometrics lab were ready to go if you are\nthe neutral zone why\ncaptain\njust because youve seen it in two other timeframes doesnt mean that its going to be here\nall right okay but first there is no neutral zone remember\nright now relations between us and the klingons arent too cosy\nwell if were going to the dev ron system were going to need a ship\ncaptain im sorry i guess all we can do now is wait and see if the yorktown finds anything\nso what we need is a medical ship\nhello doctor\nagreed what about worf\ndata isnt worf still a member of the klingon high council\nim not sure but i wouldnt try suggesting it he says he s not taking any more damn tests\ni dont believe him this has to be another one of qs games hes probably listening to us right now getting a big laugh out of watching us jump through his hoops\nwe can get more power if were route the primary taps to the deflector array\nokay the pulse is holding steady were starting to receive data from the scan\ni dont know its like somebodys sticking a nice pick in my temples my visors picking up all kinds of electromagnetic fluctuations\nim trying captain theyre too much for us i cant keep the phase inducers online\nthe warp core has been badly damaged theres a breach in progress\nthe ship has held up pretty well over the years\nmight have been tough for him then he took her death pretty hard\ni see where you re going data and because anti time operates opposite the way normal time does the effects would travel backwards through the spacetime continuum\nits an anti time eruption it seems to have been formed within the last six hours\nthe only way to stop this things to repair the rupture at the focal point where time and anti time are converging\nyeah data thats right and the shell would act as an artificial subspace barrier separating time and anti time\nauxiliary power im having trouble keeping the impulse engines online ive got power fluctuations all across the board\nim trying but theres a lot of interference\ni cant hold it the containment system is going\nwere losing containment q\ncontainment field is at critical im losing it q\nfour hands in a row how does he do it\nsure goes against everything weve heard about not polluting the timeline doesnt it\ncaptain\ni am initiating a fleet wide yellow alert starfleet intelligence has picked up some alarming reports from the romulan empire it appears that at least thirty warbirds have been pulled from other assignments and are headed for the neutral zone\nour operatives on romulus have indicated that there appears to be something happening in the neutral zone specifically in the dev ron system our own long range scans have picked up some kind of spatial anomaly in the area we cant tell what it is\nthis is a very delicate situation i am deploying fifteen starships along our side of the neutral zone i want you to go there as well see if you can find out what is going on in the dev ron system\nnot yet wait and see what the romulans do you can conduct long range scans send probes if necessary but do not cross the border unless they do\nstarfleet out\ncaptain picard to the bridge please\nsir starfleet has just issued an alert it appears a number of vessels are moving toward the neutral zone between romulan and federation space\nfreighters transports all civilians none of them starfleet ships\nstarfleet s cancelling our mission to farpoint station and ordering us to the neutral zone as soon as we leave the space dock\nthats right sir\nyou have to realise sir this isnt exactly my area of expertise the chief engineer should be making these modifications\nhow did you know that sir\nyes sir ill get right to these modifications fletcher tell munoz and lee to get up here right away\nwe have to realign the entire power grid well all be burning the midnight oil on this one\nexcuse me\nthat was just an expression\na figure of speech i was trying to tell him that wed be working late\nthats right\ni dont know sir\nwere nearing the coordinates you gave me sir\nwho sir\nengage to where sir\naye sir\napproximately four hundred million kilometres in diameter sir\nive tried everything i know there s just too much interference theres nothing on board that ll do the job\nbute havent finished the scan sir\nwhy would it be sir\ntake the ship in where sir\ncourse laid in sir\nwere entering the anomaly

date\n47988\n47988im not sure i dont know how or why but im moving back and forth through time\ni had this feeling i had physically left the enterprise i was in another time another place i was somewhere in the past\nyou see its all slipping away so fast its like waking up from a nightmare it was years ago it was before i took command of the enterprise i was talking to someone i cant remember who and then it all changed i was no longer in the past i was now an old man in the future and i was outside and i was doing something i cant remember what it was im sorry its all gone i just cant remember\nnono it was much more than a dream the smells the sounds the very touch of things much more real than a dream\nyou see i cant say at first i had a sense of confusion disorientation i wasnt sure where i was and then all that passed and it all seemed perfectly natural as though i belonged in that time but i cant\ngeordi\noh i havent been called that for some time either\nhow about jean luc\ngood lord geordi well how long has it been\nno no no since you last called me captain since we were all together on the enterprise\ntwenty five years well time has been good to you\noh well im just tying up some vines\nhow is leah\nwhat about the little ones brett al andra an der\nsidney\nso what brings you here\ngeordi you dont make the trip from rigel three to earth just to drop by\nso youve heard\nim not an invalid i rum odic syndrome can take years to run its course\nwell now that your e here you can help me carry those tools well my cooking may not be up to leah s standards but i can still make a decent cup of tea ohi read your last novel i thought that the protagonist a little too flamboyant but for the rest i\nim sorry lieutenant my mind must have wandered what were you saying\nno of course im familiar with the blueprints and specifications but this will be my first time aboard\nim sure she is\nno its just that you look very familiar\ntasha i was just with tasha in the shuttle\nactually i really like running around the ship in my bare feet\na defect that you hadnt noticed before\nif thats so why do you look like youve just signed my death sentence\ni wouldnt worry about it something tells me that your e going to have to put up with me for a long time to come\nhas worf found anything\ni wasnt dreaming something happened\ngo ahead mister worf\nbeverly mister worf will you route the call through to doctor crushers office\nadmiral\nis there any explanation why they would make such a blatantly aggressive move\nwhat are our orders\nami authorised to enter the neutral zone\nunderstood\nthis is not my time i dont belong here\ni was somewhere else a few moments ago\nnon on oi was somewhere else i was it was a long time ago there was someone talking i was talking to someone beverly i was talking to beverly\nim not senile you know this did happen i was here i was talking to you and then i was somewhere else i was on the enterprise i was back on the enterprise at least i think thats where it was i was in sickbay well it might have been a hospital\nyes yes i know what you rethinking its their um odic syndrome hes beginning to lose his mind the old man well its not that and im not daydreaming either\ndata i want to see data\nbecause i think he can help\ni dont know i dont know i want to see data\nyes i think he is\nyou see them dont you\ntheyre everywhere theyre laughing at me why are they laughing\nyes data well go see data\ni know how it sounds but it happened it was real i was there back onboard the enterprise\ntea earl grey hot\nnothing well data i must say this is a fine place you have here they certainly treat professors pretty well at cambridge\nyou say this is earl grey id swear that it was darjeeling\na week theyve prescribed peri daxon\nyes i know its not a cure theres nothing that can prevent the deterioration of the synaptic pathways you think that im senile that all this is just a delusion\nthats the data that i remember i knew i could count on you\nto captain jean lucpicardstardate41148\nyou are hereby requested and required to take command\nto take command of the enterprise as of this date signed rear admiral norah satie starfleet command\nred alert all crew to battlestations\nreport\nnoted counsellor do you sense anything unusual onboard the enterprise perhaps an alien presence that doesnt belong here may be one operating on a level of intelligence far superior to our own\nmister worf initiate a level two security alert on all decks until further notice\nno of course not lieutenant security alert two\nwere on our way chief\nthis tells me that a large spatial anomaly has appeared in the neutral zone in the dev ron system\nno well proceed to farpoint\nyou heard me\nmister worf will you man your station\nive no intention of explaining to anyone we will proceed with our mission to farpoint as planned chief obrien ami right in thinking that your e having a problem with the warp plasma inducers\nwell i know how to get them back online your e with me well be in main engineering\nmister obrien will you use these specifications to bypass the secondary plasma inducer\nbut the chief engineer isnt on board mister obrien trust me i know you can do it all those years you spent as a child building those model starship engines they were well worth it\nfrom your starfleet records\ncommander data welcome onboard its so very good to see you\ni could use your help with the infuser array\nas you can see were having difficulty with the plasma conduits\nit happened again\nyes\nits still a little vague but i can remember more this time it seems that everytime i shift periods i can retain more memory at first it appeared that i was in the future years from now and then i was in the past just before our first mission\ncounsellor do you remember when i first came onboard the enterprise\nwhat happened after the welcoming ceremony\ndo you have any memory of my calling red alert in space dock do you remember starfleet diverting us from farpoint to the neutral zone to investigate a spatial anomaly\nfor all i know i may find the same thing in the future\nthese are all very important questions and perhaps i will find answers to them in the past but now we have a potentially dangerous threat from the romulans i want all departments to present a battle readiness report to me at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow morning dismissed\ni want continuous subspace sweeps we may be able to detect a temporal disturbance\nwill this time shifting when it happens i experience a momentary disorientation if that should happen during a crisis i want you to take command immediately number one\nspeaking of disorientation are you all right\nyou have the bridge number one ill be in my ready room\ncome\nwhats this\nbeverly\nyes sir what hey beverly\nbut you said yourself that this is only a possibility\ni prefer to look on the future as something which is not written in stone a lot of things can happen in twenty five years\nyes what is it have we reached the neutral zone\nsorry i was in the past again whats going on\nnon on ono we have to get to the neutral zone\nin the other two time periods starfleet reported a sort of a spatial anomaly inin in the dev ron system in dev ron system in the neutral zone\nif the anomaly appeared there in the past then it might be here too and we have to find out\nbut if it is here then it means something damnit geordi i know what we have to do\nright right klingons in this time period the klingons have taken over the romulan empire\ni know that i havent completely lost my mind you know\nright now i think its time to call in some old favours contact admiral riker starbase two four seven\nwill if this spatial anomaly really is in the dev ron system\nwell i dont believe it what if their long range scanners are faulty we have to go there and see for ourselves\nwill that is just not good enough\ndamn him anyway after all we ve been through together hes been sitting behind that desk too long\nmedical ship\nyes yes\ni think i can arrange that data find the pasteur i have some pull with the captain at least i used to have\nlets just choose one\nso did you get my message\noh so thats why you married me\nyes thats it worf yes thats the answer worf will help us\nyes\nso you kept the name\nno im fine i dont need rest\nlook you are treating me as if i am an invalid i do have a few years left in me yet i do not want to be led around and i do not want to be patronised\nno will go and get some rest\nwell find the anomaly i know we will\nreport\nis there anything unusual in the vicinity mister data\nthere should be a barrier of some sort nearby a large plasma field highly disruptive\nthis is the right time the right place he should be here now\nq were here this has gone on long enough counsellor do you sense an alien presence\ni dont understand this is not the way its supposed to happen maintain this position ill be in my ready roomq\nqi knew it whats going on q\nthe last time that is too d here was seven years ago q\nyou accused me of being the representative of a barbarous species q\nwe demonstrated to you that mankind had become peaceful and benevolent you agreed and you let us go on our way now why ami standing here again q\nare you putting mankind on trial again q\nis there any connection between the trial seven years ago and whatever s going on now q\nthe spatial anomaly in the neutral zone is it related to whats happening q\nis it part of a romulan plot a ploy to start a war q\nthats only four q\ndid you create the anomaly q\nare you responsible for my shifting through time q\nwhy q\nguilty of what q\nweve journeyed to countless new worlds weve contacted new species we have expanded our understanding of the universe q\nwe are what we are and were doing the best we can it is not for you to set the standards by which we should be judged q\nyour e going to deny us

have a bigger problem than i thought\nnormally i would agree with you but this time i feel that somehow it is different there was a deadly earnestness about him i think he s serious which means that in some fashion i am going to be the cause of the destruction of humanity\nso what ami going to do lock myself in a room in all three different time periods\nagreed ive been thinking about my conversation with q he admitted that he was responsible for my shifting through time now it occurred to me that he might be giving me a chance somehow to save humanity\nwell hes always had a certain fascination with humanity with myself in particular i think he has more than a passing interest in what happens to me\nif i werent travelling through time i would never have realized that the anomaly in the neutral zone appeared there in the past as well assuming that san important piece of a larger puzzle my ability to shift through time may be the key to understanding whats going on\ngo ahead\nwere on our way\nall stop initiate long range scans\nwe are mister worf hail the romulan flagship\non screen\nbut surely worf you must still have some influence we have to get into the neutral zone cant you just get us permission to cross the border\ni dont care what kind of ship we goin we have to get to the dev ron system\ni know that im an old man and im out of touch but the worf that i remember was more concerned with things like honour and loyalty than rules and regulations but that was a long time ago may be your e not the worf once i knew\nbecause it always works worf your

that im be having erratically\ni understand but i also know what this crew is capable of even if they dont\ni know its difficult operating in the dark but right now i dont think i have any other choice\nexcuse me put him through here commander riker i wanted to inform you that well be delayed in picking you up at farpoint station\ni cant say ill keep you updated will you inform doctor crusher and lieutenant laforge of our delay\nis there anything else counsellor\nwhat about him\ni see do you think this will interfere with your duties\ni appreciate your telling me but im quite sure that the two of you will find some way to deal with the situation\ntea earl grey hot\nthere is an alternative to mol ak we each know why were here we could each send one ship into the neutral zone to investigate the anomaly in the dev ron system\nno\nthere is no need to make threats we each know the consequences\nhelm set course for the dev ron system warp five\nengage\nall stop on screen full scan mister data\nwe have to get as much information as possible about that anomaly\nall stop on screen then it is larger in the past\nnothing full scan mister data\non screen on screen lets see it\ni dont understand it was here in the other two time periods why isnt it here now\nyour e not thinking about leaving\nthere should be there has to be data is there some other way to scan for a temporal disturbance something that isnt covered in a normal sensor sweep\nthats it make it so\nbut six more hours may not be enough we have to stay here until we find it no matter how long it takes\nbeverly i can not believe that you are not willing to stay here until we\ndamnit i was just trying to look there are larger concerns here what you dont understand is that\nyour e right i was out of line it wont happen again but what you have to understand is what is at stake here q has said that all of humanity will be destroyed\nwhat\nq what is going on here where is the anomaly q\nanswer me q\nwhat help q\nmy time shifting the answer does lie there doesnt it now tell me one thing this anomaly were looking for will that destroy humanity q\nby doing what when how can\nreport mister data\nwhat is the source of this energy\nwhat if we modified the main deflector to emit an inverse tachyon pulse that might be able to scan beyond the subspace barrier that might give us some idea of what the interior of this thing looks like\ni have some friends who are quite well versed in it make it so\nhow is this possible\nanti time\nso if time and anti time were to collide\ndata what could have caused this collision of time and anti time\ni dont have time to discuss it now mister data do the modifications and send out the pulse then try working on a theory as to what caused this rupture mister obrien how large is this anomaly\ni dont understand why its bigger in the past\nlieutenant you have the bridge ill be in my ready room\nwhats going on\nweapons status\nwe have to stop it\nwe dont have time for this the pasteur score is going to breach\nno will we cant we have to save humanity\nwill dont leave we have to stay here and find what is causing the temporal anomaly\nwe have to everything depends on it we cant leave now please listen to me\nhow is she\nso this is affecting the entire crew\nwe have to find out how widespread this effect is contact starbase twenty three thats the nearest outpost have them check their personnel to see if there are any signs of temporal reversion\nmister data how close are you to completing the tachyons can\ngood when its done i want you to find some way of collapsing this anomaly without making things worse give me a risk analysis of whatever solution you come up with\ndismissed q\nwhy will that cause the destruction of mankind q\nhome q\nq is there any point to all this q\nso the anomaly is here too at earth q\nthe further back in time the larger the anomaly q\nare you saying that i caused the anomaly and that the anomaly somehow disrupted the beginnings of life on earth q\nlets concentrate on how this anomaly was initially formed speculation\nis there any way that we can scan the interior\ndo you know what could\ndata do we have a tomographic imaging scanner on board\ncan you use it to scan the interior of the anomaly\nwhat is it\nthree pulses from three time periods converging at one point in space\ncomputer where is admiral riker\nensign how do i get to ten forward\nthank you\nwill will i know why its happening i know whats causing the anomaly we have to go back\ndamn it will i know why its happening we caused the anomaly with the tachyon pulse it happened three times will we did it in three different time periods\nwill you leave me alone damnit im not stupid will the tachyon pulses they were used in the same spot in three different time periods dont you see when the tachyon pulse used i mean i mean when the pasteur used the tachyon pulse then then we i mean everything started will we set everything in motion its like the chicken and the egg will the chicken and the egg we think it started in the past but it didnt it started right here in the future thats why its getting larger in the past\nyes right thats it\nyes thats why it gets larger in the past it grows as it travels backwards in time\ngo back will we go back to the dev ron system\ni was right\nwe must stop it here so it cant travel back through time\nthe next time im there its the first thing ill do\ndata disengage the tachyon pulse\ndo it the convergence of the tachyon pulses from the three time periods is what is causing the anomaly\nis there any change in the anomaly\ndisengage the tachyon pulse\ni know that but it is imperative that you disengage the tachyon pulse immediately\nwhy isnt the anomaly being affected\nive shut off the tachyon pulses in the other time periods but it hasnt changed the anomaly\nthat could be a problem the anomaly s so much larger in the other two time periods\nit may be dangerous to take the ship in\ninto the anomaly chief lay in a course for the exact centre and transfer all available power to the shields\nno lieutenant i can not\ni understand your concerns lieutenant and i know if i were in your position i would be doing the same thing looking for answers but your e not going to find any because i dont have any to give you i know it is difficult for you to understand but we have to take the ship into the very centre of the phenomenon and create a static warp shell now this will put the ship at risk quite frankly we may not survive but i want you to believe that i am doing this for a greater purpose and that what is at stake here is more than any of you can possibly imagine i know you have your doubts about me about each other about the ship all i can say is that although we have only been together for a short time i know that you are the finest crew in the fleet and i would trust each of you with my life so i am asking you for a leap of faith and to trust me\ntake us in chief\na static warp shell it could repair the barrier and collapse the anomaly\nmister data your e a clever man in any time period helm lay in a course for the centre of the anomaly and prepare to initiate a static warp shell\nthe other two enterprises theyre on their way\nall hands brace for impact\nmaintain course and speed mister data how long until we reach the

report\nare you saying that it worked we collapsed the anomaly q\ndid it work q\nwhat about my crew q\nthank you q\nyou had a hand in helping me get out of this q\ni sincerely hope that this is the

captains log supplemental starfleet command reports no unusual activity along the neutral zone and there is no sign of a temporal anomaly it would appear that iam the only member of the crew to retain

was going on\nactually sir there is i was debating whether to mention it and perhaps its about commander riker\ni think you should know he and i have had a prior relationship\nnot at all it happened

was it tell me what really happened\nthrough an act of kindness the romulans attacked the khi tomer outpost everyone was killed i was buried under the rubble and left for dead a human starfleet officer found me he took me to his home on gault and told his wife to raise me as his son\nbefore the age of inclusion\nwhen my foster brother and i were of age we entered the starfleet academy he hated it and returned to gault i stayed\nhardly none\nyes yes those feelings are part of me but i control them they do not rule me\ni have been in battle\nyes i do\nyou did not battle the ferengi\nyou destroyed a klingon vessel\nyes of course\nperhaps your dreams of glory no longer fit the time they belong buried with the past\nyes when relieved of its bulk the enterprise becomes an exceptional

permission to address the captain on the klingon vessel i know it is against standard procedure but there is something i must say\nk mong ibm us\nto plead\nyes they must be punished but not executed with dishonour\nwhat burns in their eyes fires my soul i hear their words and i see it all as it was part of me longs for that time\nthen send them to a planet in the hale e system where they can meet death on their feet with a weapon in their hands not tied and helpless\nyes\nsir\ncaptain permission to leave the bridge\ncaptain let me talk to him\nhe will wait only as long as he believes it is to his advantage the moment it is not he will fire his phaser into the dilithium crystal chamber\nyes he knows\nwhat will work\ncaptain picard will not comply\nput down the phaser\nbelieve it\nmy brother it is you who does not see you look for battles in the wrong place the test of the warrior is not without it is within here here we meet the challenge it is the weaknesses in here a warrior must overcome\nyou have talked of glory and of conquest and legends we will write\nyet in all you say where are the words duty honour loyalty without which a warrior is nothing\nput down the

towards a treaty and proud that we have something of great value to offer you a priceless life giving vaccine the abduction i have done according to our custom for all to see your conduct in this matter has been beyond exemplary captain picard but now that the moment has come i find i can not part with her\nthis is not an act of war but of love i want lieutenant yar to become my first one\nthen you shall have no treaty no vaccine and no lieutenant yar ships log first officer riker reporting we have been informed of the challenge to lieutenant yar and are maintaining combat readiness round the clock we are probing l utans compound deeply with our sensors now still unnoticed\ni am in the grip of forces you do not understand\nyou surprise me captain what do you know of needs and feelings\nnot iya reena i am merely a spectator\nwe understand they are highly pleasant things but after all unimportant except for the land they own\na code of honour protects one captain like a magic cloak\ncombatants hold your positions return the weapon\nbut what of your lieutenant yar she is to become my first one now\nat least all has not been lost\nah yes of course\nshe is not dead there was no death combat you violated our agreement there will be no treaty no vaccine\nthere was no challenges he lives\nbut this is witchcraft ya reena to discard a mate in this manner\nya

you do us the additional honour of now letting us entertain you\nlut an we are aware of many of your planets achievements and its unique similarity to an ancient earth culture we all admire on behalf of the federation therefore i would like to present this token of our gratitude and friendship from chinas sung dynasty fourteenth century\nah yes indeed\nif you require respect from us i am sure that you will see it\nif there is something else any further courtesy\nand used for many other things too commander riker perhaps you and counsellor troi will demonstrate\nvery well\nunderstanding has made friends of many different people weve had a good beginning lut an\npicard to bridge red alert\nwhat comm contact have we had with them\nmake contact there and on all hailing frequencies this is the enterprise to lut an and the ligon ian government you have committed an unfriendly act we insist that you reply immediately\nset them for a display blast a thousand metres short of the planets surface\nfire\nthis is captain picard of the enterprise with a message to lut an whom i have so far acknowledged as a friend but you have now committed what our laws regard as an attack upon us since you have visited our vessel you most certainly know the power of it we insist that you reply to this message opinion counsellor will they injure lieutenant yar\nother comments\nyes doctor\nyou were testing if you can replicate the vaccine\nim aware of that doctor\nthats true but i have seen my share of death\nperhaps the good ones never get them\nwhat oh yes alright\nwell yes speaking as a mother\nwesley\nno\nwhy dont you sit at ops next to lieutenant laforge\nis the whole ship deaf sit down over there young man temporarily\nexcuse me doctor crusher some of this may interest you lets hear the analysis\nmister data the french language for centuries on earth represented civilisation\nwell lut an what do you want\nwhat is required is an image of lieutenant yar well and\nask for her\nand now lut an you have boldly taken lieutenant yar from us and we ask that you now please return her\nlut an is a fortunate man youve met counsellor troi\nthen sir the courtesy of seeing lieutenant yar\nid like to see her now\nsuch as the politeness of saying please before abducting someone\nyours is a different world\nhave you been treated well lieutenant\nmy ships company andi are certain of your gentle wisdom in that\nsomething to be carefully avoided i agree\nuntil tonight lut an\nlut an you have granted us hospitality and the safety of your centre place the gifts you give us are rare and precious we thank you and now according with the customs of your ancestors whom we honour and respect i am here in peace to ask for the return of lieutenant yar\nyou speak of a code of honour but what you are saying now according to our customs is called an act of war\nnot he challenge is unequivocally refused\ndid you have any idea lieutenant that lut an was suddenly going to announce that he wanted you for his first one\ntell me what you know about this\nwere all being manipulated lieutenant myself most of all\nthat thought had passed through my mind counsellor\nif anything even worse than wed heard\nyou have nothing to prove anything here lieutenant\ncounsellor your e the last person id expect to argue in favour of accepting the challenge\nthe odds are\ni want some explanations from lut an\nits a great pity you began by abducting my security officer lut an because i should tell you ido admire the hospitality you offer here\nsome of it i do understand she is a rather lovely female\nnothing well almost nothing in my position of ships captain\nbut it puzzles me if you feel that way for tasha why have you challenged her to a fight to the death\nah but you are also a man of great importance and wealth\nahi see you too understand the proper value of women\nyou are a truly clever person lut an you stand to lose nothing either way the challenge goes\ni will order lieutenant yar to fight and may your cloak bring you all you deserve\nlock in on this location\nenergise\nyouve both seen the message about the plague\nwe need to know as much as possible about ligon ian armaments data especially important is an analysis of their combat capabilities geordi concentrate on their cutting edge s wherever applicable durability composition weaknesses of material\nfrom the perspective of lieutenant yar using them in combat with l utans wife\nand that wont be known until combat begins your e right data it does sound like a joke with the power of the enterprise we could overwhelm this place easily just take what we want\nwhich means of course\nthat is ironically what this is about by our standards the customs here their code of honour is the same kind of pompous strutting charades that endangered our own species a few centuries ago we evolved out of it because no one else imposed their own im sorry this is becoming a speech\nnot entitled to ramble on about something everyone knows carry on ships log commander william riker reporting continuing our appraisal of ligon ian technology the captain has made it clear he wants lieutenant yar beamed immediately to safety if her life should become endangered and i fervently hope the rules of that contest make it possible\nthen help me please what is a way out of this\npoison\nwhat about those lengths of metal in the yard outside\nthank you data\ngo ahead riker were alone\nthank you number one lieutenant do you still feel that you want to go through with this challenge do you judge your condition good\nstay alive well hope to do the rest hagon\nexactly what do you find unfair lut an they fought to the death you saw the final blow you know the effects of your poison\ni certainly wont stop her if she cares to claim that honour\npicard here\nno problem number one send down a medical team\nfive to beam up energise first officers log stardate 412356iam returning the conn to captain picard as we begin loading the vaccine supply aboard shortly we hope to signal mission complete\nthis way gentlemen\nthe challenge was carried out she died lut an\nlut an we can provide you with records of her death and how doctor crusher brought her back\nwhat wesley\nwell thanks again for manning one of our bridge stations wesley well see that you have another chance\nso whats the

things im worried about lieutenant yar too sir but maybe we should sit and wait them out stardate 4123532i am concerned over a full day of waiting with no response from lut an we are now testing whether they are aware of our sensors probing them so far we believe we have pinpointed l utans government compound\nits all rights i rill see that he leaves immediately\nno\ni suggest you drop it mister data\nand under these circumstances lut an considers himself heroic risking literally everything in the face of our superior power\nweve studied this in some depth now sir the proper thing for you to do now is to ask to get tasha back\ncommander thats quite formal\nand im very much against that ideal utan is clearly a liar and devious counsellor troi has admitted she believes he s capable of killing it is my duty to keep the captain from danger sir\nyes it seems reasonable put that way but i warn you if you get hurt ill put you on report captain\nwhat is this message from starbase

physically very attractive but with lu tani felt something else something more like avarice or ambition\ncaptain we have more information from the briefing studies on ligon\nand it fit slut ans

and bold\ncommander\nso is this request sir we believe it would be preferable if the captain led this away party\nand the custom requires that lut an should die rather than violate that\none can see

would die\nis only to increase the potency of the felici um and tighten your grip\nno dont do it jean luc this is not a symbiotic relationship this is exploitation pure and simple the br ekki ans have

bi\nwe have to resolve this soon there is nt much time\neverything we had went down with the sanction\ntell me you could have repaired it\nwe have only two left neither works properly they are

everything i can you see what happened was\nyou will take us to our planet and leave us there with our medicine or this person dies dont you see i have no choice we were sent to bring the felici um

laboratory\nthis appears to be the instrument doctor manheim described it should confirm when the next time effect will occur\ni will know in a moment sir according to calculations the next time effect will occur in one minute thirty seconds\ni will need to add a specific amount of antimatter to rebalance and align the system\ntheoretically yes in reality i do not know\nwhen the effect hits the force fields will align opening a clean straight path to the other dimension whatever the time distortion i must add the antimatter at the appropriate moment geordi if the professor was right i will need a twenty seven second countdown\ncaptain i now have the antimatter and am moving towards the opening at the end of the lab the next time distortion should occur within seconds geordi begin countdown onmymarknow3\ncaptain there appear to be three of us1\nshould i drop the antimatter or wait for one of you 3\nonly one of us is at the correct time continuum 1\nwhich one 2\nme its me\nyes sir\nit is well patched sir closed indicates a permanent condition which i can not guarantee\nwith pleasure sir\ni took advantage\ninteresting move sir but what technique was that\ninteresting move sir but what technique was that\ncaptain what was that\nmonsieur welcome to the cafe des artistes is this your first time in paris\nthis way\nmais oui bien sur monsieur we are here to please you\nsome wine some cheese\nperhaps what you hunger for is not on the menu\nyour young lady she did not come\nyou however did not ah well trust edouard i will bring something very special just for you\nmadame this way the captain is waiting for you\nbien sur pourquoi pas\nlets go weve waited long enough\nhes not coming gabrielle\nthen he would be here you are making a fool out of yourself and i will not watch\nfine you go ill stay a little longer\nno after last night i know he will i just know\ndo we know each other\nthe way you look at me doi remind you of someone\nhes not coming why what did i do to drive him away\nof what of me\nfive four three two one\nenterprise thankyou for hearing us where are you\nthen you can help me i dont know what to do its only the two of us left he shaving convulsions please\nyes i know\nill try\nseveral hours at least he was in his lab so i cant be sure\njean luci thought the voice sounded familiar\ni should have known who else would have charged to my rescue\nthank you\ni hope i can be of some help\nthey were working in the second lab something happened there a few weeks ago they were all killed it was a terrible accident i dont know exactly what happened so many brilliant wonderful minds just gone\npauls always been interested in time he s never believed that it was immutable any more than space is immutable over the last decade he came to believe that we reside in one of infinite dimensions and what holds us here is the constancy of time change that and it would be what he called opening the window to those other dimensions\nhave you been experiencing something up here\nthat would explain his anxiety i had no idea it had gone so far beyond vandor\nall i can tell you about that is paul and the rest of the team searched for two years to find it vandor s exactly what they needed a planetoid around a binary star\nno but he did say that he was very close to proving his theories and then the accident\ni didnt think so now in retrospect he probably did that would explain all the unusual precautions he began taking even before the accident the forcefield the elaborate security system every time he started a new experiment he insisted that i stay in what he said called a protected room\njean luc he would never knowingly do anything to hurt anyone\nbut as he saw his goal getting closer seeming possible he became more and more obsessive maybe that clouded his judgement this is not how i imagined seeing you again\nyouve done well a great starship in the far reaches of the galaxy its everything you d hoped\nyou can tits protected one of the other scientists made sure no one could get in\nis he worse\nthankyou for your kindness doctor\npaul thank god your e on the enterprise they answered your distress signal\noh paul your e going to be just fine\nhelp him\nim sorry for intruding i was told id find you here\ni knew you wouldnt come to me\nwe have unfinished business\nwhy didnt you come to meet me that last day in paris\noh i didnt want this\nthe truth\nof course a nice soft painless lie\nah thats better it was raining and you couldnt find a cabi waited all day and it was raining it rained the rest of the week i went to starfleet headquarters looking for you but you d already shipped out so come on jean luc lets hear the truth\nfor a longtime not a day went by when i didnt look up into the sky and wonder\nive thought a lot about this over the years and perhaps your e leaving out your greatest fear the real reason you left\nthat life with me would have somehow made you ordinary\nonly to me\npaul\nhow is he\ndescribe it\ndont tell me were going back\nwell be going back\nit always is my love you said my life would never be dull and it never has been\nhow is this possible its paris unbelievable\nthis is so real\njean luc dont tell me how you did it i dont care its perfect its as if we were really there\ni expect you to always come charging to my rescue\ngoodbye jean luc be well\nthankyou for paris\nwell so much for my dramatically romantic exit\njust like a feeling of deja vu\naye sir\naye sir warp eight\nestimated arrival peg os minor four hours thirty five minutes

of it it was all worth it again its changing again\nim having difficulty\ni have been on the other side i have touched another dimension part of me is still there\nmy mind is floating between two places it is difficult to know which is which there is no way to explain it\nthe same ones he has told me about you not all but enough\nit will get worse\nim having difficulty holding the moment\nhow is that possible i am not even fully versed on all of my theories\nandroid on a starfleet vessel\nyour knowledge is useless because the work we have done here has made most of those theories obsolete\nthen you do understand yes we were able to locate an energy source in the centre of this planetoid we learned to enhance it to focus it everything worked too well the energy from the pulsar the energy from the planetoid we opened a crack a window into another dimension\nfelt then it is not confined to the planetoid\ncaptain it must be stopped you must help me to execute a controlled shutdown of this experiment get my notes theyre in the lab\nill give you the correct coordinates to be am safely down to vandor and the codes you need to bypass security systems to get into my lab\ni am not sure i remembered all of the codes for the security system you should warn anyone going down there\nwhat i really wanted to talk to you about is je nice\nit is only this if anything should go wrong please take care of her for me\nshe never would admit this but she has had a terrible time these last years had we not been so isolated she might have left me and i never would have known at least not right away perhaps im not a man who should have a woman like her she deserves better\nwhere is my wife is she all right\nje nice\nthe effect has been reversed i can feel it were safe\ni feel like im coming out of a long tunnel its there not at all like i thought it would be different\ni cant not yet the only words that fit are too pale because the images are so vibrant its not like anything anyone has ever experienced before there was no no there is this kind of life not like us not like this whats the condition of my lab\nohje nice we are so close we have learned so much to walk away besides we owe it to the others our friends there have been so many sacrifices by so many good people\nthank you this time it will be different i promise\nthank you\nno no lieutenant the

it much thought how did we get here\nit must have been my husband donald if it was new and foolish he would have popped for it well ill say this for it its the first thing he s ever bought into that worked\nwhats going to happen to us do we stay here with you do we go back to earth\ni dont know it just started and it wont stop i keep thinking about my boys\nthey sent you here to settle me down\nthe local shrink\nit doesnt matter\ni cant stop crying i miss my sons and then i think im here but they are gone donald thats my husband i love that man but good intentions aside hed mess up a free lunch why on earth he ever decided to do this\nnoi can tell you exactly what happened he couldnt think about going on alone i died and he couldnt face it so he figured if he had me frozen then in his mind i wasnt really gone it sounds crazy but you had to know donald i wish i knew what happened to my children did they get married did they have kids\ntommy hes eight and eddies five\nthey were born in secaucus thats in jersey can this really work can this tell me whats happened to them\nwell whether we do or not i want to thank you for trying date of birth tommy was born february

donald thats my husband\nhes the spitting image\nno ill be out of time a relic\ntheres no denying that\nnineteen hours twenty eight minutes\nfull names date and place of birth\ncaptain picard is located on the main bridge\nits the people from the capsule\nthe people data beamed over\nwell he did and they were frozen i thawed them\ni didnt know what else to do the crypts in which they were frozen were literally falling apart\nright now they are all sleeping each of them needed minor medical attention minor now but then their conditions were obviously terminal one had a heart problem another had an advanced case of emphysema with extensive liver damage you know the most surprising thing of all is that each of them had been frozen after they died\ncryonics it was a kind of fad in the late twentieth century people feared dying it terrified them at the moment of death they would be frozen so that later sometime in the future when presumably medical science had a cure for whatever killed them they could be thawed back to life healed and sent on about their business\nalive and well and ready to be awakened\ni have them sedated now but they should be up and about as soon as possible\nnone that i can see\nshe died of an embolism it probably happened very suddenly otherwise her physical condition was excellent\nadvanced cardiomyopathy inoperable at the time but easily correctable now he must have known his condition was terminal for quite some time\nthere was marked deterioration of every system in his body probably from massive chemical abuse unbelievable\ntoo afraid to live too scared to die\nits perfectly fine in fact you are all now in excellent health\nshe means worf\nperfectly sound\nabout three hundred and seventy years ago you died of a massive embolism\nyou and the others were frozen\nyou have no medical need\nsorry\ni beg your pardon\nyou mean lieutenant commander data\nill let him know your e looking for him\nmuch obliged\ncommander request permission to investigate this vehicle\nit is a piece of history the opportunity to examine such an ancient vehicle does not come around very often and as you pointed out we do have the time\nthank you sir\nminimal oxygen atmosphere an ancient solar generator still operating\nthe onboard computers have ceased functioning i may be able to download this old style disk drive back to the enterprise\nnot necessary\nthe seal was broken and the environment has been corrupted\nthis one is empty\nif that were the purpose there would be evidence of a more sophisticated monitoring system these containers were designed solely for refrigeration\n\nthree the vehicle has suffered severe damage most of her systems have failed\ni do not believe we should leave them here sir with your permission we will be returning with three containers\ni could not leave them there captain the condition of their vehicle was deteriorating\ni see your point captain but at the time it seemed the proper thing to do\ni was able to retrieve some information from the ancient disk i removed from the modules computer her name is clare raymond age thirty five occupation homemaker must be some kind of construction work\nhis name is ralph offen house age fifty five occupation financier\nmuch of his file we could not retrieved his name is lq sonny c lemon ds apparently his occupation had something to do with music\nby your calendar two thousand three hundred sixty four\nactually there is a distinct difference between an android and a robot\nyou were in a space module\nhooey a has in hogwash malarky jive an intentional fabrication\nactually the process of cryonics was never more than a fad and did not continue much beyond the mid twenty first century\ntalk\nis there something wrong\ni believe he means television sir that particular form of entertainment did not last much beyond the year two thousand forty\nwhat is to be done with them sir\ncommander a low mileage pi two of ie\nthese are the most unusual humans i have ever encountered\nsince we have no contact with the romulans for fifty three years seven months eighteen days we must consider that the information we do have is out of date\nthe strategy is built on a single premise the hostile intent of the romulans if the premise is sound so is the proposal\nit was a passenger liner which mostly travelled earths atlantic ocean during the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries\nyou asked to see me\na celebration\ni will speak to the captain\ninquiry you do not seem to be having as much difficulty adjusting to your current circumstances as the others\nno but the computer can replicate such an instrument\ni must leave now\nit is a buffer between the romulan empire and the federation\ni do not know\nno that would not be appropriate captains log supplemental we have arrived at the edge of the neutral zone where we will now have an opportunity to learn first hand what happened to our distant outpost\ncaptain there is nothing left of outpost delta zero five\nsensors indicate no evidence of conventional attack\nthe condition is identical captain\nnegative sir\nsensors indicate all of their systems are armed sir\nthat offer does present a certain fascination\ni wonder how it got out here\nthe captains shuttle is approaching the main shuttle bay sir\nlaying it in sir\ncaptain those coordinates will take us right into the neutral zone\naye sir warp eight\nby the romulans\nif their intention is nt hostile what is it\nmust have been one hell of an explosion\nsir\naye sir\nwe are approaching ta rod nine\nwe wanted to know if they have improved the cloaking device guess we have our answer\nthe last time we encountered them was decades ago cost thousands of lives\ncaptain i have plotted a course to intercept the charleston but they ve just informed me that they ll be making an extended stop at arl off nine\nwell at warp eight we could have our guests at starbase thirty nine sierra in five days take months off their journey\naye sir warp six\n\nmister laforge set course zero five eight mark one seven three\nnumber one i want a staff meeting on the observation deck\nthat is correct mister laforge warp factor eight\nengage\ntwo federation out posts in sector three zero have been destroyed theres been no communication with federation star bases in sector three one since stardate 419032\nthats the assumption\nthe question are why now whats their objective for fifty years theres barely a whisper out of them and now for no apparent reason they seem to be back with a roar\nthe strategic decision is to send one ship\ntrue enough its a gamble\nif force is necessary we will use it but that will mean we have failed our goal here is to establish some kind of relations with the romulans if we dont succeed then to convince them of our resolve the general feeling at starfleet is that they are seeking a confrontation they may want to test themselves in battle against a federation starship see how far we have advanced if that is the case then i need to know it counsellor is hall need a full profile on them\ncomputer estimated arrival time at the neutral zone\nlets reassemble in six hours stay sharp no surprises i would rather out think them than out fight them questions\nwhat is it doctor\ncapsule people what people\ni wasnt aware that he had\nyou what\nso whats their condition\nafter they died\nin the case of this group it apparently worked mister data will you report to sickbay\nimmediately\nlook i am never critical of any member of my staff being curious but its just that the timing is so\nbut data they were already dead i mean what more could have happened to them\nwell theyre alive now were going to have to treat them as living human beings\nbefore you wake them up i want to have security here lieutenant worf report to sickbay\nwell then we have no other choice\nwelcome to the twenty fourth century\nthat sounds like someone who hated life yet he had himself frozen presumably so he could go through it all again\ndoctor this seems to be a situation more suited to your talents ill leave it with you ill be on the bridge\nnumber one kindly take charge of our guests until we have time to decide what were going to do with them\nnumber one keep them out of my way\ncounsellor anything would be helpful\ncounter punchers thank you counsellor thats quite valuable\nnumber one\nwould you and mister data report to the bridge\nreport\nhow many outposts are there in this sector\ngo on\nthe enterprise\nwhat are you recommending\nmister data\nthis is captain picard to whom ami speaking\nwhat is going on here number one did you give him permission to contact me\nlisten mister offen house were in a very important conference right now\ndata identify what is a qe two\nhes comparing the enterprise to a cruise ship\nim captain picard\nwe may indeed those comm panels are for official ship business\naboard a starship that is not necessary we are all capable of exercising self discipline now you will refrain from using them\nwe are in a very serious and potentially dangerous situation\ni dont think you are aware of your situation or of how much time has passed\nyour lawyer has been dead for centuries\nthats what this is all about a lot has changed in the past three hundred years people are no longer obsessed with the accumulation of things weve eliminated hunger want the need for possessions we have grown out of our infancy\npower to do what\nthat kind of control is an illusion\nwhat is it\ncounsellor troi will you report to the guest lounge\nslow to half impulse im on my way\nill inform her\nits the first thing youve said i do understand ill see what i can do and please stay off the comm panels\ncounsellor will you get those people under control we can not afford this continuing distraction\ncan you determine what happened\ncould it have been a natural phenomenon\nmister laforge\nset course for the next closest station\ni appreciate your advice and concern but this is not the time for rash actions we are still investigating there are three other stations in this sector we have to visit lets proceed in a calm and orderly manner\nyes number one that would be prudent make it so\nwait if that is a romulan ship they will read our intent itll force them into taking a similar posture we dont want to engage in battle\nno\ndamn mister data are your sensors picking up anything you should be detecting a disturbance\nthey were trying to determine our intent they wanted to see if we would fire\nstay calm everyone open hailing frequencies\nlieutenant control your emotions please open hailing frequencies\nromulan vessel this is captain jean luc picard of the uss enterprise\nbut they ve not fired lets try them again\ncommander you have crossed the neutral zone this is federation territory\nit might be viewed as an act of aggression\nlieutenant worf s question is valid\ndo you think that we attacked your outposts\nwho is responsible\nyes but its a correct assessment\ni would like to offer a proposal\nnothing so grandiose just this cooperation there was an intent here whoever or whatever did this is more powerful than either of us lets collaborate lets share whatever we learn about what has happened here\ncommander we have made some progress here lets not ruin that with unnecessary posturing\ni think our lives just became a lot more complicated get him off my bridge\nheres what i propose you cant stay on the enterprise but i have arranged for us to rendezvous with the uss charleston bound for earth they will deliver you there\nthis is the twenty fourth century material needs no longer exist\nthe challenge mister offen house is to improve yourself to enrich yourself enjoy it\nperhaps so anything is possible\nyour point mister laforge\nbut they ll benefit from the extended time it will allow them to acclimate before returning to earth\nthat would take us in the wrong direction our mission is to go forward and its just begun set velocity warp six mister laforge\ntheres still much to do still so much to learn mister laforge

this is the worst run ship i have ever been on\nyou should take some lessons from the qe two now that san efficient operation\ncaptain picardi demand that you see me i think i have been very very patient\ni demand a phone or a radio whatever else you have frankly enough is enough especially under the circumstances and considering what i paid for this procedure i must make contact with my law\nexcellent now may be well be able to get some things straightened out\nif they are so important why dont they need an executive key\nnow just a minute\nim sure whatever it is seems very important to you but my situation is far more critical\nbelieve me im fully cognisant of where i am and when it is simply that i have more to protect than a man in your position could possibly imagine no

firm is still operating\nyou ve got it all wrong its never been about possessions its about power\nto control your life your destiny\nreally im here arent ii should be dead but im not\ncaptain i didnt mean to come on so strong its just that ive built my whole life on knowing whats going on for the first time i feel completely out of touch its making me crazy you can understand that\ni have spent my career being able to tell when the other guys mouth is dry there is something going on here something serious the tension level on this ship has jumped up\nim trying to tell you that there is a situation developing on this vessel that directly affects us and all you can talk about is that stupid guitar\nthat may be all right for you but i am not willing to allow my fate to be decided by other si at least want to know what is going on\nah lets see i want to go to the er where would the captain be\nwell then take me to the main bridge\nwho the hell are they\nim not going anywhere\ni can believe that\nthey havent got a clue theyre hoping you know but they re too arrogant to ask\nthen what will happen to us theres no trace of my money my office is gone what will ido how willi live\nthen whats the challenge\ni think not mister worf its just a piece of space debris if we had nt sitting here waiting for the captain we wouldnt have noticed it leave it be let nature take its course how long until captain picard returns\nwhy data its just a derelict\nvery well be prepared to be am back before the captain returns\nlieutenant worf go with him\naye sir well make all preparations commander data return to the enterprise immediately\nfrozen how many\nare you suggesting they be transferred to the enterprise\nwhatever you do do it quickly\ntheres been no direct contact with the romulans since the tom ed incident\neverything we know about them is based on rumour or conjecture\nthe enterprise\nthis first encounter coming so suddenly after all this time we have to assume its a set up\naye sir\ni know this is all very confusing to you so ill attempt to explain you are on the starship enterprise\nno its a vessel of the united federation of planets and earth is a member\nan android\nhesa klingon that takes a little more explanation\noh yes absolutely\nnow if you didnt contract for this who did\na phone call\nah thats going to be a little difficult right at the moment\ni think we should take the doctors advice take this very slowly until weve all adjusted and then well talk to the captain\ntv\nriker here\nat once sir\nthe captain\nthat will all be up to the captain\nill pass along your request if you ll excuse us\ni dont know\nthis time you ve got me i havent a clue\nwell from what ive seen of our guests theres not much to redeem them it makes one wonder how our species survived the twenty first century\ni think we work on the assumption theyve all been destroyed\nit fits their historical pattern\nthe positive side of that is the information they have about us is also out of date captain i think its that lack of information that this is all about\nin my opinion the romulans want a confrontation specifically with us\nwell not by name but the federation they know the federation will send their best that ll give them a perfect chance to see firsthand how far weve advanced both in technology and technique\nim not sure i have a specific recommendation perhaps we should assume the initiative\nof course not he must have seen me use the comm panel\ncaptain we are approaching science station delta zero five\ncommander data we are approaching the neutral zone report to the bridge\ncaptain i strongly recommend that we go to red alert if the romulans have improved their cloaking device and wed be fools to believe they havent we should assume a more defensive posture\nif not battlestations may we at least take the ship to yellow alert\nshields up\ncaptain i recommend we transfer all power to phasers and arm the photon torpedoes\ncaptain this is sufficient evidence outposts have been destroyed countless lives have been lost\ntheyll only be vulnerable for an instant as they become visible\nwhere are they\nget that man off the bridge now\namazing i never thought i would ever see a romulan ship not this close\nyour e out of line mister\nits a pity we cant take them ourselves having them on board is like a visit from the past\nwhat is that\nyou mean a robot\nnow listen guys i paid some idiot a lot of money to freeze me when i died and i just got to hear the words ami alive\nand the liver that was about to explode in my face\ncryonics you know freeze you now and heal you later\nthe whacko who sold me this scam said that by putting us in orbit there were nt gonna be no chance of a brown out\nthe whole deal was a long shot but i figured whatthehell might as well give them the dough instead of leaving it to my ex wives but you know son i figured it was all just a bunch of hooey\nthere you go now you got it\nid like me a thick kansas city steak and some country fried potatoes and a mess of greens oh hell just forget all that and give me have a martini straight up with two olives for the vitamins\nwrong only that your computer here fixed about the best martini i have ever had i just might get to like this place lets see if the braves are on how do you turn on this teevee\nyeah the boob tube id like to see how the braves are doing after all this time probably still finding ways to lose\nwell what do you guys do i mean you dont drink and you a int got no tv must be kind of boring a int it\nthe yankees right lets get the big boy in here\nduty calls hey i understand why dont you come back later on you and mell find us a couple of low mileage pi two of ies and help em build a memory\ncaptain i need to see that pretty little doctor of yours\ni taint a question of need darling its a matter of survival\nnot to worry old wa tosh ll scuffle along the best way he can how do i get ahold of that feller with the strange looking face\nwhats his name that android fella\nthats the one\nmuch obliged you know your e just about the prettiest little old doctor i ever seen\nlook im about to go out of my mind for something to do i mean sitting here alone just dont get it what say you and i put together a little party\nno nothing that fancy just some folks some suds and some sound shelli taint nothing but something to do\ngreat you do that\nyou mean being here on this tub four hundred years from where i started heck its the same dance its just a different tune you think anybody heres got a guitar i could borrow\ni was kind of hoping to get one while i still remember the chords\nwhats this neutral zone\nwhy does that make me nervous\nwe wont be inviting these romulans to our party will we\neven if youre right what can we do about it and besides these old boys here dont need us telling them where the bears its look here what that young fella made for me\nhe called it a pattern replication it plays real good too\nhey now these folks dont need us swimming in their soup so why dont you just relax and let em do their jobs\nwell one good thing is since everybodys forgotten everything i ever did it llall be brand spanking ne will be a bigger hit thani ever was\nwhat say you son you d make a hell of aside man\ni am commander te bok\nif we go to war let us be sure it is for the right reason we are here because our outposts which border the neutral zone were also attacked\nsilence your dog captain\nonce we realised the level of destruction we knew it could not have been you\nwe do not know who is responsible why entire outposts on both sides have been carried off\ncaptain picard because your actions are those of a thoughtful man ill you this matters more urgent caused our absence now witness the result outposts destroyed expansion of the federation everywhere yes we have indeed been negligent captain but no more\nyour presence is not wanted do you understand my meaning captain we are back\nit was necessary\nif our intent were aggression you would not be here now\ndestroyed in the exact same manner as your own\nto even to ask such a question implies that we need permission we do not\nan alliance between the romulans and the federation\nagreed on this one issue and only if it is convenient and appropriate at the time\nthere is limited information but i will prepare something\nas you know there is very little available on the romulans\nthey seem to be creatures of extremes one moment violent beyond description the next tender they are related to the vulcans but as each race developed their differences grew wider they are intensely curious their belief in their own superiority is beyond arrogance for some reason they have exhibited a fascination with humans and it is that fascination more than anything else that has kept the peace one other thing they will not initiate anything they will wait for you to commit yourself\nyes sir\nhello my name is deanna\nim the ships counsellor and i thought you might want to talk\nim sorry im not familiar with that term\nyour e feeling profoundly sad\nhe must have thought you would have wanted it\nlets see if we can find out computer this is counsellor troi request personal history on what are their names\nwell there must be a record somewhere there is a good chance we can find it\nten generations of your progeny\nno not at all\nive found something i have been able to locate a family living outside of indianapolis the mans name is thomas raymond\ncomputer let us see thomas raymond\nactually its your great great great great great grandson\nwell i have his address when you get back to earth you can go and see him\nperhaps but its a place to start after all he is family\namerican\nat its present speed and heading it will eventually enter the kaz is binary system and will certainly be destroyed i could attach a tractor beam and adjust its heading\nthe last

journey\nromulans\nwe could get out there and find ourselves greatly overmatched\nwe are six hours from the neutral zone i have been unable to establish communications with any federation colony or station in this vicinity\nnine\ni agree with commander riker this may be our only opportunity we should seize it\nthe outpost was not just destroyed its as though some great force just scooped it off the face of the planet\ninsufficient information sir\neveryone and everything is gone\ni agree captain i recommend we go immediately to battlestations\ncaptain my sensors indicate a disturbance it is large and moving but i can not get a positive lock nor can i get it on the viewscreen\naye sir\ni have a positive lock theyre disengaging their cloaking device\ncaptain this maybe our only chance\nthe signal is weakening\nive lost them\ncaptain theyre back\ncaptain these are romulans they are without honour they killed my parents in an attack on khi tomer when they were supposed to be our allies

breeding right now inside counsellor troi our purpose here is to determine what is to be done about this very unusual situation discussion\nthen it seems that the discussion is over captains log supplemental we have finally arrived at audet nine where we will pick up the specimens of plasma plague for transport to rachel is it is only because so many lives are at stake that i am willing to put this ship and crew at such great risk meanwhile counsellor trois pregnancy continues to progress at an astonishing rate\nhow are you feeling\nopen hailing frequencies\naudet nine this is captain jean luc picard of the uss enterprise\nexcuse me to whom ami speaking\nare the specimens ready for transfer\ni appreciate your caution in the like vein i want a complete detailed manifest of

supplemental although its been fourteen hours since we arrived at audet nine hester dealt has still not completed inspection of the containment unit a transfer will not be permitted until he s assured of zero growth during our voyage meanwhile the desperate pleas from the rachel is system continue\nat last review it with doctor pulaski i want you both to be completely familiar with it\ndoctor welcome to the bridge please sit down how is counsellor troi did she have a good night\nim not sure of your point\ndata how long before we begin the transfer\nnumber one you have the bridge\nyou will accompany me doctor please i think its time i paid my respects\ndeanna i wanted to see how you were and have a look at your baby my goodness how old is he\nyes but\nyou mean he can talk\nhello ian\npicard\ngo on\ni understand doctor do you have a recommendation\nthank you\ncommander data if you have completed your review you are needed in transporter room three\nno ian but thankyou for the

more to growing up than that its my belief number one that your e best qualified to supervise that are you willing to serve\nwell mister crusher communicate with your mother at starfleet medical

she came to me a few hours ago i have done two complete examinations of counsellor troi this is from the first examination the foetus is about halfway through the first trimester about six weeks old now understand we believe conception took place eleven hours ago\nit gets better this is the second exam one hour later now its consistent except for the fact that it appears the foetus is several weeks older at this growth rate counsellor troi will have her baby in about thirty six hours the normal gestation rate for a beta zoid is ten months\nits a male human or in this case half human half beta zoid\nin every way in fact there is nothing to indicate that there are any genetic patterns other than hers\noh you bet it is lets get you to maternity\nis that necessary\nwell its strange to need armed guards in a delivery room this way\nhow frequent are your contractions\nin my other deliveries except for a couple the father was always present\ncounsellor troi is going to need the comfort of a human touch not the cold hand of technology\nyour choice\nthere is nothing to be nervous about\nthis is an impatient baby hes eager to make his appearance do you want something for the pain it will in no way diminish the experience\nnone\nhave your security men stand back i understand the importance of having you here but keep out from underfoot foetal position\nfoetal pulse\nthe baby is showing healthy respiratory movements\nthe action of the heart rate is good the babys doing wonderfully troi breathe slowly your e doing great stay calm that sit there it is ive got him you can relax\nthere there thats a good boy its okay oh my hes beautiful are easy births the norm for beta zoids\nyou can come in the rest of the way now theres no threat lieutenant you and your men can relax its just a baby\ndo you have a name\nhow do you feel\namazing\ncaptain\nive delivered dozens of babies but none like this there was no pain no trauma\nit was effortless for both of them\nshe had her baby yesterday if i were to examine her now i would not be able to tell she had a baby or had ever had a baby it was as if the incident never happened\nin actuality a day\nin appearance almost four earth years old\nwe need a little more time its taking longer than we anticipated to categorise these specimens\ndata look at this\nwhat\noh\nwhats the difference\nis this possible with all of your neural nets algorithms and heuristics is there some combination makes up a circuit for bruised feelings possible i am unfamiliar with this symbol\nabout twenty percent of the specimens fall into that category some eager beaver at play\nwell in this case eager beaver refers to some overachieving genetic engineer who probably because of lack of anything better to do has forced this strain of virus to mutate just so we can see how bad bad can get captain picard\ni just wanted you to know what risks were about to take\nif the most innocuous specimen on the manifest list gets loose\nit will destroy all life on the enterprise in a matter of hours\nconsidering how desperately this is needed no i dont i just wanted you to know what we were carrying\nthats all right data data whatever\ni wanted to stop by and see how ian was doing\nlet me see that thats not so bad\nhe allowed himself to be burned\nwho is he why is he here what does he want\nyes captain\nim on my way\ndestroy it now\nwhy this one specimen and none of the others something is stimulating it do you have its etiology do you know how it was developed\nits a mutated strain developed by doctors us annu ress during an outbreak of plasma plague seventy years ago in the oby system it was number nine in a series of fifty eight tests this particular one bombarded by low levels of eichner radiation could exposure to eichner radiation stimulate growth\nwell it is now what emits that type of radiation\nalso not on this ship what else because its here and we better find it\nwhat happened did he eat anything did he fall\nim losing life signs\nim sorry\nacknowledged enterprise transfer complete good luck on your mission\ngive my regards to your captain repulse out\nopen hailing frequencies\nrepulse this is the

actually worse\ngo on\ncaptain we may not be able to get control of this situation i recommend we arrange transfer of all nonessential personnel to the saucer section\nif we lose containment we should be prepared to separate\nwhy didnt you detect this before\nthank you lieutenant\napparently so\nthere was a moment when you smiled\nill be glad to be relieved of this cargo\ncaptain transfer complete

think the captain wants to know if you are ready to tell us why you came here\nthe answer is within him when his cognitive powers have sufficiently developed he will be able to articulate it\nyes i feel it too but dont you worry\nwhat\nyou\nwhat are you saying\nleave you are going to die no you cant sickbay this is counsellor troi i need the doctor in my quarters now ian ianno ian\nits ian hurry\nno\nian said hes the reason the ship is in danger\nyou must save him\nthen ian was right he was the cause\nhe is a life force entity when we passed each other in space he was curious about us

simulation\ngeordi your message said urgent\nmy watson\nah yes that does seem only fair\nhe can be reached at 221b bakerstreet\ncomputer select at random a mystery by sir arthur conan doyle where i will play sherlock holmes and lieutenant laforge will be doctor john watson\nexcellent\nholmes collected nothing neither trinkets nor thoughts which were not specifically significant to him\nthe emerald tiep in presented to holmes by queen victoria after he solved the theft of the bruce partington plans a copy of whitakers almanac which provided holmes the key to the secret code in the valley of fear the snuff box of wilhelm gotts lei g sieges mann van der rom stein\nprimarily as doctor watson you will keep a written record of everything is ay and do for later publication and the famous holmes violin he purchased this in a pawnshop in tottenham court road for fifty five shillings which he considered to be a very good investment\nmerely throwing myself into the part watson\nwatson we are about to have guests\nbe a goodfellow and answer that lets not keep the inspector waiting\nlestrade of course\nthen may i say your perturbation becomes you inspector lestrade whilst simultaneously affording me yet again the opportunity to serve queen and country\nabsolutely\nwatson pray continue inspector\ni believe you will find inspector that this emissary here works not for but against the king of bohemia and that photograph of the king and his mistress is to be used as blackmail further upon deeper reflection you will deduce as did i that\ngeordi where are you going geordi\nbut but geordi i was just about to reveal that the sir is in fact a madam\nto solve a sherlock holmes mystery\nthen i should have extended the sequence of events\nis that not exactly what we were doing\nam iso different from you doctor are you able to cease thinking on command\nare you suggesting that there is some value in losing\ni have read them all\ni accept your challenge doctor\nwe will return to the holodeck where i will dare it to defeat me and you madam are invited to be a witness\ncome watson\nthere i have instructed the computer to give us a sherlock holmes type problem but not one written specifically by sir arthur conan doyle\nexactly will that be sufficient doctor\nthis is no larger than the holodeck of course so the computer adjusts by placing images of more distant perspectives on the holodeck walls\nno it is ar use this way\nthe running youth was a ploy the real crime is here and the intended victim is that man mister jabez wilson employee of the redheaded league dupe of a gang of criminals\ni saw the plaque the home of the redheaded league and this rope dangling from the bell which enabled me to deduce that mister jabez wilson was headed here to meet a most distasteful and untimely demise from this\nreasoning from the general to the specific is that not the very definition of deduction is that not the way sherlock holmes worked\nfor whatever finds us my dear watson\nshe has been abducted\nthe good doctor\nwatson the doctor has been carried off by two men one is tall the other is shorter left handed and is employed in a laboratory\none set of footfalls are widely spaced the other is evenly spaced closer together further on the ground you can see the swirling scrapes made by his left shoe as he twists behind presumably to see if he is being followed left footed means left handed the dark colouring of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber a type of nonconductive soles used by researchers experimenting with electricity finally there can be no argument the game is a foot come watson\nhear that what do those footfalls tell you watson\nmore particularly that our opposition does indeed consist of two men and that one of them is carrying the bound and gagged doctor pulaski\nnot at all because we do not hear the doctors footfalls we must assume that she is being carried and since we do not hear her cries for help we know that she is gagged further both sets of footfalls are heavy and masculine one man seems to shuffle and stumble in an irregular pattern since the ground is level we must conclude that doctor pulaski is struggling against one of her captor sporadically knocking him offstride deduction pure and simple well not that simple\nthere they are again watson i dare say we have caught up rather nicely with our quarry\nthere should be a doorway\nthere is nothing here of relevance i do not see how this connects with the disappearance of the doctor\ndoctor kate pulaski but do not concern yourself inspector you have enough on your mind\nno look at his shoes hes more a convict released today from dartmoor prison he spent the day in a tavern consuming large quantities of gin with his killer who followed him to this spot and waited over there until the victim slipped into a drunken stupor then out of fear motivated only by self protection strangled him there is your killer inspector\nand when you check i believe you will find that this poor soul is the victims common law wife who has been dreading the release of this a vile and abusive man\nnot with her hands no but with this when used as a garrote these beads will leave marks quite similar to fingerprints and my dear watson you will note from the victims throat the marks are too evenly spaced to be have been made by human hands\nnot really inspector and now for strictly personal reasons i must leave come watson this murder does not connect with our case\nyes\ni do not know and that is what puzzles me\nno\nwe will find doctor pulaski in here\nit is the only obvious choice\nnot anymore he wants us to find him\nthe master criminal the man holmes could only defeat at the cost of his own life at reichenbach falls our adversary my dear watson is none other than professor moriarty himself\nand a trail which is so well marked that obviously we are meant to follow it\nno watson not a dead end at all hello whats this can you see the scratches\nprofessor moriarty i presume\nhe is the one worthy opponent created by the author conan doyle\nwhere is doctor pulaski\nshe would not have told you anything\nhave you injured her\nsay nothing\ncomputer exit\ncomputer execute complete shutdown of the holodeck\nexplain\nwe must see the captain\nthis\nhe does moriarty\nnor do i\nno she is in grave danger\ncaptain this character moriarty he called for the arch\nand perhaps our library files as well sir that level of information would be necessary in order to create a true adversary for me\nhe is still a fictional character sir originally programmed with nineteenth century knowledge\nonly time sir\ncaptain i believe that would place the doctor at risk it is probable our mortality failsafe has been overridden\nthere can be only one explanation in programming moriarty to defeat me not holmes he had to be able to acquire something which i possess\nconsciousness sir without it he could not defeat me\ni will change into my uniform sir\ncaptain\ncaptain this holographic image differs from any i have ever seen could he have actually injured you\nwe will find moriarty this way sir the warehouse\ncongratulations professor i capitulate to the betterman your victory sir is well earned\nshe believes it has already arrived not the starship my friend the original\nthis is my gift to the victory s captain zimba ta\ni served with him an ensign sure wish he d been in command of this victory wind and sail thats the proper way to move a ship\nthats exactly why this fascinates me data you see its human nature to love what we dont have simpler days huh anyway stringing this rigging has made me dream of handling sails\ndata the whole point in doing something like this is to make it by hand\nso it is while were waiting to rendezvous with victory we have time for me to be watson more properly your watson\nive just shown you one of my dreams now lets go and share in one of yours\nclancy ill be gone a while see that no one touches this\nlook at all of the detail so you say everything here has some significance\nthis\nall right data you solve the cases and get all the gifts what do i do\nin the hands of some the violin is a wondrous thing equally capable of stirring the soul to the heights of bliss as to the depths of despair but data thats incredible how can you play it like that\nbut in the hands of my friend mister sherlock holmes the violin ceases to be a musical instrument a tall and becomes\nhow could you possibly\ninspector who\ndata holmes really talked like that\ndamn havent they invented the electric light by now\ncomputer freeze programme exit\nim done\ndata what was the point in going to the holodeck\nexactly but you ve got them all memorised the first time someone opens their mouth you ve got it solved so there s really no mystery if theres no mystery theres no game no game no fun im not upset with you data really its just that we go through all the trouble to arrange the time to go down to the holodeck to get the proper wardrobe to get into character and then boom before we even get started you jump to the end you see i was looking forward to the mystery\no him not getting through the fun in the programme data was in the attempt to solve a mystery\nshes right data you always know the answer\ni dont know about that deductive reasoning is one of data s strengths\nnow your e just being unfair doctor\nmay be the computer could create one in the holmes style one where you wouldnt know the outcome\ngood for you data\nso this will be something new something created by the computer\nyour first visit to a holodeck doctor\nbut with the image so perfect you d have to touch the wall to know it was there and the computer fools you in other ways i say holmes where shall we head the theatre rules a concert perhaps\nwhatsover here data\nnow wait a minute doctor well see whose circuits short out\ncomputer arch\ncomputer override previous programme okay a programme that definitely challenges data\ncomputer in the holmes ian style create a mystery to confound data with an opponent who has the ability to defeat him\ncomputer wants to know how far to take the game\nnot he parameters will be whatever is necessary in order to accomplish the directive create an adversary capable of defeating data\ndata i mean holmes old boy what are we looking for\nwho has\ni think she s hiding shes going to lead you on a wildgoose chase and then recount the story to everyone between here and alpha centauri\nand how do you know that\nthat were on the right track\nnow you know all this because you read it in a holmes story right\nyeah come on\nwell holmes what do you say man\ninspector perhaps i can be of assistance as i take note of this deadman i deduce that he was strangled you see the finger marks on his throat indicate the cause of death and as there are signs of struggle its quite obvious that his murderer was a stranger who attacked him from behind\nholmes the poor woman hardly has the strength to strangle a man this size\ndata wait if this murder isnt connected to the disappearance of doctor pulaski then the computer is running an independent programme\nwhy\nthen you dont know whats going to happen next\nthats what i want to hear where to now\nhow do you know that\nwhy is the obvious choice all of a sudden the right one i mean isnt this a game of misdirection\nwho does\nnow this is getting interesting\ntheres nothing here but these barrels\noh no data its another dead end\nthe doctor was right finally we have a game worthplaying\nhow do you know that\ndata what does he mean how does he know were not who we appear to be\ndata\ndata this isnt right a holographic image should not be able to call for the arch\ndata data wait\ndata wait data\ndata data will you please tell me whats going on\nits still running the programme didnt shutdown\ndata wait what is it whats on that paper and why cant we shut down the holodeck data\nthis is impossible how can a character from 1890s london draw a picture of the enterprise whos got control of the computer\nthat is impossible i dont understand\ndata wait what about the doctor is she all right in there\nme\nwell doctor pulaski and i had a discussion about whether data could solve an original holmes type mystery\nyes with a worthy opponent\nohmygod i asked for a holmes type mystery with an opponent capable of defeating data that got to be it\ncaptain im sorry\nusing waveguides i could split a particle stream out of the matter antimatter chamber and route it down through existing conduit into the holodeck if accelerated to sufficient velocity that would quite literally wash away all present holographic constructs the london buildings the streets the people all gone including moriarty\nyes sir she cracked as par when the enterprise was shaken otherwise i think she weather edit quite nicely\nyes sir thank you sir its just that i cant help thinking how what else might have happened all because i misspoke a single word\nbristol fashion sir\nyes sir\nyes sir\nholmes are you there man\nthank the almighty your e available today holmes im in a deuce of a dilemma\nwe need your help holmes you see this gentleman here the emissary of a foreign government has been the victim of a most accidentally wicked crime\nwhat dear fellow\nto put the matter simply holmes this man was accosted by gypsies intent on depriving him of his most valuable possessions and in the process of picking his pockets clean they also happened to bag a photograph this man was carrying\ngreat scott the photograph\nholmes thank god your e here\nmake way please make way make way for sherlock holmes its murder holmes murder most foul\ndoctor doctor watson is right here holmes\nshe was with you\nis that correct holmes\nseize her\nastounding holmes\ncome along hurry it up come on\npie spies some are me at some are sweet\nstop him stop him he stole my goods\nii feel like a newman that dark fellow there used the word arch and then i wonder arch\nwhat have we here\nwhat are you\nnot at this time\nthe best kind im sure but i need information\nthe time for games is over\nand like the spider i feel the strings vibrate whenever anyone new chances into my web welcome my dear holmes but not holmes and doctor watson but not watson\nshes here\nshe has provided many answers do you forget i have always been your equal dear holmes i have read her expressions what she has not said is as important as her words\ni will if necessary but my mind is crowded with images thoughts i do not understand yet can not purge they plague me you and your associate look and act so oddly yet though i have never met nor seen the like of either of you i am familiar with you both its very confusing i have felt new realities at the edge of my consciousness readying to break through surely holmes if thats who you truly are you of all people can appreciate what i mean\ni know there is a great power called computer wiser than the oracle at delphi a power which controls all of this and to which we can speak arch\nit has described a great monstrous shape on which i am like a fly stuck on a turtles back adrift in a great emptiness what is this holmes\nwhy does it frighten you holmes\nim not sure now dear lady will that be one lump or two\nmilk of course\nmister computer proposes the incredible thought that we are all travelling in a great vessel of some sort is that true\nthe scones are likewise a must\nstrange it actually pleases me to hear you say that\nyour e not frightened of me\nyou should be mister computer the arch please a few more questions mister computer\ni just cant seem to remember that last command ah well sooner or later itll all come to me but in the meantime i have decided to approach the problem from a more familiar perspective theres really no reason why i shouldnt be able to use some of the knowledge from my world in order to bring me closer to yours\nof course you do madam the more you proclaim your ignorance the more you try to mislead me the more iam on to you your every silence speaks volumes\nwhere back to here\nin time in time i will leave all of this and join you out there or is this where we both are right now\nfrankly now i want nothing more than what the fisherman expects of the worm you dear doctor will be the lure and this will be the hook for your captain jean luc picard\nhow well you know\ncaptain picard\nima civilised abductor captain picard civilised but still dangerous\nits gone beyond that little game mister data and youll note i no longer call you holmes whatever i was when this began i have grown i am understanding more and more and i am able to use the power at my finger tips i can affect this vessel and i can inflict bodily harm on you and on your doctor\nthe same thing you want for yourself to continue to exist if i destroy these surroundings this vessel can you say it doesnt matter to you interesting pun dont you agree for matter is what i am not the computer has taught me that i am made up only of energy\nand if i step off this holodeck\na holographic image i know but are you sure\ndoes he have life hesa machine but is that all he is\nexactly is the definition of life cogito ergo sum i think therefore i am\nit is the most important one and for me the only one that matters you or someone asked your computer to programme a nefarious fictional character from nineteenth century london and that is how i arrived but i am no longer that creation i am no longer that evil character i have changed i am alive and i am aware of my own consciousness\ni want my existence i want it out there just as you have yours\nthen you must murder me captain\nbecause you do not know how to convert holodeck matter into a more permanent form\na pity what i have seen what i have learned fascinates mei do not want to die\nmadam i have enjoyed your company computer arch cancel override protocol return control of the holodeck to main computer my fate is in your hands as perhaps it always was\nhow well i know\nthen perhaps well meet again someday madam\nbut ill still fill you with crumpets madam ide test long

running\ndata shall we go gentlemen open\nwe dont have much time he s getting more control of his environment lets see if we cant be at professor moriarty by giving him everything he wants\nobviously hes trying to alter the programming here\ntuppence twopence supposed to be good luck we may need some\nexcuse me\ndata\nits more serious than that i think the mortality failsafe may have been circumvented he could ve killed me\ndata let him go\nyou all right\nmoriarty you were conjured up to attempt to defeat holmes here once that attempt is concluded win or lose your programme has run its course your existence is done\nyes you can do that but you havent i suspect you shook this ship in order to get my attention well now you have it what is it you want\nthat may not be entirely true professor this which we call the holodeck uses a principle similar to another device called a transporter in the year in which we live humans have discovered that energy and matter are interchangeable in the holodeck energy is converted to matter thus you have substance but only here\nyou are not alive as i said before you are only\noh yes\nno he is more\nyes that is one possible definition\nmoriarty my responsibility is this vessel and its crew\nthat may not be possible\ni can not give you what you want\nyes that is so\nand i do not want to kill you\nbridge this is the

emotion buried in your psyche\nexactly what are you feeling\nsome of it\nid like that\nwill he be with us\ni look forward to that time\nyes\nive grown so accustomed to iti forget its there\nhow do we communicate i know you can read lips but i need your words\nwords are here on top whats under them their meaning is whats important yes thats true we both know how to express important words like dream being here with you yes being here with you know is very special to me too\nthey need you on the bridge now\nriva go slowly slowly\nthe same hes withdrawn hes very frightened all of his life hes been in control and now for the first time he doesnt have any answers the doctor gave him a complete medical examination\ni dont know what we can do to help him\nits up to him and hes stopped cooperating\nconfidence is faith in oneself it cant easily be given by another\ndont turn away you have a chance to make some good come out of this tragedy this could be the catalyst which binds them together\nthe solar i need you\nthe captain is going to take you to ramat is but first hes given me permission to attempt to settle the conflict down on sola is yes weve come so far and paid such a terrible price i must try help me\ni have never attempted anything like this before when dealing with two factions so diametrically opposed so entrenched in their positions where do you start\ni want to know anything you can tell me that could help\nwhat about your chorus\nso there was a trick\nthats very hard to accomplish\nthis isnt going to be easy for me\nbut what i do is different\nwhy cant you do that why cant you turn your disadvantage into an advantage\nriva is going to teach them sign language\nwhile they are learning how to communicate with riva they ll be learning how to communicate with each other\ntime well spent\nyou wanted to see me\ngreetings\nyou have no jurisdiction here picard where is riva\nreducing velocity to one half impulse\nstandard orbit\ncourse is set\nwarp eight aye\nyes sir\nwere approaching sola is five\nslowing to one half impulse\ncoordinates set commander riker\nplease come closer before i start is there anything you need food refreshments\ni have been expecting you\nprecisely our way of communicating has developed over the centuries and its one that i find quite harmonious\nis deaf\nborn and hope to die\niam that which binds all the others together i am harmony wisdom balance\nthe gene for hearing is not present in my planets ruling line\nmany of the galaxy s greatest contributors have been similarly special\nwhat is that your e wearing\nand without it can you see\nthen your visor serves the same function as my chorus which interprets my thoughts and translates them into sound\nits a blessing to understand we are special each in his own way\nthank you\nat times like this we become an encumbrance\nthen thankyou for your time and effort\nif you will excuse me\ni am riva\nbe at ease i commend you both to come here proves not only your courage but your wisdom please give this conference a chance\ncoordinates have been input sir\nno\ni am not expecting battle\nriva\nbefore him there was no klingon word for peacemaker\naye sir\nsir\nwith your permission captain\nenterprise this is the away teams even to beam up\ncaptain im reading laser activity on the sola is five\nit is localised but very intense\nim receiving one side only\nthe other faction is breaking through sir2\nthe quality of the transmission is very poor\nthe laser fire has ceased\nyes sir\ntheyre coming commander\ninteresting a technique of communication which is both silent and covert it could be very useful\nthere are no life signs in the immediate area\nthe area is clear commander",

am trying to do sir but the solution eludes me\nintriguing it describes the empire as being highly advanced and powerful and capable of actually moving stars\ncorrect sir outposts the planet below was possibly one of them\ntheir sun went supernova sir\nthis planet may have been the most distant outpost sir but it shows no lifeform readings\nyankee trader\nespecially in view of the fact the image he transmitted sir was somehow distorted\nwith this power drain we may have trouble communicating with the enterprise sir\ndue to this forcefield there is presently no way to beam us back sir\nmost

finally beginning to understand what my eyes have been showing me its patterns of force everywhere this entire planet has been turned into a power accumulator\nits the whole point of this place i can see the planets power emanating from commander\nsomething to write home about data thats very human\nif he moves kill him\nwe will accuse the humans of preparing to ambush us it will be our word

that they do\nyes you show wisdom\nwhat of our vessel we knew the same answer\nlet ek has what weve done broken our agreement with their captain\nhideous monsters\nis this a female\nsickening\nand

gave chase in order to recover a federation owned energy device which\non the contrary gamma tauri four is recognised by all civilised members of\nall im saying is that you removed something which

as doctor kingsley said they should be evacuated i would like to bring one of them aboard within a force field for a complete examination\nexactly and we wont know until we begin gathering data

right\ni realise that captain naturally well establish a force field containment\nwe dont have that kind of time these children cant survive in the lab once their parents are dead look at him captain hesa human being who needs our help\nminimal\ndeanna do you have a minute youve known the captain for sometime i think i need some advice i dont seem to be dealing with him very well\nwell my

react\neven at a distance\ndestroyit how exactly\ncommander i want an analysis of the interaction between the thel us ian flu and the children\nnot necessarily commander data has away with computers\ncommander what have you got\nand since our is self replicating the process\njudging from what happened on the lan tree anyone is a carrier once they re infected\nim afraid so captain the children dont carry the disease they are the cause\ntheir advanced immune system has created an antibody that changes normal dna the altered genes are the ones that control aging\nthe enclosed

are just about out of time\ncaptain i appreciate what your e trying to do but i got into this by leaping before i looked and i wont allow you to make the same mistake chief medical officers log this will be my final report to the enterprise just as changes in evolution are known to be caused by changes in the environment we now know the process also works in reverse an attempt to control human

klingon hull at this time\nit will take some time to locate them sir they are on undesignated manoeuvres in the phebe n system\nslow to impulse\nthe pag his either cloaked or destroyed sir\nconsidering the absence of debris captain it is reasonable to assume the klingon vessel is in the area and cloaked\nand since we do not know its intent i recommend we go to red alert\nhes only dazed sir\nit has all armament locked on us and ready to fire\nthis is captain karg an of the klingon vessel the pa gh beam your first officer on board immediately\nthankyou for your opinion but i will judge that for myself screen off\nthat is incorrect\nyou are commander william riker first officer of the klingon cruiser the pa gh or do you intend to disobey federation orders\nexactly where are your loyalties commander\nthis ship is equipped with our best weapons and our finest warriors although we are on a peaceful mission we are ready to go into battle instantly i know i can count on every klingon warrior in this crew to serve and die in that battle so i ask you again commander riker where are your loyalties\nwill you take an oath to that effect\nspeak in their language this is your second officer lieutenant k lag\ni would say it your first command decision\nand you commander riker will obey my orders\ntell me commander riker what do you make of this\nno no collision\nno not corrosion\nwe already have and fortunately the cavity opened on to a section that could withstand the change in pressure\nim afraid not\nthe only vessel weve had contact with recently is the enterprise\ntactics officer report to commander riker\nwhat type of beam did the enterprise use to cause this damage in our hull\nexplain that\nwhy is no longer important what is important is our response to this attack engage cloaking device change course to intercept the enterprise\nintend there is only one response i intend to attack the enterprise and destroy it\nwhat is the status\ncommander riker check the organism growth with engineering\nkeep him under scrutiny\nbecause he was ordered to\nits the expectation of any officer to be ordered to die at anytime\nthat only proves that he is intelligent and you might not be as strong as you used to be\nso soon\nyou almost had me believing this was a misunderstanding\nthe enterprise has changed course and is following us why\nthe reason is obvious their intent is clear how long before we make contact\nput the ship on full battle alert arm all photon torpedoes let them charge into their destruction\nhold your position let them come to us\ndo not forget my rank\ni understand fully now you understand i am still captain of this vessel and you are still crew and sworn to obey me you gave me your oath\nthen fulfill that oath and serve this ship as you swore to tell me of the surest method of attack against the enterprise\nyou must it is a matter of honour and loyalty to your oath\nif your word is no good then how can we ever trust starfleet\nthey are in conflict\nif you had told those secrets about the enterprise i would have labeled you a traitor and killed you where you stood but instead you will die with us youll die like a klingon\ni do not believe them arm all weapons prepare to attack captains log stardate 425078 although our search has been extensive we are still unable to locate the klingon ship or any evidence of its destruction\nthen they are fools for we will\nwell only need one standby on phasers and torpedoes prepare to fire them simultaneously\nyou will give the order to fire commander

good you did some research on our nutritional choices\ngag his always best when served live would you like something easier\nyes if klingon food is too strong for you perhaps we could get one of the females to breastfeed you\nlook around you there are no old warriors\nexactly you may live long enough to learn about us\nthem\nyes\ncommander would you say your e a typical federation officer\nwell its just your e not what i expected\nyou should ask\nquestions about what about our future our future is honour our present is serving this ship\nmy father my father was captured in battle by romulans and not allowed to die he eventually escaped\nhe is on our planet he waits\nhe will eventually fade of a natural illness and die weakened and useless honour less i will not see him\na klingon is his work not his family that is the way of things\nklingons do not express feeling the way you do\nwe would not know how\na space organism eating away at our hull\nour estimate is that in less than eight hours we will have lost too much of our shell to remain intact\ncaptain im not convinced riker knew of any plot against us if he did why would he have come on board\nto die\nfor a klingon perhaps but rikers people do not volunteer for death so easily he may be a spy but he sno coward\nthe enterprise has changed hailing messages they now include a promise of cleaning the organisms and helping in repairs\nwhy\nyou are honouring your promise to serve us\nfifty five thousand kilometres and closing\nforty thousand kilometres\nyes captain you understand the klingons better than i thought commander\ni am not mor doc i am mendon ensign mendon from the planet benz ar\nwe are from the same geo structure naturally we look alike\nwe just do\ni want to tell you how happy i am to be assigned to the enterprise it wasnt just luck i request edit i know i can be of great help to the ship\nyes sir\nthats a wonderful method of maintaining a constant control factor over defensive shields but im sure theres a way to improve response time sorry didnt mean to interrupt you just thought i could be of some help however i am correct in what is aid\nthat is superb designing absolutely first rate\nthe input sampling its simple yet efficient enough of course a minor change of the helm readout would be much more helpful in emergency situations\nnot in a practical exercise but in theory my theory it would be more than a marginal improvement ill have to mention this to the captain he is open to some astute observations isn the\noutstanding soon well get things running perfectly\nnot very hospitable are they\ndidnt mean to offend you\nsiria men sign mendon i just wanted to tell you how please diam to be aboard the enterprise\nif you have a few minutes ive noted a few procedural items which might speed up operations on the bridge i pick things up very fast\ni beg your pardon captain i just wanted to impress upon you\nive located it sir the dorsal of the engineering section\ncaptain i noticed it when i did an intensive scan of the pa gh the klingon ship\nno one i have not yet completed my full analysis\nbut sir as is aid i have not yet completed my full analysis it would be improper to report it until then\nit is a benz it e regulation no officer on the deck of one of our ships would report an occurrence like this until he had a full analysis and a resolution i have simply followed proper procedures\nyes sir\nyes captain that will take a couple of hours\nit is confirmed that the organisms feed on some of the compounds that make up the hull of the enterprise\nthey are much more susceptible their hull contains more of the compounds\nthank you but i seem to have become efficient a little later than was needed it was my responsibility to learn and adapt to the enterprises regulations and i didnt do that\ni failed i had an opportunity to show the captain my superior capabilities and i failed i can never recover from that\ni realise your e trying to be nice to me and i appreciate it what i dont understand is why\nthankyou i only hope i can learn your ways before i mess up again i imagine my methods must seem foolish to you\nyour e right ill do it your way ill work even harder than i did before and ill succeed brilliantly\nsiri have something to report to you immediately\ni have managed to isolate the organisms on our hull they are a submicron form capable of breaking nuclear bonds in the tr itanium plating\nyes they are controllable and can be removed from the hulls of both ships by using a tunnelling neutrino beam\nacknowledged captain\ngood luck commander\ni wouldnt want to go\nyour e not afraid are you\ni would be ready sir\nyes captain were not yet in safe range for a transfer\nand defensive shields are still in place\nyes sir ill wait till forty thousand\naye sir\nacknowledged number one\ncommander riker report to the phaser range please\ni was wondering if you had any feelings about the officer exchange programme initiated by starfleet command\nwell thats a benz it e trait its been suggested that an officer from the enterprise might participate in the programme\nwell there is a klingon vessel in the area\nnon on either have i\nhaving worf on board certainly has been\ni thought of asking for a volunteer\ndamn sorry number one what was that\nany particular reason\nill notify starbase of your acceptance theyll contact the klingon vessel make the arrangements captains log stardate 425065 we have departed from starbase one seven nine and are headed for a rendezvous with the klingon vessel pag hi have informed the staff of commander rikers temporary assignment\nwell im familiar with the practice of the feast before the transfer ive done it dozens of times however i usually made more palatable choices\nthankyou

did you inform\nand i think that falls into this category\nit is our procedure ensign to notify command of any possibility of danger to the ship the decision is not yours do you understand\nnow you

federation officer serving ever on a klingon vessel\nit might prove to be beneficial\nyes sir who did you intend to send sir\ni might be interested sir\nis aid i wouldnt mind the assignment sir\nbecause nobody s ever done it before\nthen your e just the person i need to talk to clear something up its my understanding that one of the duties of the first officer of a klingon ship is to assassinate his captain\nwouldnt that bring about chaos\nthe method of attrition must take a little getting used to\nit is different\nits a klingon delicacy pipi usc law this is heart of targ this of

average everyday human who happens to be a commander now what were your orders\nproceed\ncommander william riker of the starship enterprise\ni dont understand\ni have no such intention sir\nim afraid i still dont understand sir\ni have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders and i will do exactly that\ni just did\nis there something you wanted to say to me lieutenant\nthen i take it you challenge my authority over you\nand your position on this captain\nmy oath is between captain karg an and myself your only concern is with how you obey my orders or do you prefer the rank of

enterprise\nthats normal procedure\nnone why would they do that were allies\ni cant\nits no weapon the enterprise has no reason to do that especially with me on board it makes no sense why\nwhat do you intend to do captain\nbut\nask them\nthey may be here to help you dont be a fool\ni havent i am simply trying to help you understand\nyes sir i did\ni wont\ni will not surrender the secrets of the enterprise to you\ni will not break any vowi have taken in the past i have also taken an oath a loyalty to your ship i will not break that\nno sir they are not i will obey your orders i will serve this ship as first officer and in an attack against the enterprise i will die along with this crew but i will not break my oath of loyalty to starfleet\ni told you theyre here to help\nthats normal procedure when entering into a suspicious situation its not an act of aggression the enterprise will not fire first\nyoull get only one shot\ni recommend you dont fire until your e within forty thousand kilometres\nit will cut down their response time\nwould you do less\ntheres one thing id like to say i question your judgment in my opinion your reason for forcing this confrontation is not valid\nyes sir\nno sir\nhold where you are kla give relieved captain karg an he was acting in an irrational manner im your captain now serve this ship as i have\ncloaking shields off obey my

are fit\nof course\ndata is not sentient no\nintelligence self awareness consciousness\nthis is absurd we all know your e sentient\nthats right\nwell you are self aware\nyes it has the ability to learn and understand and to cope with new situations\nyes\nbecause you are conscious of your existence and actions you are aware of yourself and your own ego\nthis is exceedingly difficult\ni dont know it well enough to like or dislike it\noh yes its an extraordinary piece of\nyes\nyes\nso that i can learn from it and construct more\nas many as are needed hundreds thousands if necessary there is no limit\ni dont understand\na machine\nyes\ni will cancel that transfer order\nhes remarkable\ncaptain picard phillipa\ncaptain lou vois your e acquainted with captain picard\ncaptain its good to see you again\nmay i present commander bruce maddox\nhe has an interesting proposal for you but that can wait for awhile im eager to see the enterprise\nas you know weve had disturbing news from both sides of the zone were here to respond when needed and it wont hurt to have the romulans know that were nearby well captain i want to thank you for this opportunity for five hundred years every ship that has borne the name of the enterprise has been a legend this one is no different\noh yes captain commander maddox is here to do some work on your android please take care of him\nhold it thats my chair my luck is always lousy unless i start on the dealers right\nbitter experience has taught me its a fundamental truth\ntime to pluck a pigeon\nsee that\nsame riker\ntoo rich for me\nbusta chair across my teeth\na int love wonderful\ni am in charge of the twenty third sector office were brand new i have no staff but one terrified little ensign hopefully we can make some good law out here\nstill the most exciting and worthwhile place to be\nthey forced me out\nwhen i prosecuted you in the stargazer court martial i was doing my job\nnot true a court martial is standard procedure when a ship is lost i was doing my duty as an officer of the judge advocate general\nyou know i never thought i would say this but its good to see you again it brings a sense of order and stability to my universe to know that your e still a pompous ass and a damn sexy man\noh yes were old friends excuse me picard call me you can buy me dinner\nmy god twice in as many days\nan historic moment\nhe can refuse to undergo the procedure but we cant stop the transfer\nwe agree to certain risks when we join starfleet\nall this passion over a machine\nthere is always an option he can resign\nso you came to me for help\nwait i didnt mean it that way im glad that you felt you could well come to me\ni wish things were different\novert sentimentality is not one of captain pi cards failings trust me i know\nlook your e preaching to the choir here why dont you get to the point\nwe have rule of law in this federation you ca not simply seize people and experiment with them to prove your pet theories\nthats an interesting point but the enterprise computer is property is data\nthere may be law to support this position\ni have completed my research based on the acts of cumberland passed in the early twenty first century data is the property of starfleet he can not resign and he can not refuse to cooperate with commander maddox\nthen i shall be required to hold a hearing\ncaptain that would be exceedingly difficult this is a new base i have no staff\nthere are i can use serving officers as legal counsel you as the senior officer would defend\nand the unenviable task of prosecuting this case would fall on you commander as the next most senior officer of the defendants ship\nwhen people of good conscience have an honest dispute we must still sometimes resort to this kind of adversarial system\nthen i will rule summarily based upon my findings data is a toaster have him report to commander maddox immediately for experimental refit\ngood and i expect you to do your duty in that courtroom if i find for one minute that you are not doing your best i will end this then and there\ni have never forgotten it not then and certainly not now\nthis hearing convened on stardate 425274is to determine the legal status of the android known as data the office of the judge advocate general has rendered a finding of property the defence has challenged commander riker\nsustained\nproceed commander\nim afraid i cant agree captain proceed with you demonstration commander\nproceed commander\ngranted\ncommander riker do you want to cross\nthankyou you may step down\nit sits there looking at me and i dont know what it is this case has dealt with metaphysics with questions best left to saints and philosophers im neither competent nor qualified to answer those ive got to make a ruling to try to speak to the future is data a machine yes is he the property of starfleet no we have all been dancing around the basic issue does data have a soul i dont know that he has i dont know that i have but i have got to give him the freedom to explore that question himself it is the ruling of this court that lieutenant commander data has the freedom to choose\nyou didnt call him it\nyou see sometimes it does work\nyou buying\nmy god phillip alou vois and back in uniform its been ten years but seeing you again like this makes it seem like fifty if we were nt around all these people do you know what i would like to do\nafter that\nso what are you doing out here\nanything is possible so you came back to starfleet\nyou had no reason to leave\nno that was your own damn stubborn pride\noh you did more than your job you enjoyed it\nyou always enjoyed the adversarial process more than arriving at the truth well i hope you ve learned a little wisdom along the way\nadmiral\ncommander\nyes sir this way\ni was a little surprised at the decision to put a base in force so close to the neutral zone\nthe two of you are acquainted\nwhat exactly will this work entail\nall right explain this procedure\ndata\nwhat are the risks to commander data\ncommander data is a valued member of my bridge crew based on what ive heard i can not allow commander data to submit himself to this experiment\ncome\ndata please sit down well we have a problem\nyour service to this ship has been exemplary i dont want to lose you\ndata i understand your objections but i have to consider starfleet s interests what if commander maddox is correct there is a possibility that many more beings like yourself could be constructed\nthat will be all mister data\ncomputer pull all relevant information with regard to starfleet regulations on the transfer of officers\ni need your help\ni have been trying to make sense of this gobbledygook but its beyond me the fact is my android officer data is being transferred compulsorily to be made part of a highly dangerous ill conceived experiment and i want it stopped\nonce this maddox has got control of data anything could happen i dont trust that man\nyes acceptable risks justified risks but i cant accept this its unjustified its unfair he has rights\ndont start this is important to me is there an option\ni see\nyes i came to you youre the officer for this sector i had no choice but to come to you\nthe word trust just isnt in your vocabulary is it good try nine out often for effort\ni wish i could believe that\nirrational\ni will tell you again data is a valued member of my crew he is an outstanding bridge officer\ndata is a starfleet officer he still has certain rights\nthank you\ncommander who do you think you reworking for starfleet is not an organisation that ignores its own regulations when they become inconvenient whether you like it or not data does have rights\nthen find it a ruling with such broad ranging implications must be supported phillipa i hope you will use the same zeal that you did in the stargazer court martial\nwhat if i challenge this ruling\nthen iso challenge convene your hearing\nbut surely captain you have regulations to take care of such an eventuality\nvery good\nyou dont have to remind us of our duty you just remember yours\ncome\ndata captain lou vois has issued a ruling you are the property of starfleet command you can not resign\ndata your e not going to submit were going to fight this i challenged the ruling captain lou vois will be compelled to hold a hearing she may be overly attached to the letter of the law but i suspect that she still understands its spirit we will put to rest this question of your legal status once and for all now i have been asked to represent you but if there is some other officer with which you would feel more happy\nobjection your honour i want this read all of it\nobjection there are many life forms possessed of mega strength these issues are not relevant to this hearing\nobjection it doesnt matter objection withdrawn\ni request a recess\nrikers presentation was devastating he almost convinced me\nthats true\nive had to send people on far more dangerous missions\noh yes no doubt\nin ways that i can not even begin to calculate\nin what way\nyour e talking about slavery\ni dont think thats a little harsh i think thats the truth but thats a truth we have obscured behind a comfortable easy euphemism property but thats not the issue at all is it\ncommander riker has dramatically demonstrated to this court that lieutenant commander data is a machine do we deny that no because it is not relevant we too are machines just machines of a different type commander riker has also reminded us that lieutenant commander data was created by a human do we deny that no again it is not relevant children are created from the building blocks of their parents dna are they property i call lieutenant commander data to the stand\nwhat are these\nwhy do you pack them what logical purpose do they serve\nand this\nyou value it\nwhy\nand this you have no other portraits of your fellow crew members why this person\nunder the circumstances i dont think tasha would mind\nthank you commander i have no further questions for this witness\ni call to the stand commander bruce maddox as a hostile witness\nyes yes yes suffice it to say he san expert commander is your contention that lieutenant commander data is not a sentient being and therefore not entitled to all the rights reserved for all life forms within this federation\ncommander would you enlighten us what is required for sentience\nprove to the court that i am sentient\nso i am sentient but data is not\nwhy why ami sentient\nah thats the second of your criteria lets deal with the first intelligence is commander data intelligent\nlike this hearing\nwhat about self awareness what does that mean why ami self aware\ncommander data what are you doing now\nand whats at stake\nmy rights my status my right to choose my life it seems reasonably self aware to me commander im waiting\ndo you like commander data\nbut you admire him\nengineering and programming yes you have said that commander you have devoted your life to the study of cybernetics in general\nand commander data in particular\nand now you propose to dismantle him\nhow many more\na single data and forgive me commander is a curiosity a wonder even but thousands of data s isnt that becoming a race and wont we be judged by how we treat that race now tell me commander what is data\nwhat is he\nis he are you sure\nyou see hes met two of your three criteria for sentience so what if he meets the third consciousness in even the smallest degree what is he then i dont know do you do you do you well thats the question you have to answer your honour the courtroom is a crucible init we burn away irrelevancies until we are left with a pure product the truth for all time now sooner or later this man or others like him will succeed in replicating commander data and the decision you reach here today will determine how we will regard this creation of our genius it will reveal the kind of a people we are what he is destined to be it will reach far beyond this courtroom and this one android it could significantly redefine the boundaries of personal liberty and freedom expanding them for some savagely curtailing them for others are you prepared to condemn him and all who come after him to servitude and slavery your honour starfleet was founded to seek out new life well there its its waiting you wanted a chance to make law well here it is make a good one\nphillip a dinner\nfive\nfold\ninstinct data instinct the game is seven card high low with a buy on

after her birth a federation ship brought her and her governess to kla vdi a three so that she could be raised in a neutral environment\nit is hoped she will unite the factions and bring peace\nwhat puzzles me captain is how she is expected to bring peace to dale d four its inhabitants have been fighting throughout their recorded history\nonly that it is the difference between night and day\ndid i what i meant sir is that dale d four rotates only once per revolution therefore one side is constantly dark and the other side constantly light one might surmise that the two hemispheres have

sir quickly\nthank you sir if that thing had managed to scan us we never would have had any chance of saving the enterprise\nthat probe was a transmitter sending an alien computer programme the same programme that is currently aboard the enterprise trying to rewrite our software in its own image we have two completely incompatible computer systems trying to interact\nyes\nnot very much the iconian programme is so sophisticated i may never understand it\nyes but only inasmuch as it was the probe that transmitted the programme\nthe programme affected all of the yamato s systems simultaneously but with us it was deposited within a specific section of our mainframe so its having to work its way out from that location that gives us a little breathing space\ncaptain the enterprise computer system is a lot like our own bodies with voluntary and involuntary system now probably ninety percent of what happens on this ship is done automatically completely out of our control were sitting on a bomb that could go off any second or maybe never\ndamn\nno go let me see if i can directly access the master programme\ndata\nwhat happened\nthanks data i noticed\ni dont

self correcting mechanism\nits constantly kicking in to make minute adjustments in the positronic brain\nokay give me a second to think there was an incompatible programme running through data s system so the mechanism started searching for a way to keep him alive the solution the solution was a shut down and a total wipe of all affected memory\ni dont see why not but it will have to be a complete shutdown we turn her off and effect a wipe of the yamato log including every subsequent event since we downloaded i till then be able to reload all the ships programs from the protected

picard out\nenough answers i want answers not conjecture number one i want them at a staff meeting in one hour\nwait wait thats not possible\nexplain\nand so there is no evidence that a weapon was used\ntheorise what could have caused such a catastrophic malfunction\nknowing where the flaw is located can you isolate the problem and solve it\npull any personnel you can use\nif it is a design flaw were better to stay where we are and give geordi time to work on it or what happened to the yamato could happen to us\ncomputer access captain donald varley s personal log search parameter locate

that before\nengineering\nwhat progress on the matter antimatter scan\nwhen the yamato was probed where was she\nat warp factor eight\nthat cant be helped ensign lay in a course warp factor eight\nwere going to assume the yamato s mission\nperhaps prevent one\ncome\nyes of course well what is it wesley\nchina was thought to be only a myth until marcopolo travelled the reno the icon ians were certainly real sit down we know that three systems within this sector had a number of cultural similarities similarities which could only be explained by there being a single unifying influence\nprobably conquered\nperhaps ancient texts did speak of demons of air and darkness\nlegend has it that they travelled without the benefit of spaceships merely appearing out of thin air on distant planets\nwell we would appear magical to stoneage people\narchaeology has been a hobby since academy days but why dont we talk about what really brought you here\neasily ohno not easily we handle it because were trained to as you will be tea earl grey hot but if the time ever comes when the death of a single individual fails to move us\nnow that should not have happened captains log supplemental as happened with our sister ship the enterprise is being to experience a series of system failures so far they are random but i fear they could be early symptoms of what happened to the yamato\nengineering\nlieutenant\nare you making any progress toward solving our problems\nhow\nif it was the probe that explains the yamato but how do you account for the difficulties the enterprise is experiencing\nlieutenant are our problems likely to attain the seriousness of those on the yamato\nmister laforge time is the one thing which we do not have in abundance\nanalysis mister data\nwell mister data\nhow long ago\nmagnify\ncaptain varley died believing that it was\nshields up prepare a tractor beam mister laforge im going to assist you in your research a probe has been launched from icon i a\nim going to capture it\nworf target phasers\nfire\nwelcome to the bridge mister laforge\nwhat can you do\nand so the earlier probe was responsible for the yamato s destruction\nwhy didnt we suffered the same fate\nwe may never reach that point a variation of what happened to the yamato might destroy us first\nthe probe was launched from icon i a probably from an automated system there may be records near the launch site that could help us find a solution\nand ill lead it\nyes\nand we will have it again number one i have been studying the icon ians since i was a cadet i have to be the one to go the enterprise is yours\nwere aware of the risks energise\nkeep trying them communications are bound to be erratic\nnor would i mister worf\ni would not expect any judging from the severity of bombardment i doubt any icon ians survived well mister data lets see what sense we can make of this\nthis is very reminiscent of din asian\nis it possible that they could be branches of the same language family beginning with iconian\nrun a comparison using basic simple words from din asian dewan and icco bar see if we can reconstruct a common root language\ndata data data\nyes lets get on with it\ndemons of air and darkness indeed\na gateway\nbe careful\ndata that was very foolish\nno data you might not be able to get back and i cant risk losing you\nis this how the icon ians travelled crossing light years as easily as we would cross a room those places could be on worlds in distant sectors of the galaxy i think the icon ians might have outfoxed their enemies maybe they didnt all die in the bombardment some of them could have passed through this this is what varley feared this is what he died for\nthe romulans could use this technology as a weapon\nwe cant make that assumption the effect on the yamato was devastating but what if it was by accident not by design what im going to say may sound unscientific but standing on this soil breathing in this air my instincts tell me that we may have got them wrong\nbut that knowledge was passed down by the descendants of those who attacked this world the victors invariably write the history to their own advantage there is an unfortunate tendency in many cultures to fear what they do not understand its possible that their enemies confronted with this technology were driven to attack the icon ians out of fear\ni believe that it was gentlemen we have a way home\ndata can you hear me data respond\nhow bad is it\nhow long is the interval\nthe next time the enterprise appears go through it with data geordi will be able to learn from him may be help him\nthis will be the test\ndestroy the tricorder\nand that is precisely why it must be destroyed how long\nim running out of time we all are data data i have to destroy this this control room and its technology must not be allowed to fall into romulan hands\nhow how do i do it how do i destroy everything the control room the probes all of it\ni detonate it but how how do i do that\nprobes the probes launch i launch the probes but why whats goodwill that do\ndoors\nand if the doors are closed then the backwash from the rockets will spill into the power grids and there llbean overload\nbut the doors will open automatically when the launch begins and i will override\nwhich control keys damn of course you cant see\nworf help him up\nim standing directly in front of the gate to my left there is a small triangular screen\nright now to my right is a larger triangular screen the top is solid amber to the left red\nthats the launch sequence how doi override the doors\ni hope thats not a stutter i dont know how long a delay there will be between the launch and the detonation ill hold keying the launch sequence until your e through the gate how long until the enterprise reappears\nill go through the gate\nvery shortly anywhere will be preferable to this room mister worf i am depending on you you must getdataback to the enterprise he may be their only hope\noh no\nnot i think today commander\nbridge picard\ntake us out of here the romulan ship is set to auto destruct and they cant deactivate it\nwell number one i can

your people are able to help us malfunctions are becoming serious we lost an engineering team when the computer shut down a force field in an open shuttle bay eighteen people\nnone they are affecting every system simultaneously its like the ship has suddenly decided to fall apart its beginning to make me think we should have run these galaxy class ships across a few more drawing boards before we built one\ni dont know im grasping at straws here all i know is we ve got to get it fixed and before i lose more than an engineering team\nnono that would be premature\ni know what you rethinking whatthehell ami doing here well i had heard rumours about a couple of archaeological digs that started making the icon ians sound a lot less like legend i did a little investigating and i located their home world\nin the neutral zone\nthe risk would be in allowing the romulans to locate icon i a fortunately i got there first its a virtually dead planet but enough technology remains to give the romulans an edge if they should find it\npersonal log it was kind of doctor ramsey to allow me to carry away my own little piece of legend from the archaeological dig at deni us three my engineers have examined it but are completely baffled by its technology what was its purpose im like a caveman confronted by a tricorder im certain this device is iconian but how far had it travelled before it was abandoned on this alien world personal log a galactic rosetta stone the star fields on the artefact were unintelligible until i took into account two hundred millennia of stellar drift after that it was easy to pinpoint icon i a my first officer is questioning the wisdom of my order to violate the neutral zone but i am convinced that i have taken the only proper course should this advanced technology fall into the hands of the romulans we might as well dock our ships and defend ourselves with sticks personal log we ve been spotted by a romulan cruiser but after playing hide and seek through several solar systems i think ive managed to elude them the iconian probes can was it an attempt at communication if only i knew what we were dealing with here personal log im unable to send an away team to the surface of iconian or can i scan the energy source on the planet because of these maddening system failures its infuriating to be stopped at the threshold of a dream by ones own

ve been able to reactivate the shuttle and the onboard clock indicates that the shuttle is\nsix hours in front of us captain do you read me if the shuttles from six hours into the future then so is the other captain picard captains log supplemental part of the mystery has been solved the reason there are two number five shuttle crafts is because one of them is from the future six hours to be exact and so presumably is the facsimile of me\ncaptain weve retrieved all we are going to get from the shuttle logs including the last visual records everything before that is just a jumble\nthe distortion is because we had to use a phase inverter to retrieve the logs the quality will improve slightly\ncaptain we have a portion of the last log entry its audio only\nall attempts to obtain further information from the shuttle have failed\ni just dont understand how you could have ended up in a shuttlecraft while the enterprise was being destroyed\nwell the shuttle apparently came from somewhere up ahead so rather than continuing on this course maybe we should stop here and let whatever is out there come to us\nwhat are you saying that stopping turning right or left or even reversing our course would be pointless\nso when we reach that point whatever happened will happen again the enterprise will be destroyed the other picard will be sent back to meet with us and we do it all over again sounds like someone s idea of hell to me\nbridge this is lieutenant laforge\nthe pull on the enterprise is steady im having to hold the warp engines at thirty percent in order to

lets continue on course somewhere out there something will happen a decision will be made during the course of which i will be separated from the enterprise at the time the decision will seem to be

agree im just questioning the speed at which were moving\ni think thats a valid concern\nhe is a boy not a sword\nwes\nyou have trouble behind that door\nit sounds like you ve got everything under control\nwest he minute you walk through that door theyre your team you have nothing to prove you ve got the authority\nits up to you to hang on to it now you d better get in there and wes for whatever its worth i think your e going to do just fine captains log stardate 427373 it has been six weeks since our entrance into these lc undid rema sector each system has revealed the same disturbing geological upheavals on every planet\ni have a problem with that kind of rigidity it seems callous and even a little cowardly\nyes\nabsolutely\nmy emotions are involved data s friend is going to die that means something\ndoes that invalidate the emotion\nill buy that excuse were all jigging madly on the head of a pin anyway\nyes captain\nassuming her brain structure is similar to ours the memories would be stored chemically on the neurons of the cerebral cortex theyre also time dependent i would have to scan for age of the chemical links and try to find\nthe relevant neurons\nhellos arjen ka\nan elan in singer stone it sings a different song for each person\ns arjen ka were going to run a few scans just to be sure your e all right datas will be right here dont worry pulaski\nthis is to protect her as much asus\nto remember you and this ship would complicate her future she has to be the person she was born to be and youll remember\nid call that geological instability\nthis is geology not malevolence these planets live fast and diehard the question is why\ncaptain\nweve entered the first system i think you might want to come to the bridge\nspectacular and a little terrifying\nthe first long range reading magnification ten to the sixth\nand deadly the last unmanned probe showed a thriving ecosystem now theres nothing\nill need your advice and recommendations as you know ive been given the responsibility of overseeing wesleys education to further that goal i would like to put him in charge of the planetary mineral surveys\nthe game isnt big enough unless its cares you a little\nsooner or later hell have to feel the burden of command ensign crusher\nreport to the observation lounge\nwesley ive assigned you the command of the planetary mineral surveys\nyou may not thank me once you see how much work it entails assemble a team and take a look at the records on the dre ma quadrant theresa mystery here we ve got to solve it\nensign your e dismissed\nwell its free\nboth\nso who have you got so far\ncompletely irrelevant these people are professionals if theresa personality conflict youre in charge you settle it\nseeing the look on his face ill get you another drink two more\nthank you\nfamily emergency you dont look like a person who came here to relax\ndo you think you were right\nor you could have been intimidated its tough to tell other people what to do\nthe difference in ages between you and davies is not the issue here\ndo you think it might have something to do with ego\nwes responsibility and authority go hand in hand i know your e responsible now we ve got to teach you a little bit of authority one of the reasons you ve been given command is so you can make a few right decisions that will establish a pattern of success and help build self confidence if you dont trust your own judgment you dont belong in the command chair\nthen your e wrong its arrogant to think youll never make a mistake\nin your position its important to ask yourself one question what would picard do\nwell it doesnt matter once picard makes his decision does anyone question it\nand why not\nwhen you figure it out youll understand command im on my way i hope ive been able to help you let me know what you decide\nyour e welcome ill see you later\nwed be gods which were not if there is a cosmic plan is it not the height of hubris to think that we can or should interfere\ni think thats an option we should be considering\nwell that eliminates the possibility of fate\nwhat a perfectly vicious little circle\nwe found the reason for the geological instability\nsir data s out there right now monitoring the condition sondre ma four the situations become pretty desperate for his friend hes calculated the safest location on the planets surface you can guess why\nshes going to die theyre all going to die\nyes unless\nsir\nsounds like a plan lets get started\ncome on data\na whopping big one and you know it\nwhere would you say we are now sir\nobrien take a nap you didnt see any of this your e not involved\ndata you ve got ten minutes thats it if you meet anybody but s arjen ka\ndamn\nyou know what to do\nhell be here\nim sure mister data has a very good explanation\nwes sit down\nyou did a good jobim proud of you\nno\nis anybody out there\ndata data where are you why wont you answer are you angry me please please im so afraid data data where are you\ndata data you came data where have you been\nwe already have we ran when the tremors began\nmy father wouldnt let us take anything but i had to have my transmitter i knew you would come back and i didnt want you to find only silence the way i did\nno\nwhat are we going to do\nwhere are we going to the stars\ndont leave me here please dont leave me\nno data no im scared dont make me go\nno\nno data\nno just leave me alone i want data\nwhat are you doing\nand my parents and brothers\nyou did this for me\nyou have many different kinds of people here\nwhen i am bigger cani be on your ship\ni wish i could come with you now\ni know but i can still wish for it\nhello\nwhat is this\nwhat does it sing for you\nwhy not\nno ill just watch you and be impressed\nyou know i never particularly thought of you as an animal person\non the holodeck weve made that legend come true\nso you like horses for the romance\nnow i understand you dont want the comfort of a pet you want a companion\ni had a beta zoid kitten once my mother and the cat reacted badly to one another\nnoi prefer a mode of transportation that doesnt have a mind of its own\nwe become too involved in the thoughts and shifting passions of the beast we lose our way and get swept up in emotion\nleadership grows from self confidence which is also part of a starfleet officers education\nyou cant guide someone into adulthood the experiences are unique to each person whether we s succeeds or fails he will learn from the experience\nyes\nwhat have you done so far\nbut they re all much older than you are\nsometimes\nif there is a cosmic plan are we not a part of it our presence at this place at this moment in time could be a part of that fate\nits all right no ones going to hurt you\nwell just go and get a treat and then\ncome on it ll be all right\nsir thank you sir\nyes sir a team sir\ni know sir\ni understand sir\nill try not to disappoint you\nhi can i walk with you\ni need a little advice\nwalking or advice\nits about my team im considering so many factors im confusing myself\nwell ive broken down the task and picked the best people in those disciplines\nive got prix us in mineralogy and metallurgy alans and hildebrandt for volcanology and geomechanics i want davies for geochemistry but\nright and it makes me feel strange what do i do about personality conflicts\nso you not only have to understand the job you also have to be a ships counsellor\nwell thank you captains log stardate 426963 we are entering the second selc und i star system where acting ensign crusher will begin his planetary mineral survey the results of which may help unlock the geological puzzle wesley\nwesley crusher ive been put in charge of the planetary geological surveys and id like to have you on the team\ni have prix us and alans and hildebrandt\ni hadnt thought of that\nthanks but im pretty sure ill be all right\nhi doctor pulaski\nmy teams in there ive got to assign planets set a schedule\ni havent had to deal with them yet not together not professionally\nthats just cos commander riker says i do\ni agree nice job\ndidnt you tell me that uv absorptions like these are indicative of trak er deposits\nso dont you think we ought to run a nico spectrogram\ni think id still run a nico gram\ni know i know i dont want to do a half way job\nmay be your e right\ni didnt i need your advice yesterday when ensign davies turned in his geological survey i asked him to run a nico spectrogram he didnt agree\nyes i guess i could have just been picking nits\ni suppose i could have made it an order but how do you give orders to somebody older and more experienced then you\ni guess not\nno its just the opposite of ego everytime i try to give an order something inside me says what makes my judgment so superior to these peoples\nbut what if im wrong\nbut what if its something really important i mean not just a mineral survey what if someone dies because i made a mistake\nhed listen to everyones opinion then make his own decision but he s captain picard\nno way\nim not sure\nive made my decision im going to have davies run that ico gram thank you sir\nensign davies i want that ico spectrogram run on these lc undid rema system\ndre ma four has the largest deposit of dilithium or e ever recorded its also laid down in a very unusual pattern the crystals are growing to form perfectly aligned lattices\nthat is going to take a little more work\nwe think so\nthey should happen very quickly sir\nit worked we did it\nno thank you sir its going to be a long time before im qualified enough to sit here\nthank you sir does it get any easier\nokay\nis there any indication that this is the work of an unknown intelligence\nis this part of your regular

    "episode 4": "a pleasure siri appreciated receiving the specs\naye i have\nhes working on a school project before you begin there are some questions first tell us how you arrived\nsurely your e not saying its unexplainable\nhow could it its meaningless\nyes we might as well let him try it\nperhaps you could call it the kosinski scale\nwhat is it captain why are we at general quarters\nits also my fault captain i should have realised it wasnt kosinski\nbridge from transporter chief two from fearless are ready to beam over\naye sir\ncaptain captain we need help\ndont you see what s following us\nhow\nyes sir captains log anytime entry is meaningless we have no choice but to repeat the same warp experiment but wish one variation a principal part of this warp formula will be the thoughts of everyone aboard the enterprise we have no idea exactly how this works we understand only that the traveller makes use of this somehow it will be most important that those aboard avoid random thoughts that might change the reality of what were attempting to do\nim not certain yet\nhes dying\nrealistically it does not seem possible captains log supplemental our position is unknown and our only chance of returning to the known universe is a dying alien who is generally humanoid but with a physiology sufficiently different from our own to create medical problems in caring for him\ni dont know my equipment doesnt register his kind of life signs i would have to guess exhaustion fatigue\nim not sure\ni recommend we let him come around in his own time\nhe could die and with him any chance we have\nhes unconscious again\nwhatever you need from him you d better get it soon\nsir we put mister kosinski s specs into the computer and ran a controlled test on them there was no improvement in engine performance\nits off the scale sir\ncaptain no one has ever reversed engines at this velocity\nmalfunction i trust\ntwo million seven hundred thousand light years\nyou must sir our comparisons show it to be completely accurate\nwhich traveling subspace they should receive in fifty one years ten months nine weeks sixteen days\nsir\ncaptain were here why not avail ourselves of this opportunity for study there is a giant protostar here in the process of forming no other vessel has been out this far\naccording to the instruments sir our speed never exceeded warp one point five\nwhere none have gone before captains log stardate 412633 instead of returning to our own galaxy the enterprise has gone forward to a place in the universe which is uncharted and unknown our present position puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy\nwarp one point five sir which is what my instruments have read all along\nsleighride\nwarp five sir\nwhere is the captain please\na ships engines should be a concern of the ships captain\nto which you have no end of questions\nall approved and described in the starfleet communications now i would like to set up in the engine room immediately\nno need i know my way around starships\ninform the bridge i shall begin the first test in precisely fifteen minutes why is that child here\nin order to save myself time let me ask those questions for you you received the information which starfleet provided you fed it into your computer as precisely as humanly possible then you did a controlled test and then to your astonishment nothing happened so you said whats going on this doesnt work kosinski sa fraud you see i have had this conversation on other starfleet vessels before they didnt understand it why should you\nim saying im not a teacher nor do i wish to become one i have neither the inclination nor the time\ni dont think you understand this has already been approved by starfleet command\ni didnt know that was necessary\nperhaps i should speak to captain picard\nhow basic shall i be\nwould you get onto the auxiliary panel please\nin order to save time my assistant is going to lay in my base formulas more rapidly than any human being possibly could including even myself so here then in the simplest possible terms what i do now this warp drive system was tuned only in the grossest possible sense at least according to my standards what i do is specific thank you well sufficient to say for now these symbols\nview with me if you will this screen as we consider the following now is this merely mechanics or is it nature that we deal with in all of this and what else than nature are the elementals of space and time you are trained in the system you go in a straight line competent yes and perhaps even innovative in a minimalist way but what i do here is not the end of the process it is the beginning so what do i do go back to the fearless which i left with a more efficient warp drive than i found or do you cast off your ignorance and allow me to continue\nwhat do you mean le the him try it dont talk about me in the third person like im not standing right here\noh yes we might as well let him try it you are too generous boy boy dont play with that\ndo this one just like the last time nothing changes commander ill make my preliminary adjustments at warp one point five and complete them as we achieve warp four\nall right here we go\nwhat are you doing\ncaptain picardi presume\nthe truth is captain i made a mistake a wonderful incredible mistake\nas the power grew i applied the energy a symptomatically i anticipated some tilling but it didnt occur now that was my error using the bessel functions at the beginning\nive always suspected this rate of speed was possible of course but at this level no never were going to need new definitions new parameters\nwhy not yes of course since im the one who has made the so called warp barrier meaningless and captain this must be a special thrill for you\nas an explorer in three centuries of space flight weve charted just eleven percent of our galaxy and then we accomplish this\nof course i can ill just do what i did before coming riker\ndo you realise how many great advancements of mankind have been tied to speed this is a moment in history right here right now and your names will be forever linked with mine\ncome on\nyes why not\nas you wish\ntell the captain i am ready first officer\nthis isnt working\nit was me\ni honestly thought it was mei thought somehow somehow i was operating on his level\nthats not an explanation\nthats just so much nonsense your e asking us to believe in magic\ntheory\nwait captain not so fast we have an opportunity here for scientific discovery\nyou need me\nwarp one point five sir\ncaptain were passing warp ten\nreading all stop sir\ncalculating it sir data what do you read there\nwell sir according to these calculations weve not only left our own galaxy but passed through two other sending upon the far side of triangulum the galaxy known as m thirty three\nand i calculate that at maximum warp sir it would take over three hundred years to get home captains log stardate 412632 this will be a rather unusual log entry assuming starfleet ever receives it as i have already informed my crew a phenomenal surge of power during a warp speed experiment has sent our starship hurtling out of our own galaxy past another taking us over two million seven hundred thousand light years in a few minutes\nmessage on this has been transmitted to starfleet sir\ncaptain what are our options really i mean if this guy cant get us back who will\nive laid in the reciprocal course back captain\nwarp one point five sir\nanswering all stop captain\nall stopped sir\ntasha whats wrong you look scared to death\nare you all right well youre safe now\nwarp one point five retroactive two six one mark three one sir\nand our position reads exactly what it was before this sleighride began sir\nor whatever you want to call it data i dont have a proper name for it\non that same heading sir\nyou look tense jean luc come and have a cup of tea\nill make it good and strong the way you like it we will have a nice long talk\ndead but im always with you you know that\nyou mean out here at what you say us the end of the universe or do you see this as the beginning of it\ni dont understand your concern number one theyre not authorised to make any alterations in our engines and according to starfleet s report they will simply test different ways of entering warp speed and different intermix formulas whats the harm in that\ngibberish\nthen how do you explain starfleet s report that the same tests on the ajax and on the fearless over there resulted in a measurable increase in propulsion\nstandby for commander riker chief hes on his way\nsince your e concerned about these tests\nvery good\nengineering this is the bridge its your call\naffirmative number one are you ready\nlaforge set in warp one point five\nengage\nwhat is our velocity\nreverse engines\nbecause no one has gone this fast reverse engines\nall stop\nposition\nposition mister laforge\nthats not possible data what distance have we travelled\ni cant accept that\nmister data\njust explain what brought us here\nwhat is he saying number one\nconsidering where we are we must assume it isnt\nthrill\nyes but isnt the real point can you do it again can you get us home\ncommander riker will join you in a moment\ncomment is invited counsellor\nspoken like a true starfleet graduate it is tempting eh number one\ni know that if kosinski can get us home starfleet can use his technique to bring back a pure science vessel to do even more number one tell kosinski prepare to get us out of here\nstanding by number one\nas before picard\nall stop\nyes but where is this place\ndata you have the helm ill be in engineering\nwhats wrong\nensign what are you doing\nmaman\nthis cant be youve been\nyes ive felt that but why now suddenly\nwe believe it the outer rim mamando you understand these things can you tell me where my ship is what is this place\njust a moment number one\nno no lets help all of us general quarters red alert\ni had to get everyones attention it was the quickest way this is the captain this is not a drill it seems that in this place the world of the physical universe and the world of ideas is somehow intermixed what we think\nalso becomes a reality we must therefore i repeat must begin controlling our thoughts\nwe will give you more on this as our understanding increases the enterprise will stay at full alert until the crisis is over\nwhat did you do\nwhat are you talking about\nhow could you how could any of us\nif you knew something why didnt you say so\nhes unconscious why\nwhat does that mean\nhe must n thes the only one who can get us back\ncause\nwhat is the boy doing here\nhe knows we all know will he live\nwake him\nwe dont have that luxury wake him\ndoctor wes we all have other friends aboard this ship too if we stay here much longer we may lose the ability to distinguish between thought and reality now regardless of the risk wake him now\ndo you recognise me im the captain and i need answers\nwho are you or what\ntraveller what is your destination\nyes what place are you trying to reach\nthen what is the purpose of your journey\nthats not an answer\nuntil now\nour reality and in order to satisfy this curiosity you have brought my ship and my crew into great risk\nsome mistakes what mistakes could possibly explain these incredible explosions of velocity\ni believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyond galaxy m thirty three but there is no velocity of any magnitude that can possibly bring us wherever this is is it true what our navigation sensors are telling us are we millions of light years away from where we were\nwell what got us here\nthought\nnono it actually makes sense to me only the power of thought could explain what has been happening especially out here\nchaos what we think is what happens\nwhats happening\nrevive him\nunless he was distracted by something\ndo you have any facts that fit this can you get us back\nand we report our observations how to whom can you get us back\nnumber one take him down to main engineering ill be on the bridge\nstrange how he seems to care for you\nthe boy\ni must get my ship back do we have time for this\nencourage him in what\nsomewhat\nwere going to get back home take him to engineering\nill be on the bridge\nput it out\nthink put the flame out in your thoughts\nnow get to your station and concentrate on your assignment\ndo you have any further advice counsellor\nall decks all stations\nthis is the captain speaking all decks i must have your full attention in a few moments as we attempt to warp back home it is vital absolutely vital that you centre your thoughts on your duty or on the welfare of the one called the traveller\nthink of giving him some of your strength now this is an order you must try to do this\nand now attempt to concentrate completely on your duty of the moment or on the traveller on his wellbeing\nthink of him as someone you care deeply about\nall decks all stations battlestations\nhelm set in warp one point five retroactive course\nbridge to engineering standby\non my order mister data mister laforge engage\nits not happening its not enough\ncease red alert\ngone\nattention all decks this is to inform you that with your support the traveller has returned us to our galaxy however he has now left us wherever he has gone we wish him well have the boy sent to the bridge number one\nour next assignment is on this heading\nmister data mister laforge increase to warp five same heading\nah wesley come on the bridge move\ncommander riker has told me how supportive you were in engineering well done at ease sit here in command\noh thats true well i cant waive them again only commissioned officers\nplease dont interrupt me wesley\nany commissioned rank even ensign\nwell then ill have to make him an acting ensign captains log stardate 412634 for outstanding performance in the best of starfleet tradition wesley crusher is made acting ensign with the duties and privileges of that rank and whether that rank becomes permanent mister crusher depends on you at the earliest opportunity your entrance application for starfleet academy will be tendered until then you will learn this ship every operation every function commander riker a duty schedule for mister crusher heavy on study\nmeanwhile you can sit here and learn something\nwhy is someone ill or would you rather tell her about this wes\nits the specs that kosinski sent us in my opinion sir theyre gibberish\nmister data would you explain\nour engines are new sir top condition the tests on those older ships may have simply been to straighten out some engine inefficiency\nyes sir captain if i may ill ask counsellor troi to look these visitors over\nwelcome aboard mister kosinski im the first officer commander william riker and this is\nhe is engaged in other duties sir\nthey are sir which is why they have made the first officer directly responsible for an engines condition and performance guided of course by one of our chief engineers lieutenant commander argyle in this case\nand you sir are listed as\nyour e from tau alpha c thats very distant\nill have our chief engineer show you to his engine room\none thing that kosinski isnt hiding his bad disposition\nand the other one his assistant\nstay concerned please the safety of the enterprise may be entrusted to these two\nyou have all the time you need\nbut it has nt been approved by the chief engineer or by me\nnow you do\nif you like it wont change anything\nill leave that to you\ncould anything he s proposing damage our system\nthen we should let him try it\nengineering to bridge did you copy that\nwe are\nwere still trying to determine what happened sir\nto tell the truth sir it sounds to me like nonsense to me but considering\nayes iritis but as they say sir your e the captain\naye sir\nnot now wes\nim sure it was fascinating wesley i am looking forward to hearing about it but not right now\naye sir\nwere ready for you to engage captain\ncaptain you were reported headed for\ncan i help you sir\nit wasnt him it never was it was his assistant\nkosinski wasnt the one controlling the warp experiments\nthe equation she punched in were nonsense just as we thought\nwesley did\nhe tried twice i didnt listen\nwhen we saw it this time he seemed to be struggling fighting it\nyou may want him here before were done sir he seems to have developed some sort of special attachment to the boy\nand allowing kosinski to take credit for what you did\nyou are from a different time arent you\nand you have this ability to travel\nand others of your kind have the same ability\nthen why in all of our history is there no record of you or someone like you ever having visited us\nwhy not\nif i may suggest sir that first leap out of our galaxy was as he said a mistake\nand it weakened him in some way leading to the incredible leap out here\nyes sir\nyes sir\nengineering to bridge were ready\nthe travellers gone sir\nhes phased completely out of existence at least out of our existence\nwesley crusher report to the bridge on the double\nyes sir\ncaptain its not allowed your orders\nthat would give him authorised access to the bridge\naye sir\nsir shall is end for doctor crusher\nwhat is it\nyour e telling me that sa kittycat\nyou darling what are you doing here\nnow run this isnt a safe place at all\ni was i was this is crazy i was at the colony where i grew up being chased by a rape gang\nplus some genuine fear captain you cant notice whats happening outside without feeling some of that\nas mister kosinski s assistant my actual name is unpronounceable by humans\nsomething troubles you with the way this is configured how about it now\nnow will it do what kosinski says it will\nno theres no things he can do i need to rest ive been a way too long\nplease believe me i mean no harm to this vessel or those in it\nnot hats too cruel he has sensed some small part of it\nboy dont ever say that again and especially not at your age in a world thats not ready for such such dangerous nonsense\nnoi will help\nill do my best to provide\ni am a traveller\ndestination\nah place no there is no specific place i wish to go\ncuriosity\ni have certain abilities they give me an understanding of propulsion ive been trading this for passage on starfleet vessels\nit seemed the sensible way\ncaptain i seek only transportation in order to see and experience your reality i am no a threat to you your ship or your crew\ni have made some mistakes\ni dont know if i can put this in terms youll understand\nwell yes\nthought\nyou do understand dont you that thought is the basis of all reality the energy of thought to put it in your terms is very powerful\ni have the ability to act like a lens which focuses thought\nwell yes this could seem like magic to you\nthought is the essence of where you are now you do understand the danger dont you\nit pains mei was so careless captain my intent was only to observe not to cause this you should not be here until your far far distant future certainly not until you have learned control\nwell no not exactly from another time although as you understand the concept yes perhaps that term fits as well as any\nyes\nyes\nwhat wonderful arrogance there is no record because we have not visited you before\nwell up until now if you ll forgive this youve been uninteresting its only now that your life form merits serious attention im sorry\ni will try\nthe captains right we must hurry but first i request a moment with the captain alone\nhe will forget me in time which is as it should be its wesley i wanted to speak to you about\nits best you do not repeat this to the others especially not to the mother whatever may happen it is imperative that it proceed naturally\noh yes he and a few like him are why i travel you have it in your power to encourage him without interfering\nhow shall i explain are you familiar with the intricacies of what is called here music\nsuch musical genius is a win one of your ships libraries one called mozart who as a small child wrote astonishing symphonies a genius who made music not only to be heard but seen and felt beyond the understanding the ability of others wesley is such a person not with music but with the equally lovely intricacies of time energy propulsion and the instruments of this vessel which allow all that to be played your e right i must hurry now but your e right in something else he is just a boy for now he should be encouraged but told none of this\ni will need kosinski back on the main computer\nyes\nagreed also hes arrogant overbearing self important and very sure of himself and his ability\nhes the puzzle with most life forms i can usually feel something i may not be able to understand or interpret it but i feel something if only a presence with him nothing empty space its as though he isnt even here something about this concerns me i dont know what i cant point out a reason yet\nhes convinced hes right i have no doubt of that\nwhen you begin the attempt there will be stress and its only natural the crews concentration will shift\ni feel such an abundance of wellbeing on the ship it feels like quite wonderful\nour engines are new sir top condition the tests on those older ships may have simply been to straighten out some engine inefficiency\nstandby for commander riker chief hes on his way\nyes but shouldnt these be connected here and here\nit has a chance it might work better this way yes\ncan i do something to help i can call my mother shes a doctor\nwhat happened to you is it part of what happened to the ship\nis mister kosinski like he sounds a joke\nthat space and time and thought arent the separate things they appear to be i just thought the formula you were using said something like that\nexcuse me commander riker i dont think he did this i think\nbut sir when this all happened i was watching his assistant\nhes too tired why dont you do it by yourself\nhe phased sir\nparts of him disappeared and then came back nobody else was paying attention to him the first time\nis he going to be all right\nmom hes my friend\nmy name is wesley commander riker\nhe isnt captain i know he isnt\nno hes very weak\nits quite all rights iri understand\nim sorry sir\nif you dont mind sir id like to sit here awhile ill tell her later back to the episode listing star trek and related marks

    "episode 40": "we have analysed your defensive capabilities as being unable to withstand us if you defend yourselves you will be punished\nthe captain is not on the ship\ncaptain picard is in ten forward\nsensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector\nsearch pattern has been input sir\nwe have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a vessel without warp drive could traverse in the time allotted\naccording to these coordinates we have travelled seven thousand light years\nand are located near the system j two five\nat maximum warp in two years seven months three days eighteen hours we would reach starbase one eight five\nthere is a system of roads on this planet which indicates a highly industrialised civilisation but where there should be cities there are only great rips in the surface\nit is identical to what happened to the outposts along the neutral zone\nthe ship is strangely generalised in design there is no specific bridge no command centre there is

eighteen seconds\nshields are down sir\ntractor beam is released sir force field is maintaining our hull integrity\nperhaps because this ship was scanned for individual life signs apparently when they are in these slots they become part of the whole and no longer read as separate life forms\ncaptain i would theorise that the borg are somehow interconnected through these slots and are working

and i were on leave at far space starbase earhart it was little more than a galactic outpost in those days\nthats right well my mates and i were at the bones tell recreation facility which was something of a dead rough crossroads at the time filled with an assorted bunch of galactic riffraff when a trio of nausicaa ns came in they were clearly spoiling for a confrontation with a group of fresh faced starfleet officers such as ourselves well everyone in the group had the good sense to give these nausicaa ns a wide berth to standoff everyone that is except mei stood toe to toe with the worst of the three and i told him what i thought of him his pals his planet and i possibly made some passing reference to his questionable parentage and the next thing i knew all three of them were on me and i was fighting for my life i was actually doing quite well for awhile too\ni had this one nausicaa n down in this somewhat devious joint lock when unbeknownst to me one of his chums drew his weapon and impaled me through the back curious sensation actually not much pain shock certainly at the sight of serrated metal sticking through my chest a certain giddy warmth in fact i do actually remember that i laughed out loud well it pierced my heart of course well if wed not been so near to a medical facility i would surely have died\nnothing i was no hero wesley i was an undisciplined loudmouthed opinionated young man who was way out of his league i learned a very hard very painful lesson that day but i learned it well i hope you never have to learn it the same way care for another

to be am down with the other delegates\nhill the name is slade bender\nits about alva\nokay you want to play stupid thats jake with me a week ago a man came in here he wanted you to find his

think ill ever learn to see men the way you do\nperhaps i should tell you something about my mothers condition at this time\nits something that occurs to beta zoid females as they enter midlife we call it the phase\nsimilar its only at midlife that a beta zed female becomes well fully sexual if you know what i mean\ni wonder if i shouldnt warn him\ndoctor\nyes an animal is always at its best when hunted\ni hope im not interrupting\nwhy would you come aboard at a time like this\ndont be absurd mother you knew what would happen\nwhat stage is it in\nwhat stage is it in\nnow i know why you wore that dress\nwhat are we going to do\nmother dont even think it\nactually her telepathic prowess is quite advanced except for now\nmy mother is beginning a physiological phase its one that all beta zoid women must deal with as they enter midlife\nor more\ni didnt want to frighten you she has opted for the only dignified option open to her\nshe has decided to focus all of her sexual energy on one male who will of course eventually become her husband it seems captain that you are the early favourite\nyou can not apply human style logic to this captain a beta zoid woman in the phase would be shocked and deeply resentful should you spurn any such advances she would take it personally\nim afraid so mother\nalternate plan\nmother what are you doing here you cant just stroll onto the bridge whenever you feel like it\nyour e scheming something mother dont try to fool mei can tell\nmother not him\nno\nwhy did you stop me someone needs to set her straight\ncoward\nbut you always say you like surprises mother\noh let me talk to them im sure im more articulate than that\nare they alright captain\nwill we try to revive them\nwhats in that container\nthey eat this\nthey are rather strange looking commander\non screen captain\nand she actually complimented captain picard on his legs\nif you say so lieutenant\nwell maybe at first a little but now that ive seen more klingons ive come to think your e handsome for a klingon that didnt quite come out the way i meant sir\nnot until we reach pacific am a am\nwhat was that all about\nmarried\naye sir\nwhat a handsome race\ncaptain

believe the wiser course of action here is to bend\nthat is correct fold to bend to make compactor to capitulate\ni do not believe lieutenant worf understands all the nuances of this betting procedure\nthe cards have been favouring the lieutenant but that is the result of random chance therefore a temporary condition\ngeordi\nthe game is seven card stud after the queen one eyed jacks and low card in the hole are wild\nemergency signal reads as follows enterprise to divert to coordinates four two three by one one two by five one immediately further orders forthcoming\nthe message does not elaborate\nour destination is a point near the borad is system\nthe first federation outpost was established thirty four years ago on borad is three\nyet we are not headed for a specific colony the coordinates given are outside the borad is system\nnone sir\nwe are receiving sir\napparently there were no starships available on starbase one five three the envoy is aboard a class eight probe\nby sending the probe to meet us rather than diverting the enterprise they are saving us six point one hours\nas far as i can determine sir very little there are four colonies in the borad is system as well as nine other outposts scattered throughout the sector\nthere are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector\nbased on the last assumed position of the klingon vessel its apparent trajectory and our estimates of their cruising speed we should be in scanner range in fifteen hours eight minutes\nandroid of course is correct but i fail to see how chaperon is applicable in this situation\nat the moment i would find it difficult to choose\ncaptain we are detecting a ship\nbearing three one six mark four two data\nsensors show life forms aboard but i am unable to ascertain whether they are awake or dormant however the vessels propulsion systems are inactive so i would hypothesize that the crew is asleep\nhowever i could be in error\nthe tong has changed course to three two mark eight one increasing to warp three\nthe tong is now on a heading off our two mark one one three they are accelerating to warp five\nthey are slowing to impulse sir\ni know exactly what you mean my father was human and my mother is a beta zoid\ngreetings captain picard\ncaptain you will soon be joined by a federation special emissary from starbase one five three we are now transmitting the specifics\nthe rendezvous will be a bit tricky so it is imperative you reach the intercept point on schedule\nthe envoy will fill you in you are to cooperate fully\nnegative\ni

klingon\nklingons are not supposed to mind hardship nonetheless i am delighted to be out of that damned coffin\nwhoever said that getting there was half the fun never rode in a class eight probe\nno doubt because i am only half klingon\nyes my father was klingon my mother was human\nworf so this is where you ve been hiding i told you wed meet again arent you going to greet me\nhavent changed a bit well i missed you too two days ago starbase three three six received an automated transmission from a klingon ship the tong that ship was sent out over seventy five years ago\nthe message was directed to the klingon high command it said only that the ship was returning home and was about to reach its awakening point\nexactly\nwell have a ship full of klingons who think the war is still going on\na klingon ship the prang is on its way but its two days behind us that may be too late\nnice ripe targets for a klingon warship\nno not a chance if you ask me talking will be a waste of time klingons of that era were raised to despise humans well try diplomacy but i promise you it wont work and then you ll have to destroy them\nno captain these klingons are killers youll have no choice\ncaptain\nactually the is compatible with a fair amount of help rather like my parents\nreally it was the other way around for me my mother was human you must ve grown up like i did trapped between cultures\nperhaps you got the best of each\nmyself i think i got the worst of each\noh yes having my mothers sense of humour is bad enough its gotten me into plenty of trouble\nthat i keep under tight control its like a terrible temper its not something i want people to see\nnot like mine sometimes i feel theresa monster inside of me fighting to get out\nof course it does my klingon side can be terrifying even to me\nthat doesnt mean i have to like it\nsorry had to make myself beautiful\nworf were alone now you dont have to act like a klingon glacier i dont bite well thats wrong i do bite\nyou werent this aloof six years ago or dont you remember\nwell theres something wrong with the rest of you youre not even looking at me\nand it gives you no pleasure to see me again it isnt as if we tried it and it didnt work you know you never gave it a chance\ni mean asi see it we have some unfinished business you and i\nprobably some secret military objective\nwhy else would there be no record of the mission\nwhat does it matter our concern is the present the possible threat\nwe have all the information we need\nthere is nothing to understand these are klingons theyll attack in their minds were the enemy and theres no way were going to talk them out of that\nand i do not appreciate wasting my time\nthere are nt any the assignments hopeless\noh are there tell me whatever happened to that wonderful klingon fatalism of yours\nstarfleet hasnt improved you one bit your eas stubborn as ever\nall right i will upon due consideration of the problem and careful examination of all possible options my original recommendation stands meeting adjourned\ncome\nyour finely honed beta zoid sense tells you that\ni warned you about my klingon half\ni thank you counsellor but i dont want any counseling\noh\nand itll keep me from wrecking the ship\nshow me the exercise menu hold calisthenics programme of lieutenant worf\nits not much of a programme\nsome calisthenics programs are better than others\nyou dont like people with a sense of humour\nworf your e the perfect klingon the ultimate minimalist talk to me\nwhereas others take a simpler approach say nothing\nor is loath to speak them why didnt we do this six years ago\ni was\nperhaps we lacked courage as well\nwait you cant mean\nyes i know i was there but\nim not going to become your wife\ndont give me that klingon nonsense\ntheyre not sacred theyre absurd marrying you is out of the question for a million reasons\nworf it was what it was glorious and wonderful and all that but it doesnt mean anything\ni am human\nso that means we should bond for life\nyours not mine\ni will not take the oath\nbelieve what you will\nive been working on our assignment trying a few computer simulations\nunwilling to be alone with me\nan android chaperon\nnever mind i guess i cant blame you tell me one thing you would have gone through with the oath wouldnt you regardless of the consequences to our careers to our lives\nwhat do you want is honour all you care about dont you feel anything else no comment huh poor android whose behaviour do you find more perplexing human or klingon\nso would i okay when we locate the tong there are two possibilities first\nwe find the ship before it reaches the awakening point in that case we simply keep the crew asleep\nthen we await the arrival of the klingon ship prang\nbut theres the second possibility that the crew of the tong has already revived\nklingons of that ear doing research for its own sake\nthe point is that this is beside the point these are klingons at war with us whatever their mission was once they see a federation target theyll attack\nthat would gain you nothing disable the ship and kte moc will destroy it himself\nif we dont reach the tong before it screw wakes up you have no alternatives\nbetter lock in phasers this may be the only chance you get\nwell captain youve had your chance\ncaptain let them die like klingons in battle they deserve that much\nand you wore it well\nin the meantime ill begin the assimilation of these klingons to our era\nno nothing else damn you worf you d let me go without saying another word wouldnt you\nnothing everything were about to go our separate ways again\ni hid the truth from you last night did have meaning i was tempted to take the oath with you but it scared me ive never had such strong feelings toward anyone\nthen it was more than just a point of honour maybe some day when our paths cross again i wont be as easy to get rid of\nwhat what is this\nwhat treachery is this by whose authority\ni have standing orders to fire on all federation ships\ni have no proof of that\nhow do i know this is not a federation trick how can i be sure\nand if i refuse\nyou dare not destroy

has colonised several planets in that sector\ndata what ship is carrying the envoy\na class eight probe is just over two metres long\nand it is designed to travel at warp nine\nbut still to seal

blame you its not the most luxurious accommodation starfleet has to offer\ncaptain allow me to present special federation emissary kehl e yr\nwhen the federation and the klingon empire were still at war\nand when this crew is revived\nwhy us wouldnt a klingon ship be a better choice\nwhen the tong crew awakens it will be within striking range of several federation outposts\nwe just ran a full

unsound advice\nwhy doctor it is done and perhaps just as well this has indicated that i am damaged in some fashion i must find the malfunction\ncome in please\ncaptain with all due respect perhaps it would be better if you choose another to serve as your first officer\ni have not been able to isolate the problem siri might make a mistake\nyes sir\ni believe i understand sir\ni have several examples of commander rikers battle technique at the academy he calculated a sensory blind spot on athol ian vessel and hid within it during a battle simulation and as a lieutenant aboard the potemkin his solution to a crisis was to shut down all power and hangover a planets magnetic poles thus confusing his opponents sensors\nonly twenty one percent of the time does he rely upon traditional tactics so the captain must be prepared for unusual cunning counsellor commander riker will assume we have made this analysis and knowing that we know his methods he will alter them but knowing that we know that he knows that we know he might choose to return to his usual pattern\na fighter\nthe weaker his position the more aggressive will be his posture\nthen despite whatever options he is given

have you suspended the game\nno sir it is a stalemate\ni simply altered my premise for playing the game\nworking under the assumption that kol rami was attempting to win it is reasonable to assume that he expected me to play for the same goal\nnoi was playing only for a standoff a draw while kol rami was dedicated to winning i was able to pass up obvious avenues of advancement and settle for a balance theoretically i should be able to challenge him indefinitely\nit is a matter of perspective doctor in the strictest sensei did not win\ni busted him up\ncaptain i bring greetings from those at starfleet command\ni require little rest captain i prefer that we commence with our mission\nthe bras lot a system in orbit around the second planet is the eighty year old star cruiser hathaway he is still your first choice\nyou will have forty eight hours to ready your vessel before the enterprise attacks\ncorrect engineering will disconnect the enterprises weapons and link the system with the modified laser pulse beam all hits will be recorded electronically if the computer registers damage it will act accordingly shutting down the affected areas for the appropriate repair time additional questions captain picard it is my understanding that you initially resisted starfleet s request for this simulation\nmay i know why\nthen why ami here\nyour objection is noted let us hope your distaste for the exercise will not affect your strategic abilities\ni had envisioned you defining the crew\nvery well captain pulaski\nalthough i am intrigued by the audacity of your request i cant fathom why you wish the encounter\nvery well an opponent of limited dimensions can often be quite diverting\nthe simulation will commence in forty eight hours\ni believe the rules are understood by all\nthe only offensive systems youll need will be simulated by computer\nchallenge we do not whine about the inequities of life and how you perform in a mismatch is precisely what is of interest to starfleet after all when one is in the superior position one is expected to win\nlieutenant commander data i am intrigued by your challenge doctor pulaski informed me of your desire to play a game of strategem a\nplay against a machine why should i wish to\nbut i wouldnt lose now youre no doubt going to tell me that i have to prove it to you\nthen you will play for the honour of your ship\nhe should be escorted and have no contact with anything save his research\ni saw no sense in riker choosing him anyway just a noncommissioned child\nthoroughly enjoyable mister data i am at your disposal for a rematch\nyour crew is excellently trained captain a tribute to your leadership although i doubt their extensive preparation will be needed\ni do not expect captain riker will present much of a challenge\ncaptain i\nhaving studied william rikers file prior to this assignment i have found him wanting\nhis work record is exemplary but as you well know a starship captain is not manufactured he

the hathaway is expendable\nimpossible that ship was rendered warp inactive\ni must admit your commander riker acquitted himself quite admirably and so captain have you my report to starfleet will be most favourable\nbah\nbecause this is not a rematch you have made a mockery of me\nanother millimetre thats it a little more there thats excellent\nyes commander\nyes sir and the best of luck to you ive researched the old avi dyne engines theyre archaic by our standards very touchy\nive already taken the liberty of putting together a few necessities\nso you re going to beat him\nwell then its

the infection\nand negative emotions\nproduce endorphins that inhibit the organisms growth\nassuming were not too late already\nim not sure his vital signs are getting weaker i dont want to risk another dose of tricor drazin e unless i have toi must refocus the pattern again we need to isolate memories that generate stronger negative emotions i know i can count on every klingon warrior in this crew to serve and die in that battle so i ask you again commander riker where are your loyalties\nweve reduced the growth rate even further but not enough and his vital signs are deteriorating\nthey must be producing a type of endorphin thats poisonous to the organisms\ni can refocus the impulse pattern even tighter but i dont know if he can withstand it hes extremely weak\nno if we dont neutralise the infection within half an hour hell be dead medical log supplemental commander rikers condition is still critical ive discovered a way to reverse the infections growth rate but i may be too late\nrespiration shallow heartbeat extremely irregular but we cant delay any longer\nthe growth rates down to seven percent the organisms are still impairing his neural functions respirations erratic pulse grossly irregular blood pressure almost nil tricor drazin e\nthats not good enough\nsickbay to bridge\nweve eradicated the infection\nhow do you feel\nyoull be pleased to know that weve terminated the infection\nlie still i have a few dozen tests to run first\nthere may be some residual memory loss i just want to be sure you still know who you are\nquite ready commander\nactually i brought it for doctor crusher but perhaps you would like you to see it first\na form of life it was discovered accidentally by a survey team on an uncharted planet\noh youll be hearing about it shortly but first there remains much scientific study to be done after all it is a superior form of life\ntotally come have a look\nit wont like your science officer it does like you

was walking along minding my own business doing a simple geological sweep something stuck me in the leg\nno just a little numb thats all\nthis is the strangest feeling my whole leg just went dead

give her a challenge\nthats why the transporters biofilters werent able to extract it\nmy legs still asleep\nwhy would nti be comfortable theyre waiting on me hand and foot i hope that they dont find out that im faking it\nyes doctor showed it to me too rather harmless looking thing i thought\nwell these things happen\nim surprised they dont happen more often after all we are exploring the unknown\ncaptain one of the things ive learned anything on these voyages on this ship and from you is that most life forms act out of an instinct for survival not out of malice\nif you drop a hammer on your foot its hardly useful to get mad at the hammer\nthis bug is persistent ill admit that but im not worried we rikers are ornery too as a matter of fact my great grandfather once got bit by a rattlesnake after three days of intense pain the snake died\ni try\nyou of all people should know\nas the first officer on this ship i have to set an example\nnow more than ever deanna facing death is the ultimate test of character i dont want to die but if i have to id like to do it with a little pride\nyou bet dying is bad enough but to lose my sense of humour forget it\ni havent given up yet\ntasha data geordi worf anybody\nhello\nthere are some puzzles down on the planet that the captain wants answered he suggested that i take you with me on the away team ill be leading\nyes when the captain suggested you i looked up your record\nthen your rank of lieutenant commander is honorary\nbut your files they say your e a\nto be honest yes a little\nnow that does trouble me do you consider yourself superior to us\nnice to meet you pinocchio a joke\nyour e going to be an interesting companion mister data\nguinan i need your help could you step over here a minute\nnow the first words out of your mouth are the most important you may want to start with something like this here you are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy but that might not work\nyou dont know how long ive wanted to tell you that\nyes\nof us of what we might become\nor that you might think that was a line\nthen you think im not sincere\nthen your e inviting me in\nthats more than i expected\nto hope is to recognise the possibility i had only dreams\nnot these dreams i dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars and the universe worships the night\nthen ill learn how to fly you are the heart in my day and the soul in my night\ni didnt want to leave without saying goodbye\nhow about until next time\nthe feeling is mutual counsellor\nperhaps your own feelings are getting in the way\nnot to me our feelings are what make us all human\nyes i am\ngentlemen if this is what you call enhancement you ve got a gift for understatement whats a knock out like you doing in a computer generated joint like this\nwaiting for me you cant be serious\ni know you are a computer generated image but your smell your touch the way you feel even the things you say and think seem so real\nhow far can this relationship go i mean how real are you\nyes i find you very attractive\nits not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader of another world\nno its not but will you still respect me in the

assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders and i will do exactly that\ni just did\nis there something you wanted to say to me lieutenant\nthen i take it you challenge my authority over you\nand your position on this captain\nready for your tour admiral\nwhats in the case\nwhat is it\nwhy havent we heard anything about that\nsuperior\ni think ill summon my science officer\nwho are you\nhelp data some things got me\nno no dont\nyes set auto destruct sequence now\nwell handle the formalities later right now we have to get off this ship are there any others survivors\ncheck him out\nthen pick the body and lets get out of here\ntransporter room have you got a lock on us\ndata some things got me\nyour e still here\nbeat you wouldnt believe the dreams i was having\ngreat work doctor no wifi can get out of here id like to get back\nwhy i feel fine\nof course i know who i am im captain jean luc picard of the uss enterprise\neveryone weve brought the visitors\nyou will take us to our planet and leave us there with our medicine or this person dies dont you see i have no choice we were sent to bring the felici um back the suffering on my planet is too great people are dying it doesnt matter whether were entitled to it or not we must have it\nyou will take us there now or give us a shuttle but we must have the medicine if you refuse this person will die\ni will do iti will kill him\nwere not going without our shuttle crew\nenough we have people who need attention we wont hurt you but we must help them\naye sir\ntoo much interference you have to get farther away from the engineering section\nyour e a very entertaining patient\nyes your e making quite an effort to be cheerful\nyou feel what anyone in your position would feel\neven now\nand a lot of

a pleasure working with you commander\nim supposed to know how everyone feels but i can tread you right now\nmy job is to help others sort out their emotions my own feelings are beside the point\nare you feeling sad\nso ami\nhes relaxed experiencing feelings of warmth and friendship\nto intensify his memories\nno its just that commander rikers emotions are rather passionate\nvery much so\nthen all weve done is made things worse\nor the emotions that they produce\nthen if some types of endorphins attract them\nyou must save him\nsadness\nthen your theory s correct the organisms are sensitive to different types of endorphins\nsuch as sadness\nthen weve found a way to repel the infection\nhow much time do we have\nbut weve isolated the specific areas to stimulate the feelings were primal survival emotions\ncant you intensify that emotion\ndo we have a choice\nhes getting weaker isn the\ncan we tighten the pattern further\nthe growth rates almost down to zero\ni could ask you the same question\noh yes we would\nwhat should i say how do i act what do i do\ncommander\ni dont think this is my style\nsir the engineering section is critical destruction of the bat ris is imminent",

fell asleep and when i woke up i saw the container had been left open its just a science project\ntheyre really harmless i mean they re equipped with only the most basic skills its almost impossible

more and how can you know you havent even been here\ni think ive made a horrible mistake\nits true i am responsible for this i allowed two of the na nites to interact for a school project i wanted to increase their capabilities and they escaped\nwell this is a sample of linear memory crystal from our computer core\nwere trying low gamma bursts we think it might slow down their productivity\nwere

here when the shelia k colony ship arrives they will eradicate you\nthey have little regard for human life thus the most sensible course is to prepare a contingency plan for the evacuation of your people\nperhaps i have not made myself clear\nhave you seen many\nno positronic\nim afraid i have no time to answer a million questions i have a mission to accomplish i need to know more about your people and gosh even seems unwilling to talk to me further\nthe possibility does exist yet gosh even seems unwilling to prepare for it why\ni am not ordering him to do anything i am merely trying to persuade him that his people should prepare to evacuate do you believe my suggested course of action should be followed\nin spite of the fact that i a man android\nnoi would say not\nand you conclude because of this that i am impartial hence you accept my recommendations yet gosh even does not\ndata here\nunderstood sir\naye sir we must speak to gosh even immediately\nit is water a substance composed of two atoms of hydrogen\nthe shelia k will not accept humans on their planet and they will not hesitate to use force to remove you\nare his sentiments typical of the colonists\nif i can convince enough people of the necessity of leaving\ncommander\nin human parlance i do not believe i can get the job done my training has prepared me for starship command duties as a cultural contact i am proving to be\nless than exemplary\ntheir leader refuses my counsel\nhe denies the logic of my arguments and speaks of structures they have built\ni have sir\nin the last three hours and eight minutes i have spoken to fifty six colonists ten of those refused to believe a threat exists twenty two favour staying and fighting the shelia k sixteen prefer negotiation or\nsome form of passive resistance only eight were willing to consider evacuation and of those eight\nsir if i do not succeed how violent is the shelia k reaction likely to be\nah\nis there any indication that gosh even has changed his position\nso far my attempts at persuasion have been ineffective\nwhy did you do that\namong humans a kiss usually serves to seal a friendship or indicate support attraction affection in this context i must assume that your intention was to express support\nthat is something of an understatement\nthus far that quality has not helped me to accomplish my mission\nelicit a desired behaviour by advocating its opposite that implies deception does it not\nperhaps this is a situation where excessive honesty can be detrimental\ni wish to speak\ndo you consider your position so weak that it can not withstand debate\nyou know of the shelia k threat starfleet wishes to evacuate you for your own protection yet gosh even has decided otherwise that is his right and i will not waste time trying to reverse that decision i admire your conviction in the face of certain defeat though doomed your effort will be valiant and when you die you will die for land and honour your children will understand that they are dying for a worthy cause long after the battle is over their courage will be remembered and extolled\nyes that is true there will be no one left alive to remember\ni was simply attempting to describe your inevitable destruction in a manner that would have an emotional effect\nthen here you die\nand you\nif you so desire\nthe federation will offer as little or as much help as you dictate\napparently that is not correct\ni appear to be reversing that defeat\ni am equipped with diagnostic circuits and am able to correct many malfunctions\nperhaps that is a part of our difficulty words are all we have been using humans seem to take much stronger notice of actions i require a phaser\na type of weapon unfortunately it does not function in the presence of hyperon ic radiation i will have to be innovative\nhyperon ic radiation random is es phaser beams but i believe i can improvise a servo circuit which will compensate by continuously re collimating the output\nessentially correct get word to gosh even tell him i am coming to the pumping station tell him i am going to destroy the aqueduct\ni sincerely hope so\nstop that was the stun setting this is not\ni can reduce this pumping station to a pile of debris but i trust my point is clear i am one android with a single weapon there are hundreds of shelia k on the way and their weapons are far more powerful they may not offer you a target they can obliterate you from orbit you will die never having seen the faces of your killers the choice is yours\ni know that this is just a thing and things can be replaced lives can not\nlieutenant commander data to enterprise i am preparing to leave tau cyg na five and await rendezvous instructions\ni could not have succeeded without your support and insight i am grateful for your assistance\ni am incapable of forgetting i will remember every detail of my visit here with perfect clarity\ni do not understand\ni have no feelings of any kind\nyou appeared to need it\nthank you sir\nas i have recently reminded others siri have no feeling\nstrictly speaking sir it is not my playing it is a precise imitation of the techniques of jascha heifetz and tren kab ron ken\ni suppose i have learned to be creative sir when necessary\nso he is well now that your e here what do you want\nwhy\nand who is this shelia k\nwell this colony s been here over ninety years weve never seen a shelia kid say that makes tau cyg na five our planet\nthe guidance system on the artemis failed took them off course far off course our ancestors were lucky to find any place to land\nhyperon ic radiation took the lives of a third of the colonists before they learned they could adapt to it\nlook around we have brought water to the desert built a community\nthen change the treaty\nwere not evacuating\nyes you have let me be equally clear theres going to be no evacuation youve delivered your message so go back to your ship i have work to do\nfound a new toy have wear di\nonly you would get this excited over a walking calculator\nyou see this do you have any idea what it is or what it means\nits not water its blood and its sweat its the result of a ninety years of combined effort this isnt a town its a monument to every man woman and child who s lived and died on tau cyg na five\nami my grandfather is buried on that mountain he died in a rockslide surveying the route for this aqueduct this colony exists because of his sacrifice and the sacrifice of thousands of others no were not leaving\nwe will not be bullied of four land not by you and not by the shelia k\nyouve all heard of the android starfleet sent here and you ve been discussing why he s come ive called this meeting to replace misinformation with cold hard fact\nno leave now\na valiant try android but what a low opinion you must have of us\nare you ready to follow this machine give up without a fight he says were going to lose but i think thats just his cowardice talking\nthis colony exists because generations gave their lives for it many people died before we found a way to adapt to the radiation and many more died bringing water to the desert my grandfather\nhave you considered what this evacuation means everything we have we abandon everything that we have built turns into dust everything that we have accomplished means nothing well i say no you elected me your leader follow me now i dont think our chances are as hopeless as he says and im willing to stake our lives on it any objections good because here we stand\ndont forget that kent or im disappointed i thought wed settled this\nstill stirring up trouble\nits over dont you get it you had your say you lost\nno your e not your e just stubborn well let me tell you something\nso ami\nive killed no one i merely shut down a machine that sit everyone its time to go home youll see that im right\ni really was willing to stay here and die for this\ni think its some sort of shuttlecraft\nlook at the markings it must be from the federation\nwe saw your ship your e the first visitor weve had in\nyour e not human\nour great grandparents were citizens of the federation but you dont want to waste time talking to us\nim sure the federation will be very proud of us wait until you see all weve accomplished\ndont you know ohno i dont guess you would were descendants of the original settlers from the colony ship artemis\ngosh even look whats come\nand when they did the radiation started killing them\nthey d kill all of us\nlet him talk\nand he describes it pretty damned well\nmister data i just want you to know that gosh even doesnt speak for all of us i see no reason to die needlessly\nthere are many others that feel the same way but they re very uneasy about confronting gosh even\nwe do we like to do things on our own\nwhy do we need to\nyou killed him\nwhere sit from\nthe first visitor weve ever had\nyou want to speak to gosh even well take you to him\nhe san android\nbut our colony survived and prospered\nwhat if he s right and your e wrong shouldnt we consider that possibility\nim not sure gosh evens done well for us but id like to hear more of what you have to say\nand once the federation re settles us well be left alone\nyes the question is how do we convince gosh even\nbecause he s respected most people will do what he says\ni dont know gosh evens got a lot of supporters\nthere are other places other challenges\nyeah but that sim yes sir\nour first attempt\nabout like you d expect sir\nthats the short definition of captain\ncaptain we can do it we can modify the transporters\nitll take fifteen years and a research team of a hundred\nyes sir\noh\nexcessive honesty can be disastrous particularly in a commander\nknowing your limitations is one thing advertising them to a crew can damage your credibility as a leader\non screen\nwhat the devil\ncancel message\nhumans cant survive in that environment exposure to hyperon ic radiation is fatal\nno number one the shelia k havent broken a century of silence to send us after phantoms an investigation is in order set course for tau cyg na

transporters to function despite the hyperon ic radiation\nthee and me\ntry them again boost the signal strength\nconversation is necessary if we are to find a solution to our mutual problem\nboth parties are involved sir\nlet us negotiate in good faith\nthere is a thriving colony on that planet rather than uproot these people may i offer a compromise\nwhy\nthis is not a law it is a treaty it is designed to smooth relations between peoples not to act as a strait\njacket\npicard to commander data\nthe shelia k wont bargain\nim contacting starfleet to arrange transport get those people prepared to evacuation we may have to move quickly\ncome\nthree weeks starfleet is profuse in their apologies but it will still be three weeks until the arrival of a colony transport ship equipped with dedicated personnel shuttles\nthen the shelia k must agree to extend our deadline they plan to settle tau cyg na five two days from now\nwere going to intercept that ship\na risk we have to take\nnow are we progressing mister laforge\nsplendid splendid carry on\nbut we must have something in common we communicate\ntelepaths\ncup glass\npoint taken\non my way so it begins\nhailing

leave the system but we were unable to affect it otherwise it could return\ndo you know that for a fact kevin\nbut there had to be some reason in some way you were different from the other colonists

have been injured including a woman who s mind is slowly being destroyed by telepathic manipulation\nyour rights what about rishon is she in favour of being here left here come to the enterprise let me take you where you ll be safe\nwhy are you safe why is this house a sanctuary does it have to do with you with your refusal to fight tell me this if rishon were in danger would you kill to save her

interrupted a waltz\ni want to end the suffering of one of my crew members\nkevin does hes the cause at first i couldnt understand why your house survived the holocaust when the others hadnt then it occurred to me it had been destroyed that dwelling where you served me tea where you danced your waltzes is a reproduction real to the touch but capable of being created destroyed and created all on a whim\nmore than anything else you wanted the enterprise away from ran a because the house the plot of land your very existence were incongruities that you were not prepared to explain the warship another recreation tried to chase us away twice and failed but when i came to your house the second time i provided you with the only condition that would make the enterprise leave your deaths you did your best to satisfy that condition\nyoull be taken to the nearest starbase and held responsible for the attack on the enterprise and possibly the deaths of eleven thousand people\nbut you havent told us the whole story how it ended the part about rishon\nrishon i can touch you i can hear your voice i can smell your perfume in every respect you are a real person with your own mind and beliefs but you do not exist you died along with the others defending the colony here created you just as here created the house\nyou are the only living thing that really exists on rana and though you look human your e not\nlet him go\nso dangerous mister worf that he could have destroyed us in an instant had he wished track him alert the crew to keep clear of hmi want him to understand we mean him no harm\nif he is the creature of conscience i believe him to be he has someone to help first\nwhat happened on ran a four the truth this time all of it\nyour colony was attacked by a warship\nso you let the colonists fight a hopeless battle\nand then what you most feared happened rishon went to fight with the colonists and died with them\nbut you couldnt you were left alone\nwere not qualified to be your judges we have no law to fit your crime your e free to return to the planet and to make rishon live again\nshields up maximum strength\nopen a frequency to colony operations\nhelm put us in high

student with this threadbare suit and mismatched shoes i was travelling with my parents who did not like the way that he kept hanging around two hours after i met him i asked him to marry me and he knew i was serious i dont think that he has ever recovered from that day\nwell what do you think mister worf\nyou mean at our age well we thought it might make us fall in love all over again it worked\nyes it was fire slit the sky there was thunder this unbelievable thunder the ground never stopped shaking\nwe dont know why we survived and the others didnt ive tried to put some purpose to it

senior officers doctor crusher and i decided to approach the captain regarding his recent behaviour\nid like you to come to sickbay for some examinations captain\nid like to conduct them now sir\nim concerned that youve suddenly turned the ship away from its course\nno sir\nhere are the results from the exams you ordered sir you dont care to inspect them please are you jean luc\nthe jean luci

that\nferengi contacts have been detected on both se lay and antica sir\ninquiry private eye\na most interesting occupation\nimprecise lieutenant they omitted certain truths which in itself tells us something\nindubitably my good woman\nhas studied sir every case as holmes wouldve pointed out during the time in question something was a foot\nwhile both sets of delegates say they were in their quarters our crew locator sensed them passing here and here\non the contrary dear colleague on their return they drew medical supplies appropriate to the treatment of minor wounds and abrasions on these life forms\nexactly that they were too engaged in their own affairs to have disabled our ship and murdered the engineer given a choice they d rather kill each other than any of us its elementary my dear riker sir\nyes sir if you wish sir but i ask if you d take it as incontrovertible that it can not be a family member or one of our crew\nthen our investigation was worth while sir we have eliminated both the delegates and the ships regular complement\ni am referring to the great detectives credo siri quote we must fall back on the old axiom that when other contingencies fail whatever remains however improbable must be the truth\nyes since we obtained only minimal information on our sensor pass of it\na mere change of direction hardly justifies mutiny\nand at the moment it is all pure speculation he has done nothing to subject the enterprise to danger\ni understand as an energy pattern free of the limitations of matter he might travel anywhere at any velocity\nsiri see no way for you to journey with an energy form\nstill no readings no sign of anything\nsir the entity was caught in the ships circuitry the captain might try to get in the same way if he sin trouble\njust as before going to worf first\nhes in the ships circuitry come to the transporter room please there might be away sir hurry\ni knew we had to have the captains physical pattern here sir he was the last one to beam out\nunknown at this time sir i hope the captain remembers his physical pattern is here if he has his energy has moved into the transporter relays by now\nenergising sir\ni believe the captain is now his separate self sir much of what happened is naturally missing\nindubitably sir indubitably\nnot at all lieutenant all equipment online and functioning\nokay come on big guy on your feet here we go thats it\nso worf why the interest in this its just routine maintenance on the sensor assemblies\nnot just the junior ones okay you hold this relay offline while i adjust these sensor circuits\nlieutenant laforge here\nworf laforge to sickbay we h avda medical emergency in sensor maintenance i repeat this is a medical emergency\ni dont know he got hit by some sensor feedback may be\nyou got it doc\nhe was just monitoring the sensor console when he jerked as though something hit him what my sensors showed was a glow just for a second i cant explain it\ni doubt it sir it seemed what i was seeing was something real\nwarp eight sir\nunless there have been some changes i dont know about\naccording to these readings we could go back to warp speed now\nwho else could have corrected it wes inform the bridge of engine status\nsometimes its the result that counts you know what the oh no\nhelm control just went down she wont respond\nwes alert engineering from your panel alright\ncaptain weve just dropped to impulse power\nsir are you all right i thought i just saw\nthe helm is suddenly malfunctioning sir\nsiri was just\nwell theres nothing wrong with it now sir everything is just as it should be\nsir\nyou want to double back on our course sir\nyes sir\nthen he d have to be relieved of command which you could do doctor but its beaucoup trouble if youre wrong\nwere now approaching the cloud sir\naye sir\nso he s just floating around out there how can we settle for that\nwere really leaving him\nmoving in sir but where\nsensors monitoring the

aboard we hope your journey will be pleasant and comfortable arranging that will be my first officer commander riker\nonly because their world was the first on this heading to parliament\nis that all right\neven parliaments peacemakers may find this case a little difficult\nbut do you understand the basis of all this nonsense between them\nreally oh yes well these life forms feel such passionate hatred matters of custom god concepts even strangely enough economic systems\non screen\nchange course to make a close sensor pass we can then increase warp speed and reach parliament on schedule\nlife form reading\nbegin the pass\nany readings of matter there\ncould your visor device have malfunctioned\nobviously you feel its something we should look at more carefully\ni love a mystery data but this one will have to to wait until we deliver the delegates to their peace conference on parliament time and tide lieutenant laforge go to warp eight\ndoctor crusher\nwhat was the diagnosis\ndoctor when such a diagnosis concerns a bridge officer i expect a better explanation\nuse science station two doctor\ndoctor are you all right\ndo you want someone to accompany you\ndata this ship is less than a year out of space dock what are the chances of this occurring\nso what the hell is going on here\nand you are telling me there are no explanations for these malfunctions\nthat was not my question number one what caused the malfunctions\nyes mister singh\nhave you spoken with chief engineer argyle about this problem\nwell im not satisfied i want an explanation of this by the time we reach parliament\nby the time we reach parliament mister singh\npicard to engineering\nwhat is the problem\nstate of the art vessel data signal parliament well be delayed we will send a new arrival time as soon as it is determined\nall right gentlemen your theories on this sudden vulnerability of these systems data\ngentlemen the question is who i cant believe its one of our people\ncan any of you suggest any other suspects\na private consulting investigator data who solves crimes\nin the world of fact probably not however in literature criminal detection can be a fascinating exercise the immortal sherlock holmes would have an interesting view of our mystery i believe\npicard\nwell done warp engines ready on previous heading warp factor six\nwhy didnt you report it\nyour hypnotism revealed another form of duality\ndata lets proceed without the pipe\nyes very unlikely\ndata what are you suggesting\nreport\nim fine everything is fine now why the drop to impulse power lieutenant\nmalfunctioning your e wrong look again\nin that case make our heading nine two five mark three seven\nyou have a problem with that heading lieutenant\nisnt that what i ordered\nthat energy cloud commander i believe it important we have another look at it\ni believe a very important scientific discovery awaits us on this heading\nright data we must go back to learn more counsellor do you believe a ship captain should explain every order\nyes\no hill be glad to do when im free\nwhy what can i do for you number one\nsame question why\ni consider it equally possible that the two of you and counsellor troi are overworked and possibly suffering hallucinations now this is an order you will arrange medical and psychiatric exams of both yourself and them doctor are you aware everybody is behaving strangely\nwhats happened to your mind doctor the search for knowledge is always our primary mission im sorry i really am too busy for this kind of nonsense do i have to call security to force you to report to the sickbay\ncome\nwhat do you want\nhe is here\nand more\nand e lates us we wish you could understand the glorious adventure ahead\nsoon well both be home first officers log supplemental on the orders of captain picard we have returned to the vicinity of the energy pattern cloud i am personally convinced that something from this cloud now shares the captains mind but there seems to be nothing we can do at least within regulations\noh theyre already underway i have an announcement for the entire bridge as many of you suspected when our ship passed through the edge of this it accidentally carried away a sentient being much like these energy patterns were seeing here a terrifying experience for any intelligent being as if a great claw had reached down and scooped one of you from your home world drawn into the energy circuits of this vessel it found its way to you worf frantic at being carried from its homeworld and recognising you as sentient beings it pleaded for help but in ways you couldnt understand desperately going from person to person and then discovering the computer intelligence in this ships memory circuits oh simplistic intelligence but it furnished it enough to slow this enterprise thing that had captured it and it very much regrets the accidental death of engineer singh\nvery soon after we combined we had learned much about each other a passion for exploration for the unknown we found we had similar dreams and it offered your captain a way to realise them beyond human expectations\nisnt there\nthe transporter need not pattern your captain into matter well beam energy only and we will become a combined energy pattern of our life forms a resignation from this command and from starfleet has been appropriately recorded\nhow does this resignation threaten the ship and it screw in any way\nwhat the devil ami doing here\nwhats happening to me number one i was preparing to beam out to somewhere and i remember there was talk of an entity but it all seems so vague\nwhat are you talking about data is this still sherlock holmes\nwell at least you got rid of the damn pipe\nyes lieutenant\nriker with the peace delegates and all i

someone from either alien delegation now if the ferengi could have bought or bribed even one of them thats all that they d need\nyour e sounding like a private eye sir\nbut im afraid were going to have to find our solution without history s greatest consulting detective\nits something the captain mentioned sherlock holmes indubitably data has been studying him\nwhich leaves us with only one conclusion\nmister laforge\nsir im puzzled about your reversing our course\nbut were behind schedule for parliament already\nif he s dangerous if\nonly if all command officers agreed it vital to do so

very tired\nlieutenant this couldnt have waited a moment\nwe can already smell the anti cans they were taken a board first\nwill our quarters be near the anti cans\nno unsatisfactory\nand we must be upwind from the anti cans\nwhat is that doing on our deck\nsorry wrong species\nengineering to captain picard\nwe have something wrong with warp drive circuitry sir\ni believe it was a rampant electronic short that jumped from system to system sir but the only thing is er\nthat shouldnt be possible the affected systems dont generally interact with each other and where they do it wasnt an interlink that was malfunctioning\nwith all the engineering staff sir theyre just as puzzled\nbut sir\nwe have lost the warp engine computer tie\nit bleeds warp engine commands off into dead ends excellent i believe i can handle it from here mister crusher\nyou are scheduled for class work now sorry\ni tend to agree but the captains orders on this are very clear\nneither seem like very promising federation candidates sir\nconfirmed sir my sensors read nothing solid but considerable energy in changing patterns\nsecurity to sensor maintenance\nwere making a close sensor pass on an unusual object geordi any problems\nsensors ready sir\nsorry to call you sir not strictly security its about the dietary requirements of the anti can delegates\nso did we sir their live animals were beamed aboard we were going to preserve the meat for them but they say we must bring it to them alive\nyour food supply is not on the same deck as these lay delegation sir\nthey appear to have the same feelings about you sir\nthank you sir\nthey should our delays are your delays\ni must ask where you were during this vessels earth hours of eighteen hundred last night and zero seven hundred this morning\nsir were talking about hours here\none thing is clear almost all of the peace delegates answered our questions with lies\nwe can learn something from nondisclosure\na foot\nbut since it doesnt show where they went were still in the dark\nyar here\nright away sir\nwhere is he\nthe transporter chief has no idea what the coordinates were sir\ncaptain\nsorry commander but security team two reports theyve discovered a puddle of blood outside these lay quarters and they cant find one of the delegates and so\nits good to see you sir the problem is that one of the cooks has just been asked to broil reptile for the anti cans and it looks like these lay delegate\nhes reading normal now how did you manage that\nare you all right\ndont you remember you were in the sensor maintenance room\nthats a story the doctor will tell you\ni want to try hypnosis on both of you it may restore your memory as to what happened\nbeverly can you hear me\ni want you to go back in your mind to the moment when you first recall this sensation of memory loss picture it exactly as it occurred\nhow do you feel at this moment as you lean over him to take the specimen\nthats almost exactly what you said as though there was something else inside you\nwhich confirms the feeling of duality that i sensed earlier in both of them\nbecause siri assumed at first it was the kind of duality we beta z eds feel in all of you even you sir when you approach a decision and ask yourself which way to go who are you talking to\nyes sir i believe something invaded them\nperhaps you d like to share your reasoning on that sir\nof course not sir\nits just a feeling that he swell that he s closed part of his mind tomei just feel that the captain has become perhaps dangerous\nultimately i believe he will\ncaptain do you exist in combination with this entity\nhes planning to be am himself and the entity into that cloud\nthis is blinding me\ncommander wait its the captain but only the captain hes out there alone\nno but the combination wasnt possible out there hes in trouble sir we have to be am him back\ni wish i could\ntheres some things here i feel it\nbut confused this picard pattern was formed before he went out there\nhim mom your e back early\nphysical sciences class were studying doctor channings theory on dilithium crystals\nreally you never seemed that interested in warp theory before doctor channing thinks its possible to force dilithium into even more useful crystals if as shown here matter and antimatter could be aligned even more efficiently\nthis is engineering not helm control\nmom is something wrong\nhow about here mister singh if the control network breaks at this point\nbut sir\nyes sir but i dont learn nearly this much in school\ni was starting to may be mister singh sent me off to class\nmom ive learned a more than they understand for example the channings dilithium crystals theory i was telling you about\nthis morning dont you remember\nhe could have been working there restoring warp power\nthose arent the same readings as when i left\nhe couldnt have repaired sir the problems were inside the engine\nthat engine computer net wasnt repaired sir it just

but i was brought back to life oj ii awoke in an incredible place and my wounds were gone i had been healed\nlong ago our people believed in beings with great powers these beings made the rains come told the sun when to rise they caused all life to be born to grow to die\nbut perhaps the beliefs of our ancestors are true nothing else can explain what s happened everything is changed now oji we must tell the others\ni understand your skepticism had it not happened to me i would find it difficult to accept as well\nfen to you know the legends better than anyone do they not speak of beings like the kind ive seen\nand couldnt this overseer heal the dead\ni believe i have seen the overseer he is called the picard\nnuria im not saying all the old beliefs are true but i did see the picard and i was restored back to life\ndream it was real\nthat is not reasonable\nit has to be palmer the one the picard wished to find\nthe picard will be pleased\nyes the picard has many servants isnt that true fento\nwe should bind him in case he wakes and tries to escape\nand i heard the picard say he wanted to find palmer\nand hell grant us favours in return\nhe could even bring back those who have died\nanother servant of the picard\ngo\nwhy did you and riker take palmer from us\ndont you realise what youve done youve angered the picard and we may all suffer for it iknow ive seen him he is all powerful\nfan to werent there stories about the overseer destroying those who offended him\nstill the picard may blame us for letting palmer escape perhaps we should punish her let the overseer know\nthat she and riker acted alone\nthats not enough\nif it will hold off the picard sanger yes ive seen how powerful he is\nits not the season for lightning it must be a warning\nit must mean something the picard is angry with us he blames us for letting palmer escape\nwill he also send floods my wife died in last years floods will we all die now we must find nuria\nhali any sign of palmer or riker\nwe must do as the picard wishes punish those responsible\nnuria isnt here we cant wait\ni have no choice i must do as the picard wishes\nwe must do something\npicard we need your guidance is it your wish that this woman should die answer us speak\nthe picard the overseer has come\nbut you have restored my life i am your servant\nthen how was i brought back to life\nno no he can bring back the dead show them picard you can bring my wife back to me\nwhy why wont you do this for me have i failed you in some way are you angry with me\nthen i beg you bring her back to me i will give you my life in exchange please take back what you gave me give it to her let her live\nnothing is beyond your power you are the overseer i will prove it\nbecause their presence would affect us just as it affected me\nwhere\nliko all this talk of supernatural beings no one has believed that for countless generations just as we no longer believe the stars control our fates or the spirits of the dead haunt the living\nplease do we welcome outsiders i am nuria\nremarkable you were speaking the truth\nthis palmer is one of the overseers servants\ni disagree all the evidence indicates that the overseer exists\nfavours\nits agreed we will save palmer for the picard\nfen to stay and bind palmer\noji\nhali yuri dont let her escape\nhe is all right hali find riker and palmer\nliko well get palmer back riker was carrying him they cant have gone far\nwe will keep troi captive\nyou would have us harm her\ni am unwilling to hurt her needlessly we will wait for hali to return\nthen we may have to do as liko suggests\nwho\nyou do not wish it\nnot like me\nbut you are the picard\nwhat a wondrous place even the walls obey your command\nthat is my home\nyet we do not fall in ever imagined i would see the clouds from the other side your powers are truly boundless\nno we have found remnants of tools in caves our ancestors must have lived there\nhuts are better caves are dark and wet\nthe most reasonable explanation would be that at one time we didnt know how to make huts\nthat would be reasonable\ni dont know\nonly because i have a bow\ni suppose she might think so\ni think she would fear me\ni do not fear you any longer\nperhaps one day my people will travel above the skies\npicard you have shown me wonders i could never have imagined and i am grateful beyond words might i request something for my people\nyou have shown me such generosity i wish my people could share in it six mint a kans died in a flood last winter four of them children would you bring them back to life\nwhy you restored li kos life did the six who died offend you in some way did i offended you should i have ordered the death of troi please you must tell me if there s anything i can do to change your mind\npicard you could not save her\nyou do have limits you are not masters of life and death\nyou are a remarkable people but you are not superior beings my people must be made to understand that\npicard speaks the truth i have visited his people i have seen how they live and how they die when death takes one of their loved ones they are as helpless as we are\nliko you were not dead pi cards people have a knowledge that we lack they are able to heal wounds that we can not\nliko\nliko dont do it\nwhat is that\npicard why should a people so advanced want to learn about us\nso we will

generous worf but he s not a klingon child he has different sensibilities\nright now there is nt much he can understand hes holding all his feelings inside children often feel they must be true to the

deal to you but you must be prepared hes very angry too but his anger is deep inside him when he touches it it will strike out in many directions including yours be with him talk to him but dont rush

asked beverly if we might get wesley to talk to jeremy about his fathers death the one unusual element is worf\nin many ways hes suffering as badly as the boy he wishes to involve jeremy in a klingon

doc\nyeah down to work your e absolutely right\ncomputer generate a cross section image of the dilithium crystal chamber what about reorienting the crystal\nsorry cant wait you and me leah we ve got just two hours to figure this thing out you know what i need to do i need to get inside there i need to be able to turn that thing inside out computer is there a cross section image we can replicate on a holodeck\nprototype elaborate\nperfect recreate it in holodeck three stay with me doc\nready computer\ndamn right back where it all started whoa this is incredible leah did you design this\nthats the visiting dignitary talk whats the inside story off the record\ngreat another woman who wont get personal with me in the holodeck leah i want to find a way to supplement the energy supply to the ship and to the engines could we alter the matter antimatter paths\nwell this is your baby show me which ones\ncomputer didi ask for a simulation\ni did do that didnt i okay well its good to see you leah continue your analysis\nthen if we use multiple injector streams hitting more than one crystal facet we could do it we could hold our own leah your e beautiful laforge to picard\ncaptain weve found a way to extend the matter antimatter energy supplies\nsorry commander we have nt addressed that one yet first priority was to maintain the shields\nwell get to work on it right away sir\nthanks captain were all smiles down here\n452throughsysteml575\nimpact analysis computer\nyes all right computer do you have any you know personality on file for doctor brahms\ndid she ever debate at the intergalactic caucuses on chaya seven\nnever mind the dates computer if you add data from all these sources could you synthesise a true representation of doctor brahms\ni can live with that do it doctor brahms\nright\nyeah yeah yeah\nno no no\nyou cant boost the warp power that way\ni want to give us enough power to strengthen the shields and barrel out of here not blow us up\ni dont care if you built it with your bare hands out of an old ferengi cargo ship its going to go and were going with it\nand im not used to dying okay look you worked in a lab on a static model this is a working machine its got tens of thousands of light years on it\ndamn right listen wed never be certain that the circuit paths are sealed\ni know my ship inside and out\nyou know i always wished that a chief engineer could be present when a ship is being built\nwell youre there now\non my way commander dont go away i mean computer save programme\nwe wont be able to maintain energy reserves we might even lose a few circuits in the new configuration\nnot enough to shut down our engines but if we dont make it i dont know that i can hold the shields\nwouldnt that increase the output of the subspace processors to gain a quicker response time\nyeah but how do were configure\ncomputer override standard procedure\nwhat computer\nthe crystal lattice is breaking down well have to pick up repairs when we can reach a starbase riker\nyes sir in fact i need to get some back im running a programme on holodeck three\nwell ive gone back to the beginning\nto the earliest construction entries of the enterprise ive created a propulsion design model to assist me\ni believe were making progress\ncomputer resume holodeck three programme\nsomehow we have to generate enough energy to get out of here but we ve got a booby trap that eats energy for breakfast how do we fool it block it shut it down anything okay we know for every movement the enterprise makes theresa counter movement by the energy field can we use that to our advantage somehow\nyeah yes leah you like italian food\nokay fusion reactor up link to navigation processor\nbut then we have to adjust the vector processor and the drive coils this is impossible\ndont do that\ni dont want to feel that good right now what time is it\ngod what ami supposed to tell the captain its possible and yet its not possible everything weve done says we cant adjust that fast but if we could it might work\ndata couldnt even do it itll take a hundred maybe even a thousand adjustments every second how are you going to do it its humanly impossible\nyou mean the computer could do it\ncaptain captain this is a holographic simulation of one of the propulsion experts who designed the enterprise engines leah brahms weve ive been examining the force counterforce response times trying to see if we could create linkage at maximum power\ntheres a chance we could manoeuvre out of this trap if we turn the ship over to the computer\ni dont know yet but we could programme it and try it out on a few simulated runs\ni think so sir\ncomputer reduce thrust levels another four percent adjust trajectory angle to compensate begin simulation again\nrepeat simulation same levels\nyou see same variables only this time the computer didnt quite make it\nand it might not i can task captain picard to turn the ship over to a computer\ncaptain\ntwo minutes give me just two minutes\nthere is another way captain two minutes please\nno nowait listen turn it completely around literally come at it from the opposite direction god its so simple it might even work okay computer new simulation\neverything weve tried to do has been based on overpowering the trap more energy faster adjustments but thats exactly what we cant do because thats what were supposed to do thats the booby trap the answer lies in our own computer the mind the best piece of engineering well ever need\nnot if we shut everything off one blast of everything we ve got left for a microsecond to be at the inertia and then we shut it all down except minimal life support and two thrusters no impulse engines no computer\nthe numbers say it seven money its no better than turning it over to the computer but no worse either but i say forget the numbers theres no way the computer can compensate for the human factor the intuition the experience\nive run the simulations captain if you want ill take the conn\nshutting down all systems\nwith pleasure sir\nyou know ive always thought that technology could solve almost any problem it enhances the quality of our lives lets us travel across the galaxy even gave me my vision but sometimes you have to turn it all off even the gypsy violins\ndifferent programme\nmaybe we can do it

unless they are prepared to do battle\na mission to recover one of your officers who has been caught on a federation planet for reasons as yet unknown\nand i have rejected your explanation\ncommander i am singularly impressed by your concern for a life do not risk anymore lives by leaving the neutral zone picard out\nassemble an away team\nbelay that order number one red alert\ncome\nyes lieutenant i assume you know what its about\nthe romulan ship will reach us within the hour if our patient dies it may be just the excuse the romulan commander needs to start an incident the death of a romulan officer at the hands of the federation think of it\nso there is no question that the romulan officer is more valuable to usa live than dead\nlieutenant sometimes the moral obligations of command are less than clear i have to weigh the good of the many against the needs of the individual and try to balance them as realistically as possible god knows i dont always succeed\noh lieutenant you wouldnt complain even if you had cause\ni dont want to order you but i ask you i beg you to volunteer\nlieutenant\nthat will be all\npicard to doctor crusher\ndo not continue to enlist the

the hail all channels you see they have no way of knowing how accurate our sensors are put on your best poker face number one open a frequency commander tomalak it would appear our away team has rescued a second man from your one man ship were preparing to be am them to the enterprise after which of course we will return the survivor to you\ncommander both our ships are ready to fight we have two extremely powerful and destructive arsenals at our command our next actions will have serious repercussions we have good reason to mistrust one another but we have better reasons to set our differences aside now of course the question is who will take the initiative who will make the first gesture of trust the answer is iwill i must lower our shields to be am these men up from the planet surface once the shields are down you will of course have the opportunity to fire on us if you do you will destroy not only the enterprise and its crew but the ceasefire that the romulans and the federation now enjoy lieutenant lower the shields leave the hailing frequency open\nmister obrien transport mister laforge and the romulan directly to the bridge\nbelay that order lieutenant shields up no one is going to harm you\nwell commander\ntomalak how is it possible you didnt know of the second romulan on galor nd on core\nof course not\nlets just say my faith would be strengthened by a

to you captain picard for hosting these negotiations the barzan has been a society dependent on others for generations we want that to end the appearance of this stable wormhole in our space provides

was another fellow i fell in love in a day it lasted a week but what a week then i met jack it took months to figure it out with him\nno\nthe data from the barzan s probe of the wormhole are quite impressive captain the wormhole delivered the probe beyond the den kiri arm in the gamma quadrant\nthe same distance could be achieved in a matter of seconds through the wormhole\nthe barzan s do not have manned space travel so they had to resort to an automated probe its findings are limited it can not be determined from these chart shows table the wormhole really is or how long it will remain intact\nproverbial lemon\ni would also like to volunteer sir\nthere is a bright side geordi you will have me to talk to\nit is visible captain\nand intense energy fields which appear to be stabil\nmonitors are functioning normally again\ncurious we are not where we are supposed to be\naccording to the barzan probe we should be in the gamma quadrant but these readings clearly indicate we are nearly two hundred light years away in sector three five five six of the delta quadrant\nperhaps the readings were correct their probe could have exited the wormhole at a completely different location\ngravitational acceleration is also increasing\nthis is not a speculation doctor we are not where the barzan s said we should be which would indicate\nthis side of the wormhole is not stable\nthrusters at half power three quarters\ncaptain this end of the wormhole is currently stable but the other end apparently shifts positions periodically\nthe barzan probe had no way to recognise this eventually both sides will be unstable\non behalf of all ferengi i protest why were we not invited to these negotiations\nmy name is daimon goss these are my consuls kol and doctor ar

suffice\nid say it is time to extend the hand of the ferengi to the representative of the federation\nyou attempt to gain every unfair advantage picard\nwell i most certainly do first you conveniently arrange to play host then you plan to send your own manned probe into the wormhole the federation thinks it can do anything it wants to well i will not tolerate it\nand you expect us to believe what you report\nthats exactly what i intend to do and i should strongly suggest you stay out of our way\nive learned from informed sources that the federation has manipulated these negotiations from the very beginning and has already signed a secret agreement with the barzan s\nthe ferengi offer was never seriously considered\nwe will be ignored no longer\nif the ferengi can not have the wormhole no one will\ncasualties of war commander my men are prepared to die are yours\ni have nothing to say to your al\ni have your word on this\nthis is an acceptable offer\nbut i was tensei was ready to blow

too\nwhat do you mean were on the other side of the wormhole arent we\nmay be the barzan readings were wrong\ndata my visors picking up subatomic fluctuations meson and lepton activity is definitely increasing\nsomething very strange is happening to this wormhole\nim telling you its changing\ni can see it with my visor\nlisten doctor\nyour readings must be telling you the same things were getting

agreed that one representative would suffice now i will be happy to provide your consuls with accommodations and you may have my chair\npremier\nit would take nearly a century at warp nine to cover

wind up buying a proverbial lemon\nlater data\nnobodys going in there until we have done a full sensor analysis i want to do everything possible to determine that its safe and when i am satisfied then you data and commander laforge will enter the wormhole tomorrow\npremier bhavani has no objection\ni will gladly share the results of our exploration with all the delegates\ntell data and laforge to do themselves a favour and stay out of their way\nacknowledged doctor\nwill you keep me informed\nthe federation stop negotiator taken out by a mysterious ailment suspicions\nyoull have to fill in

the stakes are higher but then isnt that when the game gets interesting commander\nshuttle nine standby\nproceed when ready\ncomputer is the ferengi goss still onboard the enterprise\nyellow alert hail the ferengi\nrequest an explanation of your actions daimon goss\nthat is not true\npremier bhavani welcomed you to these proceedings despite my better judgment\ndestroy it\ngoss has fired a missile at the wormhole\ni need you on the bridge number one\nyou must know we will not allow you to do this\na missile will have no destructive effect on a wormhole but if it should explode near the

the delta quadrant he may run into them in eighty years or so\nand im devin on ir al\nmy good friend mendoza means that ima negotiator who serves a variety of clients on this particular occasioni represent the chrys a lians\nshould i call for an appointment\nwell thats too bad i thought you might be thinking about me\nin recess in ever play the opening rounds anyway inconsequential besides there are much better things to negotiate on this ship like dinner tonight\nmy travelling companion is travelling i sent her home\nyou know why\ndont do that\ndont do counsellor troi\nyes you were when you leave this office who are you oh so that show it goes you never do you never do leave the office\nshush\ndinner at eight\nmuch better\nah federation decor\nwell conformity is not my style\nid even like another there she is again counsellor troi\nfor two ami moving too fast for you\ni like that better\nyou must have had a nice day\nvery late\ncommander i realise what a difficult position this must be for you if you dont understand something i hope you wont be too embarrassed to ask me\nwell thats what makes it so interesting the rules of the game change to fit the moment\nwell mister rikers placed a great deal of emphasis on defence a subject he obviously knows well having served starfleet in a number of conflicts now the chrys ali answer e enemies to no one and we choose to remain that way neutral\nno one would claim that the chrys a lians areas powerful as the mighty federation but we have resources and technology and scientists too but we also have had peace for ten generations\nyou know i was thinking\nmay be i could stretch out these negotiations for a few days would you like that\nwell what do your beta zoid senses tell you about me\ngood\ni rather like it that im more difficult to read than your other men\nwhat about commander riker\nno one no one i just sensed something when i saw the two of you together\nahha\nah\ndont you have enough people talk about their lives to you who counsels the counsellor\nim what you see right now just me wanting to run away with you but knowing you d never leave this damned ship\ndoes it matter well it will when i tell you but you must promise never to tell anyone else\ni am part beta zoid too my mother was one half i am one quarter\nthe only one of five children i must admit i was never as comfortable sensing emotions as you seem to be\nyes i learned to live with it use it as you have but still it isolates us doesnt it and i thought it would always would so i tucked my heart away i didnt need it i didnt want it at the negotiating table it can be fatal to have a heart but i never realised how much i needed mine until i looked at you\nto be honest i was surprised to see the caldonia ns here at all ley or\noh no no not at all not at all on the contrary ive respected your worlds commitment to pure research its just that well\nwell scholars dont always enjoy administrative demands and certainly weve seen here that the administration of the wormhole is\nyes yes im sure you have ley or im sure we all have do you realise that in the next century the number of ships that will pass\nsome people just dont wish to transact business with the federation commander the chrys a lians hereby add the caldonia ntrillium323toitsbid premier\nwell the opening was there i took it\nlet me tell you something about commander riker hes good hes the most dangerous man in the room to me\nour edge you make it sound unethical\ndeanna its just business\nbecause i find it makes people uncomfortable\nwell i gained an advantage by using it with you you didnt seem to mind that look deanna the point of negotiating is to take advantage i dont know what the other side is offering and they dont know what im offering so we dance around each other until somebody wins i never cry foul when i lose\nwell people have been doing that for thousands of years just by listening carefully by watching body language i just happen to be better at it you do it\noh so you announce it to every alien culture you encounter or do you use it to give your side an advantage do you tell the romulan thats about to attack that you sense that he may be bluffing or do you just tell it to your captain\nyes protection your protection your captain your crew your edge yes now its a matter of life and death when you take the advantage me ideal in property exchanges nobody gets hurt so you tell me which one of us would you say has more of a problem with ethics excuse me\nmay i join you commander\nthink i should give it a try\nyou know your every good at this very good much better than you realise\nthe last mile of the marathon is always the toughest thats when the winners are willing to take the big risks are you willing to do that\nwell lets see now im prepared to reach a firm agreement with bhavani before we learn the outcome of your probes expedition are you well well well that would not be looked upon favourably by the federation id imagine see you have to be willing to take that last step alone or it just isnt worthplaying\nohi see that commander i see that otherwise you wouldnt be second in command of this starship you know i feel responsible for you in a way related deanna we both love deanna oh in different ways of course\nof course it does of course it does its just that well shes an extraordinary woman brilliant lovely very passionate and she could have been yours will but you just didnt do enough to keep her and now well im here and im going to take her too\nexcuse me for saying so under the circumstances premier but this fight is really between the federation and the ferengi now it seems unconscionable that your wormhole is being used as a pawn in their power struggle\ncaptain i believe i am in a better position to settle this with daimon goss than you are may i address him\ndaimon goss this is devin on ir al\nwell then just listen the planet barzan has reached an agreement with the chrys a lians for long term control of the wormhole now on behalf of the chrys ali ansi am prepared to offer the ferengi free access to the wormhole in perpetuity\nyes my words irin exchange for ferengi convoy privileges to be negotiated in good faith\nno not at all\nwell after all it was a very tense situation\npardon me captain i believe theres a slight conflict of interest here\ni take the risks mister riker and i standby my agreements\nsoon ive been recalled by the chrys a lians explanations demanded and so forth\nive done well for them over the years they understand the stakes it ll be fine i had to do it troi bhavani was ready to go with the federation i sensed it id used up every card in the deck i needed to change the rules\nmy human physical response must have been blocking my beta zoid sense sim very grateful for what you did in away its made me take a hard look at who iam i dont like what is eei once asked you to run away with me now im asking again i need you you could help me change you could be my conscience\nmay i escort you miss troi\nexcuse me theresa delegation of ferengi who wishes to be beamed aboard sir\ngentlemen this way\nimagine the ferengi collecting tolls if we lose to them\ni think that devin on iis the one that we need to watch out for\nhe was the most one in the group\npoker is that a game of some sort\na wormholes is there one moment and then gone the next a stable wormhole is unheard of\nwe think we should take a look for ourselves\ngeordi has continuous visual contact with the wormhole captain i think hes the logical choice\nthen send in your own probe goss\nwith the ferengi around always\nme\nexcuse me sir but those werent natural instincts those were poker instincts a card game doesnt exactly prepare me for this\na complete analysis of our bid is available on the ships computer for your consideration\ni think i have an idea what the rules are\nnot unlike commanding a starship mister ral\nneutral and uninvolved sir in virtually all interstellar matters of consequence\nley or the federation would like to negotiate a trade agreement in which we could acquire your planets rich deposits of trillium 323 which we would add to our bid premier bhavani\nmister ral you either had very good instincts or foreknowledge of the caldonia n withdrawal\nbought out the ferengi yet ral\nno but i think that you will one way or another its going to come down to you and me\ni hope im better than you realise\nwell see wont we\nyour point of view not mine\ni will remove the burden of that responsibility right now my relationship with deanna stands very well on its own without any help from you\nthats the first bad play ive seen you make if you can bring happiness into deanna s life nothing would please me more you know your e really not such a bad sort ral except you dont have any values beyond the value of todays bid that is deanna is just the woman to bring some meaning to your sorry existence if youre smart enough to take it i doubt that you are to the last mile\nriker to picard whats happening captain\nexcuse me\nwhy what is he doing it for then\nmister ral congratulations on winning the rights to the barzan wormhole\ncomputer dispatches\ntransfer the letters from my mother to the viewscreen and computer i would like a real chocolate sundae\nreal not one of your perfectly synthesised ingeniously enhanced imitations i would like real chocolate ice cream real whipped cream\nlisten\nnow what yes captain\ncaptain im not really dressed for a reception\nof course captain im on my way\ngod forbid i should miss my first look at the wormhole\njust tell me theres some chocolate here\nyour discovery has produced a great deal of excitement premier\nships counsellor deanna troi\nhired gun\ncome in\nnoi was just looking over some personnel files\ni thought you dbe deep in negotiations by now\nwhat about your travelling companion\nwhy\nwerent you getting along\nwhat\nwas i\nwhat\nthank you come in for a drink\nnot your style\nwhat would you like\nim not computer champagne\nno im moving too fast for me\ni havent been able to stop thinking about you all day\nanticipation is fun well be late for dinner\nmmm\nmmm hmmm devin on i ral who are you\nnot much my human physical response must be blocking them out\nit never happened to me before\nthere arent any others currently\nwho have you been talking to\nwill riker andi are good friends\nit was once a little more than that\nhow come were talking about me instead of you\nohno i want to know about you\nwhen i first saw you i felt as if id been waiting for you im trying to understand why or how thats possible\nwhat\nyour e empathic\nthats why you left earth\nsorry\nill say devin on ir al its ridiculous and wonderful i feel completely out of control happy terrified but there s nothing rational about this\nim afraid im going to lose myself i cant get enough of him is it possible to fall in love in one day\nit was like this for you and jack\nwell then maybe i should slow down catch my breath not let this get out of control\nno\neveryone was talking today about the way you absorbed the caldonia n bid\ncommander riker didnt know how you managed it\nbut he doesnt have an edge your edge\nisnt it\nwhy havent you told anyone your e an empath\ni think you dont tell them so you can gain an advantage\nbut you rereading their emotional states their inner selves and then using that to manipulate them\ni do it to help my crew not out manoeuvre them and i dont hide that iman empath\nthats different thats a matter of protection\ncaptain hes lying im almost sure of it he doesnt mean what he says\nexcuse me premier theres something you should know im sorry was there something you wanted to say\ni sensed you suddenly felt uncomfortable\nbut thats what sso odd it wasnt tense at all in fact i sensed no tension from you or goss\nit was as though you were performing a scene for all of us\ni agree entirely mister ral asked me not to tell anyone he has empathic powers which he uses to manipulate his competitors in a negotiation and yes it did put me in a conflict of interest which i hope i have now resolved premier i believer al has used your fear of continuing aggression between the federation and its enemies to undermine our position i also believe that this incident was staged by ral and goss to provide you a reason to choose in favour of the chrys a lians\ncome in when do you leave\nim sorry\nyou must have known i couldnt allow you to do that\ni already have a job as

feed and clothe us too\nland do we look like farmers to you\nwe will need autonomy\nyes and those rights will be spelled out before i agree to anything\nif were going to be subject to your laws we

alive\ncommander i am in your debt\nclan affiliation is not within provided records\ncommander take a look at this\nyes but not human im going to have to do some analysis on it\nthe two scientists are suffering from phaser stuns id guess several hits each\nitll take us awhile to bring them around but they will recover we found a sample of blood its a rare iron copper composite unique to one humanoid species the aca marian s\nhes been dead too long\ncardiac arrest\nno he died of a heart attack all right but i cant find the cause his cardiac muscle is strong and theres no sign of arterial occlusion\nsickbay to commander riker ive discovered something interesting will\nim thinking\nthe old gatherer on the planet i know what caused his heart attack the medical tricorder almost missed it but there was a micro virus in his body blocking his autonomic nerve impulses\nbut heres the really interesting part this micro virus will only attach itself to cells which contain a very specific sequence\nwithout knowing more about their genetic makeup i cant be sure but my guess is this virus would only kill one aca marian in a million\ntoo single minded i cant believe its a naturally occurring virus\nmeaning vol not h was murdered\ncommander ive been digging through the medical database from a ca mar three for hours and i have found another victim of the same micro virus that killed vol not h but only one fifty three years ago a gatherer named pen thor mul\nlorna k the same clan\nif these microbes were engineered for murder id say somebody could be going after a whole family\nmore ways than i can count and its perfectly safe to the carrier as long as he doesnt have the same patterns\nsomething tells me they were nt all been wiped out\ncomputer any members of the aca marian delegation from the tral esta clan\ncommander i am detecting life signs from behind that door\nit is a likely hypothesis the nomadic marauders who refer to themselves as gatherers have raided other outposts in neighbouring sectors\nthe federation has charted but not explored several class m planets in that area any one of these planets might well serve as a base\ncaptain i am detecting life readings from the planet surface as well as several small areas of thermal radiation and carbon dioxide emissions indicative of combustion\nis that not what is aid\nnora nium alloy sir

request for access to their databases they are now being transmitted into our computer over subspace link\ncommander im afraid the only entry we have on vol nothin the aca marian database is a birth record\nyes sir he was a member of the lorna k clan he was captured while leading a gatherer raid on a naca marian outpost he died of a heart attack before his trial ended\ncommander ch organ the present leader of the gatherers is also from the lorna k clan\ncommander eighty years ago the lorna ks massacred a rival clan the tral est as it ended a feud that had lasted for two hundred years\naccording to these records there were no survivors the tral estas were annihilated\nsiri believe i have found a correlation between the two deaths your missing link that is pen thor mul being led from his trial\nbehind him and to the left sir\nthe computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of the face sir\nhow specific\ntailor made for their enemies\nart on ian lasers tonk ian homing beacons quite a collection\nsettings even ought to do it\nthe gatherers are elusive weve only managed to capture a handful of them but with the starfleet s help\nreconciliation with the gatherers is impossible its been tried every time weve offered amnesty theyve rejected it\neighteen years ago\nfor almost a century now they ve been parasites moving from star system to star system living on what they could find or steal\nno captain you have to understand our history a hundred years ago before the gatherers split off from our culture we were a savage violent race clans battled clans bloody vengeful feuds that lasted for generations but we overcame those ways all except for the gatherers\nthe attempt may be futile\nthank you captain\ni am ready now captain i need only bring

dead\nfor centuries my planet was in chaos loyalty to ones clan was absolute the slightest injury to one member demanded violent retaliation\nthe obsession with vengeance would be passed from generation to generation and with each act of retribution the violence would escalate\nof course yuta\nyuta\nquite simply i am proposing amnesty for every gatherer\ni didnt believe this very persuasive federation captain when he suggested that we could reconcile our differences im convinced now its the right thing not just for you but for us too we need you back ive brought some aca marian brandy im sure its been a long time\nno by accepting you back as freemen\nno ofcourse i wont what i will do is give you the means to feed and clothe yourselves weve set aside some land and you

unpalatable to you i am truly sorry but i will not risk the lives of my crew because you think you can dance on the edge of the neutral zone youve crossed over admiral you make yourself comfortable

fleet mister laforge he is prepared to give you data regarding engines weapons and the cloaking systems of the warbird class starship but i believe his experience as a field commander will be more

dangerous commander lunar five is a maximum security facility\ncaptain weve identified the prisoner his name is rog adana r his criminal record is too long to go into but i must caution you that he is given to bouts of uncontrollable violence\nwell need a few hours to get the containment field on lunar five operational before we pick him up the damage he did during his escape was considerable\ni appreciate your patience the prison psychologist recommends that you keep dana r fully sedated until hes ready for transport\ndo not relax your security for an instant captain he is extremely violent and very cunning as you already know i will send a transport vessel to pick him up as soon as possible nay rok out\ncaptain what this man has been telling you is full of half truth shes a prisoner what do you expect him to say about us\nthe soldiers were resettled on lunar five it was to be their colony\nit was for their own protection as well as that of others most of them were quite happy there we went to great lengths to give them a fine quality of life\nunfortunately a few agitators like dana r forced us to add security\ncaptain i assure you that every alternative has been explored

your security men\nthey have been seen moving toward the center of the city people are scared dont you understand captain theyre dangerous\nno one was pleased with the solution but we had to act for the greater good\nthe chemicals can be removed from their systems but were not convinced that the psychological conditioning can ever be entirely reversed\nwe studied it thoroughly even before the training began we knew there would be problems reversing it it was a risk we had to take\nwe were helping them to survive the war you understand they needed these skills\nthere was a referendum the people weighed the costs involved they chose the resettlement solution\ndo as he says\nyou are programmed to survive you can survive at the lunar five settlement\ni am not prepared to negotiate under

enemy who fails to register on any scanner until they re literally standing in front of you pointing a phaser at your head\nnot much really they first started using it two months ago weve taken several of these off dead terrorists our people have looked at them nothing they can explain\nnot a tall and ill put you in touch with our research people if you wish\nperhaps if we found ourselves in possession of some of that advanced federation weaponry of yours it would shift the balance of power back to our favour\nyes of course\nif you like\ni know my enemy commander they dont leave much room for optimism\nno not really we suspect the organisation itself only to consist of some two hundred members there are over five thousand names on this list citizens we know to be sympathetic to their cause they pass along weaponry and information march inpro an sata demonstrations participate in general strikes or the occasional riot\nseventy years ago we denied them independence that gave them a noble cause now its just an excuse for more violence\nbelieve it or not i always considered myself moderate\nbeing stationed here for six months watching the body count grow the three assassination attempt son my life\nthe event that really opened my eyes took place only a few days after my arrival a terrorist bomb destroyed a shuttle bus sixty school children there were no survivors the ans at

will\nfor us or them\ni know its not pretty riker but this is what terrorism has done to this city\nmy methods may seem harsh but believe me theyre gentle compared to my predecessors suspects would be

you ve misunderstood\nall they want is to get me back safely\nto find a way to reverse the effects of the dimensional shift i can do that right now stop using it i have a life finn i have a son who needs me\nyes\nno\nwe are not your enemy\nplease\nplease finn dont do this i will do anything you ask\nwas wes on the bridge\nyes they needed a doctor\nyes\nhes had good role models im sorry if id

meeting doctor\ndoctor i believe it would be prudent to return to the enterprise there are physicians on this planet\ncaptain there has been an incident\na bomb has been detonated by an sata terrorists\nvulnerable sir\nsir ive recommended such a course but there are several wounded people and doctor crusher\nis insisting on attending to\naye sir\na transporter would leave residual

shielded location\na subspace field coil with an isolated power source curious\nthat could possibly indicate subspace transition rebound during transport\nare you referring to the elway theorem\nbut the elway theorem proved to be entirely inaccurate all research was abandoned by the mid twenty third century\nbut it was proven to be fatal to use this technology would be an irrational act\ncaptain anyone who is willing to transport in this manner would suffer significant internal damage that could be detected\na dimensional jump can create subspace pressure modulation captain by setting up a magnetosphere echo gram that can monitor each of their movements we may be able to collect enough data to trace their power source\ndimensional shifting is such an unstable procedure sir that i can not say siri am finding it difficult to understand many aspects of an sata conduct much of their behavioral norm would be defined by my programme as unnecessary and unacceptable\nbut if that is so captain why are their methods so often successful i have been reviewing the history of armed rebellion and it appears that terrorism is an effective way to promote political change\nyet there are numerous examples where it was successful the independence of the mexican state from spain the irish unification of 2024 and the kensey rebellion\nthen would it be accurate to say that terrorism is acceptable when all options for peaceful settlement have been foreclosed\ncasualties reported on deck twelve sickbay responding\nthey are moving inter dimensionally neither transporters nor force

anything\ni doesnt matter to me you want to be hungry be hungry whats your name youre a doctor on a federation starship i always wondered what it would be like to travel across the galaxy its not something ive exactly had time for this isnt the best way to meet new people is it if you need anything ask for me my name is kyril finn they know me\nyou hungry you want something to eat relax relax im just going to\nnow eat something whats the point of not eating your e the only one who suffers doi look like its bothering me okay its bothering me come on\nno forks sorry did i mention my name is finn and your e\ni need a doctor\ni need someone better i heard you were with the federation flagship and i knew you had to be\ni heard now youll help me just like you helped them\nyour ship carries medical supplies for them for the other side why does the federation ally itself with the rut ians\nmedical supplies\ni know i hurt them you refinished eating get up get up\nyoull be with him again doctor i see no reason to kill you\nyou think if i allow you to contact your ship they will transport the instruments\nand since the federation does not wish to take sides they will send the supplies that you need\nive anticipated your needs\ni heard\nyou cant do anything\nyou could reverse the damage\nits the inverter its given our cause a new life but it asks for our lives in return\nwe transport through a dimensional shift that the ruti an sensors cant trace\nthere are risks the designers told us but it works\nit doesnt matter\ndont you know a dead martyrs worth ten posturing leaders\ni can do both\ni take my killing very seriously doctor you are an idea list\nyour origins on earth are from the american continent are they not\nyes ive read your history books this is a war for independence and i am no different than your own george washington\nthe difference between generals and terrorists doctor is only the difference between winners and losers you win you recalled a general you lose\nhow much innocent blood has been spilled for the cause of freedom in the history of your federation doctor how many good and noble societies have bombed civilians in war have wiped out whole cities and now that you enjoy the comfort that has come from their battles their killing you frown on my immorality i am willing to die for my freedom doctor and in the finest tradition of your own great civilisation im willing to kill for it too\nbecause of her\nwhile they arrange for the ruti an police to fill up the detention cells\nim sure he does your federation colleagues have engineered mass arrests to pressure me into releasing you\ntheyre working with the police hes seen it with his own eyes\nim not releasing you i need you here\nis your son on the ship\nim sorry hes on the ship\nthey have joined forces with the rut ians against us\nthey are more valuable to me than an enemy for seventy years we have shouted and no ones heard us destroy the federation flagship someone will listen\nthey are the ones who interfered they are the ones who sent medical supplies they are the ones who organised mass arrests they are killing your son not me\ni had a son too he was thirteen when he died in detention\ni didnt kill your son beverly we were nt able to destroy the ship we had to settle for him she wouldnt even tell me her name i call her doctor\noh\non the contrary im counting on it\ncaptain the federation has a lot to admire in it but theres a hint of moral cowardice in your dealings with nonaligned planets your e doing business with a government that is crushing us and you say your e not involved your every very much involved you just dont want to get dirty\ni am been fighting the only war that i can against an intractable enemy now im fighting a big war against a more powerful adversary cant you see how that helps me\nyou added the chair captain i am simply forcing you to sit in it the federation will quickly tire of our little war theyll want you back they will want to get as far away from rut ia as they can and i will not make it easy eventually the federation will force the government in to make concessions and then a few more and then a

understand how but it is asking me if i was constructed for information exchange\ni was an excellent choice for them captain they were able to communicate with me quite i was about to say quite easily but there was nothing easy about it fortunately they stopped short of overloading my circuitry\ndefinitely not a single entity if thats what you mean sir although they know the edo worship them as a god thing\nthey recognise that this is quite expected and harmless at the presented o stage of evolution\nit is perhaps not what we would understand as a vessel sir the dimensions this one occupies allows them to be well to be in several places at once but they consider this entire star cluster to be theirs it was probably unwise of us to attempt to place a human colony in this area of course there are three thousand four other planets in this star cluster in which we could have colonised the largest and closest\nbabble sir im not aware that i ever babble sir it may be that from time to time i have considerable information to communicate and you may question the way i organise it\nundecided sir\ni volunteer that they are now observing us sir\nno it is more curiosity siri doubt that they expect us to abide by their value systems\nthey know everything i know sir\nit would be a case of judging usb your own rules sir if we violate our own prime directive they might consider us to be

sir\nbut i do sir\nthe problems iris there although they ve learned of the prime directive from my mind how will they evaluate it how do they reason what are their values remember their warning to us sir\nwould you choose one life over one thousand sir\nany sufficiently advanced life form would appear to others to be that sir but when they were probing my thoughts captain i could feel that whatever they are now they once existed in this dimension just as we do perhaps in the same kind of flesh and blood form since then however they have evolved considerably their present existence in

never intended that\nexactly how do i explain my refusing to obey their laws down there not permitting the crusher boy to be executed and by so doing doi endanger this vessel and more than a thousand other lives\ni refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that did you learn anything about the relationship between that and the edo why are they so certain its a god\nthen in some earlier flesh

everything captain\nno sir\nthe tanu gans are right something was fired at the reactor core just before transport\nnot that is a w besides how do you account for the fact that it came from commanders rikers exact position damnit i should have stayed with him\ni dont recognise it not even the main deflector puts out that kind of spillage\ni dont know we s but whatever it is its capable of putting a hole in solid d uranium\nif this should happen in the engine core or the antimatter containment tanks well be in big trouble captain\nwere expecting it in just over five hours\nits the field generator that apgar during in his research when its fully charged it automatically emits an energy pulse and then takes five hours twenty minutes and three seconds to recharge itself\nbut we knew that somehow it was related to our radiation bursts and then the pieces started just falling together\nfor the last several hours the enterprise has been experiencing unusual radiation bursts weve identified them as krieger waves\nfrom right here inside the holodeck\nincluding the krieger wave converter that doctor apgar claimed didnt work except it does work\nwell it didnt when you get down to basics the converter is nothing more than a complex series of mirrors and reflective coils the energy from the field generator down on the planet simply reflects off of elements in the convertor which turns it into highly focused krieger waves\nbut if he could turn this into a weapon it would be worth a lot to the romulans the ferengi and a few others now doctor apgar had been ordering extra di cos ilium for months thats a pretty good indication that he was trying to create larger reflective coils\nwe are hypothesis ing that doctor apgar energised the converter at the moment of commander rikers beam out hoping to make his death look like a transporter accident but something went wrong the energy pulse hit the transporter beam and reflected back to the reactor which caused the explosion\nnot really we know that the field generator on the planet has been repeating a discharge ever since the explosion the intervals are like clockwork except the explosion occurred point zero zero one four seconds after the initial discharge and the only explanation for that variance is the time it would take the energy pulse to bounce back from the transporter beam to the reactor\ncomputer load programme laforge one coordinate auto engage time sequence the next discharge from the field generator is scheduled to occur in just a few moments and weve aligned the holodeck programme to recreate the final events as commander riker described them only this time our facsimile will automatically process the energy charge from the planet and reflect it just as the original convertor did before the explosion\ndont be in such a hurry dear perhaps our guests would care for some refreshments\nreally darling your e being rude after all commander riker is willing to sit through all your prattle about krieger waves lets have a drink commander and well hear all about krieger waves\nand the rewards that come with it\nhow interesting tell us about this other mission\ni wont hear of such a thing commander i insist you and mister laforge stay with us\ni know that you would prefer to be alone with your very important work but if or one am glad for the company\ngood i must apologise for my husband slack of social grace she may be one of the great scientific minds in the galaxy but he does come up a bit short in other areas\nour guest quarters arent luxurious but ive tried to make this room warm and inviting\nthe environmental controls are over here\nand the door shuts by touching this panel\nthis is my sanctuary privacy is very important on a small station im left alone here often for hours\nare you still tired commander\nnoi just know he did it he killed my husband\nif you greet them with such a long face theyre going to assume something is wrong with the experiment\nim certain theyll give you the time you need if you just show a little charm\ni have all the reward i need now go on ill be right in riker\ndont be in such a hurry dear perhaps our guests would like some refreshment\noh dear no im no scientist\nbut i find this all fascinating dont you\ndarling lett ayna take care of that im sure commander riker wants to hear how close you are to a breakthrough ill pour the two of you a drink and you can talk all about krieger waves\ncommander\nits a little inconvenient\nour guest quarters are very modest\nthe station is small and we dont often have guests i use this as my sanctuary\nthe environmental controls are here\ncommander please its late and im tired\nmy husband is one of the great minds in the galaxy and we love each other very much\nplease dont\nplease my husband will be looking for me\ncommander dont please\nplease\nits exactly what happened\nplease\nyour career was safe he was a scientist in another day some fascinating bit of technical trivia would have distracted him he would have forgotten about you and his complaint to starfleet excuse me\nyes but he was very close to a breakthrough\ni have all the reward i need\nand the rewards that come with it\ni never said that\nwhats wrong with that\nridiculous\nstandby commander engaging transport\ntransporter room to engineering i have a power drain\nnot yet captain im having trouble clearing the signal\ntransporter room to bridge\nhesa board\nfor a moment we were nt sure you left the space station in time\nit just exploded sir captains log supplemental commander

guilty\ni am aware of federation regulations sir and if you investigate them further you will find the captain decides if extradition is warranted\nim saying if there is sufficient cause to warrant a trial i will release my officer into your custody\nthat question is irrelevant here\ni must protect the rights of my officer\nyou have my word as a starfleet officer that i will not\ninterrogate him here\nperhaps not mister data will you report to my ready room\nwe may be able to assist you in recreating the events\ncommander data this is chief investigator krag commander by taking testimony from the away team and from witnesses provided by the investigator would it be possible to programme the holodeck to recreate what happened on the science station\ncommander will you escort investigator krag to transporter room three\nensign crusher mister laforge we are going to recreate the research station here on the holodeck i want you to work with commander data on the preparations in addition commander laforge and commander riker i want you to give the computer detailed depositions of everything you saw everything you heard while you were on board counsellor i want you to assist me during this inquiry my decision about the extradition will be based upon the evidence presented during these recreations\nunder these circumstances number one i think that would be inappropriate second

we have nt identified the source before the time interval well leave orbit if you perceive any further danger advise me immediately\ninspector inspector this is hearsay she was nt a witness to this incident\nwell well watch this evidence and well weigh it accordingly\ni dont see any alternative do you\nof course hes innocent but as a starfleet captain i cant allow myself the luxury of yielding to my personal feelings the evidence warrants a trial ill have to allow extradition\nno\nacknowledged\nthe interval between radiation bursts\nbut why would a generator be affecting the enterprise this way\nchief inspector weve watched the events replayed over and over again and i am impressed and admittedly dismayed by the body of evidence against commander riker but isnt it remarkable that with all the witnesses all the different points of view of the events aboard the space station we havent seen what really happened\nallow me with the help of mister laforge to explain computer load manua programme one time index fourteen four one play programme\nfreeze mrs apgar this was from your deposition it would seem to suggest that your husband had failed to create krieger waves\nhe said he needed more time he was upset by our early arrival but in fact i maintain he already had made that breakthrough and that he was lying to us\nwere created your sciencelab in every conceivable detail essentially what was in the original lab is here\nyour field generator on the planet surface has been sending out harmless energy charges which this facsimile has been converting into krieger waves\nand those same waves have been randomly striking different areas of our ship as we orbit the planet and our angle to the generator changes\ncomputer run manua programme one timecode fourteen

apgar\nand when the away team arrived early he must have been worried that starfleet was becoming suspicious he needed more time to finish his work apgar said that each of the three versions no doubt he was afraid that commander riker might learn the truth and cut off his support prematurely discovering commander riker with his wife didnt help matters i submit that he decided to murder commander riker\nis it computer run tay na programme four time index eighteen one four\nfreeze\ntay na exactly is apgar doing here\nwhy would he do that\nmaybe he was already thinking ahead to his next confrontation with commander riker computer play riker programme four time index twenty four one\nfreeze to apgar this must have seemed as though commander riker were confirming his worst fears and i believe it was now that he decided finally to kill him\nweve arranged a demonstration to illustrate mister laforge i think its about time isnt it\nif were correct well know it instantly\ndoctor apgar killed himself during his attempt to kill commander riker\nnumber one have we any further business in the tan uga system\nthen perhaps you would dome the pleasure of getting this ship underway\nriker

new technology we will be altering the past\nwere talking about restoring the past\nthere are many things about her species we cant easily explained yet it is very possible she is correct a ship from the past has travelled through time how can we know what effect those events will have on the present indeed we shall never know for certain if guinan is correct but i have decided the consequences of that possibility are to ograve to ignore dismissed\ni think im aware of your opinion commander this is a briefing im not seeking your consent\neven their deaths might have prevented this war if the enterprise c returns to the battle and its mission is a success history will be irrevocably changed this timeline will cease to exist and a new future will have been created ive considered the alternatives ill go with guinan s recommendation dismissed\ni discovered long ago that she has a special wisdom ive learned to trust it i could arrange for you to speak with her if you wish\ni cant do

captain at least with someone at tactical they will have a chance to defend themselves well it may be a matter of seconds or minutes but those could be the minutes that change history guinan says i

related to each other\nwe decided the best thing to do would be to put her with younger children\nit isnt working out that way\nthe children were afraid of her\ndoctor crusher to ensign crusher arent you supposed to be getting a haircut wesley\nwell thank you data id like to think i was well please sit down how sl al\nis it lonely for her\nwhen wesley was growing up he was an extraordinarily bright boy but he had a hard time making friends i think the other children were a little intimidated by him\nwell first i went back to my own childhood and remembered how painful it was for me because i remember a time when i wasnt very popular either and when i told that to wesley it made him feel a little better he knew i understood what he was going through\nyou didnt have any one experienced to help you through sentience she at least has you just help her realise that she s not alone and be there to nurture her when she needs love and attention\nnow why do i find that so hard

lhasa positronic brain one very similar to my own i began programming it at the cybernetics conference\ntrue but here was a new submicron matrix transfer technology introduced at the conference which i discovered could be used to lay down complex neural net pathways\nexactly wesley i realised for the first time it was possible to continue doctor soon gs work my initial transfers produced very encouraging results so i brought lals brain back with me\ni have not observed anyone else on board consulting you about their procreation captain\ni decided to allow my child to choose its own sex and appearance\ni am sorry captain i did not anticipate your objections do you wish me to deactivate lal\ni have followed all of starfleet regulations to the best of my ability i expected they would be pleased\nto prepare i have scanned all available literature on parenting there seems to be much confusion on this issue one traditional doctrine insists spare the rod and spoil the child suggesting a punitive approach while another more liberal attitude would allow the child enormous freedom\nand what klingons do to their children\ndoes that not describe becoming a parent sir\nthat is why i must attempt this siri have observed that in most species there is a primal instinct to perpetuate themselves until now i have been the last of my kind if i were to be damaged or destroyed i would be lost forever but if i am successful with the creation of lal my continuance is assured i understand the risks iran diam prepared to accept the responsibility\ncorrect\nthat is why you must choose a gender lal to complete your appearance\naccess your databank on sexuality level two that will define the parameters\nno lal that would be confusing we are taking you to the holodeck to show you several thousand composites i have programmed you may choose from them\nthis is a big decision\ncounsellor lal has narrowed the choices to four would you like to see\ncomputer lal gender sequence finalists begin an andorian female\nthat could make socialisation more difficult a human male\na human female\na klingon male\ni have completed the assembly of the replicated anatomy i was able to provide lal with more realistic skin and eyecolour than my own\nthis is home lal\nyes we are a family lal chair to sit in sit good painting\nyes i will teach you to recognise the artistry in paintings\nyes very good lal you have correctly processed the sense of touch there are many fascinating experiences i wish to share with you\nno that is a flower lal inhale\nyes\nthe transfer itself is fairly simple each neural pathway in my brain is duplicated precisely in hers theoretically the duplicate brains should be able to store and process the same information but until all of the transfers are complete we will not know for certain\nshe studies in our quarters she requires very little supervision lal is quite self sufficient\nshe already has access to the sum of human knowledge from me\nshe is only two weeks old\nlal the third crosslink transfer series is complete\npurpose\nthat is a complex question lali can only begin to answer by telling you that our function is to contribute in a positive way to the world in which we live\nbecause you are my child\nthese questions suggest that we have made a successful transfer of the heuristic associative pathways you will now begin to process information on logic aesthetics metaphysics and epistemology you are truly becoming sentient lal\nby developing the awareness to examine and question your perceptions\ntomorrow will be your first day of school lal\na perfect score\ni see\nthat would seem to be reasonable\nit is a human physiological response to humour\ndeck fifteen lal\nthe children were not laughing with you they were laughing at you\none

successful parent\nlal is realising she is not the same as other children\nshe does not feel the emotion of loneliness but she can observe how isolated she is from the others she wishes to be more like them i do not know how to help her lal is passing into sentience it is perhaps the most difficult stage of her development\nthat is precisely what happened to lal in school how did you help him\ni have not told lal how difficult it was for me to assimilate i did not wish it to discourage her perhaps this was an error of judgement\ni can give her attention doctor but i am incapable of giving her love\nguinan\nguinan lal needs to observe human behaviour\nand for this opportunity she is willing to provide services to assist you\nthat would be most beneficial\nyou have used a verbal contraction\nit is a skill my programme has never mastered\nno you have exceeded my abilities i do not object but i do not understand how this has occurred\naye sir\ni am certain the admiral is anxious to meet lali have been sending him regular status reports on her development\nher environment sir\nthen he wishes to relocate us\ni would not be in favour of that sir there are many things that she can learn only from me my lifetime of experiences the mistakes i have made and what i have learned from them\nthen he is questioning my ability as a parent\ndoes the admiral have children\ni am forced to wonder how much experience he had as a parent when his first child was born\ncommander what are your intentions toward my daughter\nit is a limitation we must learn to accept lal\ni have asked myself that many times as i have struggled to be more human until i realised it is the struggle itself that is most important we must strive to be more than we are lalit does not matter that we will never reach our ultimate goal the effort yields its own rewards\nit is the difference between knowledge and experience\nsolal now possesses the sum of my programming\nthere do seem to be some variations on the quantum level she can use contractions i can not\ni have maintained records on positronic matrix activity behavioral norms and all verbal patterns i have seen no evidence of other aberrations\nis that not the goal of every parent sir\ni am programmed with the procedures you mention sir and in any meaningful evaluation of lal you would require a model for a basis of comparison i am the only model available admiral\nno sir\nit is an opportunity for her to observe human behaviour and more importantly for her to interact with her crewmates\nmay i ask why sir\nadmiral when i created lalit was in the hope that someday she would choose to enter the academy and become a member of starfleet i wanted to give something back in return for all starfleet has given me i still do but lal is my child you ask that i volunteer to give her upi can not it would violate every lesson i have learned about human parenting i have brought a new life into this world and it is my duty not star fleets to guide her through these first difficult steps to maturity to support her as she learns to prepare her to be a contributing member of society no one can relieve me from that obligation and i can not ignore it iam her father\nlal is programmed to return to the lab in the event of a malfunction\nyes la liam here\nit appears to be a symptom of cascade failure it would require initialisation the base matrix without wiping out the higher functions\nthank you admiral\nlali am unable to correct the system failure\nwe must say goodbye now\nwhat do you feel lal\ni wish i could feel it with you\nlal suffered complete neural system failure at thirteen hundred hours i have deactivated the unit\ni thankyou for your sympathy but she is here her presence so enriched my life that i could not allow her to pass into oblivion so i incorporated her programs back into my own i have transferred her memories to me\nhello data\nlal how are you\ngood\nshes in the right place for

that sd one might be irreparable\ncaptain are we talking about breaking up a family isnt that rather a sentimental attitude about androids\nyes captain and i am more than willing to acknowledge that what you must acknowledge is that lal may be a technological step forward in the development of artificial intelligence\nyes and work like this demands to be done with controlled procedures\nineffective isolation and that is what starfleet research finds unacceptable\nher neural nets are laid down identically to yours\nan aberration what have you done about this\nbut as a good father dont you think it would be better especially in light of this new aberration if lal were close to people trained in diagnostic and evaluative procedures\nyou havent mastered human cultural and behavioural norms yourself yet have you\nwhere is lal now\nthis is your idea of appropriate guidance\nshe is capable of running over sixty trillion calculations per second and you have her working as a cocktail waitress\nim not convinced the sort of behaviour she observes here will be a positive influence\ni want the android out of here\nhave her report to me immediately for an interview\nwell la live been looking forward to meeting you\nyour every important to us at starfleet research we have got quite a facility at gal or four i want like to show it to you\nohno of course not we just want to broaden your experience theres only so much you can learn on a starship im sure youll agree to that\ngood\nthat is not the natural conclusion here\nyes dont misunderstand mei have great respect for your father\nshe seems very adversarial\ni dont think your father has taught you selective judgment in the verbal is a tion of your own thoughts that is a skill we will help you develop\nthe question is has he helped you enough\nno i didnt mean to ask any\nyou have lal off to a wonderful start in life commander and thats what being a parent is all about however i have finally decided that i must ask you to release her to me\nall the other arguments aside theres one that is irrefutable there are only two soong type androids in existence it would be very dangerous to have you both in the same place especially aboard a starship one lucky shot by a romulan wed lose you both\nyour e not a parent captain i am i have learned with difficulty that there comes a time when all parents must give up their children for their own good\nmister data it would be better for lal if she left knowing you had voluntarily decided that this was the best course of action\nthen i regret that i must order you to transport la la board my ship\ni beg your pardon\ni am starfleet captain proceed commander\ncaptain you are jeopardising your command and your career\ni agree may i assist\nif you ll excuse us commander data and i have much to do\nshe wont survive much longer there was nothing anyone could have done wed re polarise one pathway and another would collapse and then another his hands were moving faster than i could see trying to stay ahead of each breakdown he refused to give up he was remarkable it just wasnt meant to be\nhe sent for you too\nsomething happened at that cybernetics conference since he s come back hes spent every off duty minute in that lab\nnow how would you know that ahha\nbut nobody s ever been able to do that data at least not since you were programmed\nhello

motor coordination has improved twelve percent reflexes still need to develop visual comprehension is especially difficult for lal translating her vast databanks into recognisable applications may improve with additional transfers she is also learning to supplement her innate android behaviour with simulated human responses and it is interesting to note that as i observe lal learning about her world i share in her experience almost as though i am learning things over again\nfather what is my purpose\nmy function my reason for being\nwhy a mime instead of someone else\nwhere did i come from\nhow\nwhy do we have two hands why not three or four why is the sky black why do\nfather what is the significance of laughter\nthen judging from their laughter the children at school found my

romulan ship had learned of the treachery but only the council knew whose security code had been transmitted jarod father of duras\nhis family is powerful if the truth were known it would shatter the council most certainly plunge us into civil war you were in starfleet we did not expect you to challenge the judgment nor did we know there was another son of mo gh\nyou do not understand his challenge was defeated before he ever made it you will not be allowed to present this evidence the judgment stands you will be condemned so will your brother there is no other way now\nthe empire will not be destroyed for one family s honour\nthis is not the federation picard if you defy an order of the high council the alliance with the federation could fall to dust\nit would be the same as

kurn commander rank klingon defence force you will address me as commander or sir at all times i am fully aware of all starfleet regulations and they will be strictly adhered to by all personnel while i am in command it is my intention to bring a sense of discipline that you may not be accustomed to with your permission of course captain\ni have studied all of your service records impressive we shall see if you live up to your reputations do you wish to speak acting ensign wesley crusher\nthe crew awaits your orders captain\nset course one one four mark two three zero one third impulse power\nexecute\ncan you identify the coordinates mister worf\nexcellent please scan the asteroid field for me lieutenant and report\nso no course correction is necessary is that what you are saying\nvery good lieutenant you handled that well\nyes\nyes\na suggestion\nno commander it wouldnt\nno commander it is not if it were a klingon ship i would have killed you for offering your suggestion\nhow long has the bird been dead it appears to have been lying in the sun for quite some time\nah yes i was told to prepare for that is hall try some of your burned replicated bird meat\nthe odour is not palatable what is it\ni am honoured captain\ni find the constraints a bit difficult to conform to just a short while ago i had to stop myself from killing commander riker i believe he was trying to communicate the crews sense of discomfort with my style of command under different circumstances i would consider that a challenge to my authority\nnone taken in ever kill anyone at the supper table mister laforge\nour food has much more taste to it while im sure this is well prepared it is far too bland for the stomach of a klingon\nyes\nenter\nel\nfor what purpose\nare your quarters so comfortable\nthis entire ship seems built on comfort relaxation being at ease it is not the ship of a warrior not the ship of a klingon you can not ask these questions within the boundaries of protocol\npermission granted pose your questions\ni am not human if you had given offence you would not need to ask\ni find you to be a capable starfleet officer a credit to your ship\nhave ii did not know that being polite to a starfleet officer would bring dishonour on him\nreally perhaps your blood has thinned in this environment i simply dont want to hurt you\nmev yap so your blood is not so thin after all\nthat is the response of a klingon the response i would expect from my older brother\ni was barely a year old when you left for the khi tomer outpost you our mother and father were not going to stay long it was decided that i did not need to go i was left to stay with our fathers friend lorg h until you returned you never did\nthey assumed that i was killed with the family atkhitomerlorghhadnoson she took me into his family it was not until i had reached the age of ascension that i was told the truth\nit was an excellent opportunity to see what kind of klingon you were or if you were klingon at all\nit should but it was required\nno much more you are the eldest son the challenge is yours to make\nthe klingon high council has judged our father a traitor to the empire\nsir\nwe arrive within the hour\nthe council will receive you at high sun in the great hall of\nyoull need a chad ich to defend you while you are accused you will not be allowed combat i would be honoured if you chose me\nj ilajnesghijqetjaghmeyjaj the two sons of mo gh together we will restore the family honour\ni must\nbecause it would mean my death as well if you fail a klingons honour means more to him than his life perhaps your human values have clouded your judgment i insist\nyes brother\niamkurnsonoflorghi will stand by worf s side i am chad ich\ni should have known worf was right it is a good day to die\nwhat\nwe will see\nhe is my brother i will not betray him\nwhy is he doing this i was prepared to die\nbut to do this\nyes sir its our new first officer\njust the entire section he pulled a surprise inspection in the middle of a maintenance cycle i tried to explain it to him\nwere all going to be doing double shifts down there just to ready for the next inspection\nyeah but this isnt a klingon vessel hes going to have to loosen up commander\nexcept the one guy who wouldnt really mind it\nits not dead its been replicated you do understand that we cook most of our foods\nand then some no offence sir\nit seems to agree with worf\nfrom worf s father\nwe can cross check them against the intrepids sensor logs\nlooks like a pretty good match up data\nthose are gaps in the intrepids logs missing information due to the range\nwait a second data backup just before the intrepids gap begins the time base of both files are in perfect sync but look look at what happens to the signal after the shields are dropped\ncommander somebodys been rewriting history\nwe must take care that while he is with us commander kurn is accorded all the rights and responsibilities due the first officer of this ship if he should feel patronised in any way\nyour experience onboard the pa gh will prove invaluable during the commanders tour be sure that the crew is prepared for any unusual orders\ni understand that he requested the enterprise specifically\nenergise\nwelcome aboard the enterprise commander im captain picard this is commander william riker he will be yielding the first officers position to you during your tour\nvery well if you will accompany us to the bridge\noh by all means commander\nthen take us to the outer cometary cloud commander\ni have attempted to select a menu that will allow you to sample a variety of dishes commander\nlater data a fish commander a delicacy from the caspian sea on earth its a favourite of mine our replicators never done it justice but i managed to store a few cases for special occasions\none of the aims of the exchange programme commander is for all of us to learn tolerance as for my crew it may be healthy to shake up the status quo occasionally\nwhat are the allegations worf\nthe attack in which he himself was killed but why now after twenty years\nanswer for them\nno if i understand correctly a starfleet officer a respected member of my crew could be accused of a capital crime your actions in this matter will reflect on this ship and on the federation therefore it seems only appropriate that your captain should be at your side while you make your challenge im sure you would do no less for me\ncommander kurn\nwere changing course set coordinates for the first city of the klingon imperial empire\ni am here at my own request i am captain jean luc picard of the enterprise\nlieutenant worf has served under my command with distinction he has earned my admiration and my

like to make one suggestions ir\nwhen i served aboard the pa gh the hardest part for me was recognising and adapting to the demands of the crew they needed an iron hand i imagine it must be very difficult for you to work with a crew that is so different i would be happy to guide you in that regard if it would be helpful\nthis is not a klingon ship sir\nthe commander certainly appears to have

trust one another we have no hope of escape\nand what if there is mister t holl shall we continue accusing one another until hostility leads to violence shall we allow our suspicions to destroy us now lets see if we can override this stun mechanism 2\nhelm take us into twenty million kilometres\nnoted mister data\nyou have the bridge mister data\nim under no obligation to tell you that\non what grounds\nno reason your e aware of\nerratic enough to justify mutiny do you honestly believe you have sufficient evidence to convince a board of inquiry\nnumber one has it occurred to you that you

has gone far enough dont you\noh yes you do this isnt a holding cell its a laboratory maze a carefully structured test its an experiment to see how well were act under pressure\nits the only explanation look at the four of us we do have something in common we all react differently to authority you the collaborator defer to whoever has control you the anarchist reject authority in any form i a starfleet captain trained to command and you a starfleet cadet sworn to obey a superior officers authority our captors have placed us here and have devised obstacles for us to overcome they give us food which eso qq cant eat to make him a threat they give us a door we cant open until the four of us cooperate and each time we succeed they deal us reverses to set us against each other again while you observe our reactions\ni found it unlikely that a first year cadet would know of the enterprises visit to mint aka three so i tested you starfleet has classified the cor caroli five plague as secret no cadet would have knowledge of that incident\nso you may as well drop this pretence im not playing any further im quitting the game as far as i am concerned this experiment is over\nan impostor running myship2\nhold your positions take no action\nwhy did you choose to study the concepts of authority and leadership 4\nyou have no right to put us through this just to satisfy your

up\nthats odd we were nt notified of a rendezvous\non screen\nrobert why didnt you inform us\nso old friend how are you\nbut not today\nif time is so important why didnt they transmit the orders by subspace\nwhat sort of passenger\nmister data come with me\nyou know him\nohi see he was a colleague of yours\nwelcome aboard the enterprise im\ndata\nnumber one\nwill you meet commander data on the bridge he has our orders and new heading\nand assemble the bridge staff for a mission briefing in fifteen minutes picard out mister el brun would you\nalive how\nromulans\nthey claim that sector of space where beta stromgren is located\nthen they will certainly be sending a ship of their own to investigate this tinman\nthen its a race an alien intelligence a new life form representing a technology far beyond that of either the romulans or ourselves the romulans will certainly take whatever measures are required to secure this creature for study\nmister data you are our resident honour student in exobiology im assigning you to head up the life sciences on this mission\nmeeting adjourned then\nmister el brun one of the reasons im asking you to work closely with a member of my staff is to avoid any further omissions the possibility of an encounter with romulans on this mission is hardly trivial and yet\na prodigy in what sense\nyou mean your e not born reading minds\nhow different\nyou mentioned a hospitalisation\nyes well hes evidently done more than hold together hes the indispensable man the federations finest specialist in communication with unknown life forms\nstatus report number one\ngrand\non screen\nmagnify\nremarkable computer locate tame lb run\nof course\nyellow alert on screen\ngoto red alert shields to maximum\nevasive mister crusher hailing frequencies\ndamage report\nincidental\none way trip\nyou read all this telepathically\nvery well mister crusher all stop\ncommander laforge\ngeordi picard\ngo ahead\nyou have ten picard out\nif the romulans wish the honour of the first contact let them have it\ni think the chances of that is remote and if you will be still mister el brun you may learn\nthat being first at any cost is not always the point mister data while we await repairs i want life sciences and engineering to continue collecting information on the alien and query the vega nine probe long range sensors\nyellow alert prepare for evasive action at the first change in the romulans course\nwhat do you mean do they intend to destroy it\nincrease speed to intercept the romulan vessel\nhail them we can not allow them\ndamage report\nit seems you woke your tinman\ngood because i want to know exactly what you did i want to know how closely you are in communication with the alien and what youve learned about it and i want to know now\nwhere did it come from how many\nonce\nperhaps we can help it in some way can you ask it to return with us to federation space at least persuade it to leave the vicinity of beta stromgren before the star explodes\nno that is absolutely out of the question\nnot am i dont believe that idot am when you reached out to the alien to warn it did you give any thought to this vessel to the danger however inadvertent that creature might pose to our crew or did you simply react out of instinct\ndata you seem to have developed an affinity with el brunt roi youve known him for years how far can he be trusted\nyes of course but his judgment\nafraid of what\nthank you both\ndata\ntame lb run warned tinman the first thing it did was to destroy a space vessel\ncounselor troi understands him better\nstatus number one\nwell lets hope they reina mood to talk hailing frequency\nromulan vessel this is captain jean luc picard of the uss enterprise\nwe are not familiar with the terms of your claim on this sector were here engaged in scientific research do you wish to participate\npicard to tame lb run\nreport to transporter room six immediately\ncommander data will meet you there\ncounsellor we no longer have a choice\ngo ahead chief\nfollow them in mister crusher red alert mister wor farm photon torpedoes\ncommander we are prepared to defend the life of the alien screen off shields up\nits beginning\nthe romulans know that as well as we do\nconn report\ndata\ndata what happened over there\nthey seem to be in an awful hurry\nas in tame lb run of the ghor usda disaster\nriker here\naye sir\nforty seven including the captain of the adelphi and two friends from my class at the academy\nmain bridge\nit was a first contact situation g horus dan culture is so complex and different that the federation sent a specialist to prevent misunderstanding\nnot directly board of inquiry blamed d arson for carelessness about g horus dan cultural taboos but if el brun was so good why didn the war nd arson what was he doing there if he couldnt sense that much hostility\nthats twenty three parsecs beyond our furthest manned explorations\nhave attempts been made\nweve reached the outer regions of the beta stromgren system on course for orbital intercept of tinman eighteen minutes\nnot altogether astrophysics reports that the stars rate of collapse has increased it could go supernova in the next few days\narm photon torpedoes and standby mister worf\ni thought you said the enterprise was faster than this romulan\nso they kept up with us by sacrificing their ability to reenter romulan space\nresponse\nbut your e so sure itll talk to you\nwith our shields in their present condition we cant\nhow long\nall of it\nwe dont know that we have twenty hours that star could explode at any moment\nno we fix the shields first\nim not worried about tinman its more romulans showing up\ndont ask me about surprises ask tame lb run\nriker to laforge how sit coming\ndo it\nriker here\nworf\ngeordi are we going to have those shields anytime soon\nshields are at forty percent we can manoeuvre on impulse sir\nthat stars going to go any minute sir\nenterprise your presence here is a violation of romulan space you will leave immediately\nwe have monitored the destruction of our sister ship by the star creature we claim right of vengeance we will destroy the alien if you interfere we will destroy you as well captains log supplemental a confrontation between the romulan warbird and tinman is imminent i have no alternative but to rely on the telepathic abilities of tame lb run\ncaptain picard if you interfere with us we will fire upon you as well\ncaptain picard right here you want to know all about your mission everything son there orders and briefings destination and heading all that dee i sensed you were out here how ve you been\nyou were on thought you were on chandra five\nwho what are you\nincredible an android i cant read you at all its like your e not there\noh you better hurry up to the bridge with that captain wants you to run the orders scan the technical schematics and be ready to brief him in ten minutes right\ncare to see my quarters no id rather get this briefing over with then be left alone until im needed\noh data dont waste time they call it tinman the vega pro be found it orbiting stromgren\nits energy source is unknown the people who ve studied the transmissions think its a starship and theyre sure its alive\nno no no here starfleet believes it san organic creature born in space living its life in the wastes between stars no one knows where it came from or why its here but were going to meet it were going to talk to it im going to talk to it\nto communicate with it by subspace of course lingua code universal translation all that it wont work tinman is too different direct mind to mind contact is our only hope\nhell i forgot the romulans\nno actually they resending two data\nexcellent\nso data i guess your e the brains of this outfit huh\nall right all right i should have brought up the romulans earlier but i was distracted and no billy boy i wasnt distracted on ghor usda if dar son had listened to me no one would have died no well i dont care whether you believe that or not captains log supplemental travelling at high warp we are still several days from rendezvous with the mysterious entity which starfleet has christened tinman my immediate concern is with tame lb run starfleet considers his unique abilities crucial to our mission yet he seems to me unstable\ncome in\nhow re things in the land of the living\nlonely i can hear everything that everyone on this ship thinks no one besides you seems to be missing my charming\nbecause im not a nice man okay okay because they scare me theyre too many minds i cant shut them out in ever could learn all their loves their hates their fears their needs its like a tide that never ebbs i could drown\nyou understood at least a little how i felt i see you finally found a place to fit in people to care about\nthen there sgh or usda ive got enough doubt in my reliability without having to listen to rikers and pi cards\ni thought everyone knew\nmay be i got too involved with the ghor us dans with their point of view it happens to me i wanted everyone to get along i could have warned d arson more forcefully\nbeautiful creatures the chandran s their minds are glacial they have a lovely three day ritual for saying hello peaceful untroubled people\nwell except for your friend data i like him he s restful\nyeah well having to get to know someone just once has its appeal i mean talking to them instead of getting it all at once up here whether i want it or not\nhow could i not think of it dee this intelligence that swims naked through space like a fish in the sea totally alien mysterious not like us at all ancient and alone so lonely for so long\nno well yes a little but not quite on a conscious level\nimpossible for me maybe not impossible for tinman\ni guarantee that they dont want to talk to you captain\ntheir attack onus was incidental captain\nyes to delay us\nthere is one more trailing us captain a day or two behind data s right this ones job is to beat us to tinman at any cost\nin the mind of the romulan commander during the attack\nyour e out of your mind picard what if the romulans find a way to persuade tinman to\nwhat\nyou do a lot of your work here\nnice a little spartan\nlots of workspace not much room to live i dont guess you sleep\nbut you paint\nin what way\nwhy must living beings have a purpose or do we exist for no reason but to exist\nah data your e uniquely qualified you think a great deal about humanity and your e an honest researcher you dont treat anything as trivial or irrelevant you want to try it all\ntrue enough but i think i understand you pretty well it worries you that i cant read your mind\nperhaps your e just different not asin you know though you may have heard otherwise\nwhy should it answer what could it possibly have in common with them\nno no were not the target its tinman\nthose are their orders if they cant secure the alien\nthey wont listen to you\ndanger go mtu u do not allow\nbut im going to live\ni just warned it thats all ive been in contact with it sensing impressions from it it calls itself go mtu u its old captain its roamed the universe for many thousands of years\nfar away may be beyond the galaxy once there were millions of them\nit has nt seen another of its kind for millennia its alone it may be the last of its species\ncaptain go mtu u knows that the star will go nova soon thats why its here it wants to die there was an explosion in space radiation penetrating the outer layers the crew oh the crew died such loss empty pain hollowness\ni know i know tinman hurts and wants to die i cant do any more from out here if you want me to really reach tinman i have got to be in physical contact i have got to go aboard\nyou dont trust me\ndeanna hes right i dont know i dont know what might happen but if you dont let me go we fail our mission besides at this point you need all the help you can get event in mans\ncaptain\nyes captain\nno no too much too much\ni cant\nno dont\nits all right its all right now go mtu u was trying to communicate a lifetime of experiences to me in a few seconds but im all right now\nyes\ni know i know everything now come on\nthis is the control centre where go mtu us crew guided their journeys the ship and the crew existed symbiotically they needed one another when go mtu u had no one left to care for it no longer had a reason to exist\nit is for me deanna was right ill lose myself here\nim not going back data im staying here\nexplain to them make them understand\nis to save tinman and iwill but he s going to save me as well all my life i have waited for this a chance to find peace finally all the voices are silent only tinman speaks to me now dont you see data this is where i belong\ncaptain let me come with you to greet tam\ni do he was at the university on beta zed when i studied psychology there\nno he was a patient\ntam is a telepath of extraordinary talent even for a beta zoid hes a specialist in first contact with new life forms\nhes a very unique person but he s not what you might expect captain\nive been fine but i thought\nyou were on thought you were on chandra five\nthe opportunity for discovery is extraordinary but i dont understand starfleet s urgency\nwell in most beta zoids our telepathic gifts develop at adolescence\nno except for some reason that no one understands occasionally a beta zoid child is born different\nmost beta zoids born like that never lead a normal life\nand painful early diagnosis and special training did help tam adjust but he has some problems\nfor stress repeatedly throughout his life\ni thought you might be lonely no one sees you except data\nyou want them to dislike you why\ni remember\nand your e still looking\nwhat happened there\nno what happened to you\nso after that you ran away the last i heard you were the only federation delegate assigned to chandra five\nunlike humanoids\ni believe your impression of data is probably unique\nbut you accepted this mission you could have stayed on chandra five you willingly came aboard a ship with over a thousand people\nhow can you know that tam your ein contact with it with tinman arent you\nwere light years away thats impossible even for you\ntam stop this your e losing yourself in this this merging\ncaptain\ncaptain the issue isnt one of trust in tams intentions but in his judgment i would trust him to do what he believes is right\nis precarious the stress of exposure to so many minds on the ship is bad enough now hes strongly drawn to this creature im afraid for him\ni sense that the alien is somehow calling him if we allow him to do as he insists to be a move rim believe that we will lose him to it that he will lose himself\ncaptain if tam breaks down over there well be no closer to accomplishing our mission it would be a grave mistake\ncaptain i dont\ntam\nyou sent for me\nwhat did happen\nwounded isolated\ndata you do understand\nthats odd we were nt notified of a rendezvous\ncommander data im picking up an unusual echo from my navigational sensors\nbut commander if it is a romulan ship with their cloaking device we shouldnt pick them up at all\nlike what\naye sir\ntheir lead is too great sir\ncaptain the diameter of the star has decreased by one hundred

with us this week as part of his training duties so ill be assigning him to assist you mister myers be sure and teach him the difference between impulse and warp drive please lieutenant barclay has working on the mystery of the anti grav failure we had yesterday your preliminary report had a couple of interesting theories reg why dont you bring us all up to speed on your findings so far\nbut we shouldnt ignore the possibilities wes\ngood okay then lets go over the realignment procedure gentlemen\nits not that you did anything wrong we sits just that barclays well hes my new project\ni just need to draw him out some more\ndata s absolutely right the nickname stops here and now captains orders\na problem with the replicator\ni cant detect any residual radiation or unusual chemical

wouldnt bother you with something this minor commander but it may be a symptom of a more serious problem\nwell have a better idea after mister barclay runs a check on the power systems\nfigures\ni dont know im just trying to figure the man out do you ever talk to him\ndoes he have any friends\nwhat do you do with a guy like that\nyeah well im not so lucky i cant let him be hes my problem\nhow do you know that\nwell then maybe he sin the wrong line of work\nthats not it guinan he just doesnt fit in here\nwhat\ndid you\nmay be im not make myself clear guinan barclay well hes always late the

doesnt interfere with your work\ni dont think everybody would appreciate your imagination like i do it is kind of unusual recreating people you already know\nlet me guess\ni dont know theresa part of

barclay report to the bridge lieutenant barclay report\nill get him\ncounsellor you d better come along\ni think you should know barclays been running some unique programs\nlike i said commander barclays been running some unusual programs\ncommander i dont think theres any regulation against\njust tell us where to find barclay\nohmygod\ngo ahead captain\nwell im not in engineering siri min holodeck two\nnot exactly but ill return to engineering immediately sir\nyes sir\nid like to very much captain laforge out we need to find barclay now\ncommander barclay and i had better get to engineering\nreg you had a chance to get some help from the real counsellor troi but instead you went back in there\nyour e going to be able to write the book on holo diction look i know how easy it is to get caught up initi fell in love in there once\nbut i knew when it was time to turn it off and say goodbye it wasnt easy but i did it\ni need you out here regnow more than ever\nthe injectors arent responding to the diagnostic commands\nlaforge to bridge\nrecommend we go to impulse power captain\noverride\nwe cant shut it down captain antimatter flow is increasing shes accelerating out of

reg\ndamnit\nobrien to laforge\ni need you in transporter room three commander\ni was synchronising the phase transition coils i didnt do anything i havent done a hundred times before the test object is made of pure d uranium\nwatch this\naye sir\nim not accustomed to seeing an unsatisfactory rating for one of my crew\ni assume from your request for his transfer that you think he s not commander\nbroccoli\nlets just get that uncaught shall we theres every indication hes served competently in starfleet for years his ratings aboard the zhukov were satisfactory in fact i recall captain gleason speaking quite highly of him before his transfer\nand yet he chose this way of life he has made the same commitment to starfleet that we all have its easy to transfer a problem to someone else too easy\ntry harder geordi hes a member of your team try to find some way to help him to make a positive contribution get to know the man better make him your best friend\nthen i suggest you put your personal discomfort on one side commander dismissed\nwill your investigation affect our available power during the mission\ngood i look forward to your report mister broccoli barclay\nin gods name where did you learn to fight like this man\nwho is that one of your allies\nis this part of the same pattern\nwe reach nahm i four in twenty two hours well want all transporters operational by then i

enterprise we set a different standard here understood\ni guess the issue is whether mister barclay is enterprise material\nyoung mister crusher started that i guess its caught on\nin retrospect i wonder if captain gleason wasnt buttering our bread a little he knew we were looking for a diagnostic engineer ive examined barclays psychological profile hesa history of se clusive tendencies it was noted at the academy more than once\ndo you think well need to put into a starbase\nyet\nadvise mister barclay to join us on the bridge immediately\nfourteen hundred hours mister obrien no maintenance

it is imperative that he be allowed to conserve his strength i must request that you dispense with any formal activities normally associated with a visitor of his rank\nim afraid it would be

sarek s supposed condition and perrin how could his wife function normally if this theory of yours is correct\nyou are accusing the greatest man of his time of losing his mind on the eve of his greatest triumph and you can not explain why i wont report this to the ambassador for the moment i dont want to divert his attention from the mission but if i were you in the interests of your career

husband has taken an interest in your career he finds it to be satisfactory\nsome people who expect an emotional response often find vulcans quite cold when they are merely being\nexactly\nwhat a tempting offer i doubt that the ambassador will be able to attend but i will make it a point to ask him\nas doi\nyou are still unable to meditate\nit has eluded you for many weeks\nyou know i am right\nta taglia would be lovely\ni look forward to it\ncaptain i dont think i understand what your e telling me my husband is responsible for your crew assaulting one another\nbend ii syndrome is more a folktale than a disease there hasnt been a true case of it in my husbands lifetime\nsakka th sakka th knows nothing my husband didnt teach him\nthat is not true\ncaptain i know a good deal about the vulcan mind and i know a good deal about the heart of one particular vulcan i am his wife and he is fine he does not have bend ii syndrome and that shall be the end of it\nplease you must not do this to him\nsarek i see no reason to continue this discussion\nsarek i ask you to reconsider\ni must speak with you captain\nrest in give come to ask you to reconsider your position\nsarek is a good man hes given the federation a lifetime of service i beg you to let him keep the respect he has earned\nmend rossen and in ever wanted to deceive you my husbands condition came on him so gradually it was so easy to delude ourselves and pretend that nothing was wrong we convinced ourselves that he could complete this one last task and end his career with dignity help him captain help him regain his pride his honour\nthe mission can be saved but he needs your help to do it\nthank you captain\ni know i have always known\ni met him once many years ago very briefly at his sons wedding i can tell you that was quite a moment for a young lieutenant standing in the presence of such history i remember he spoke to me and i just stood there grinning like an idiot\nindeed how do you make small talk with someone who shaped the federation\nunofficially thats what i hear what a crowning achievement for his career the benefits of relations with the lega rans are incalculable\nhas the ambassador been delayed\nplease go ahead\ni believe the ambassador is extremely fond of mozart\nyou have my assurance that the ambassador will not be disturbed during the voyage\nwelcome aboard the enterprise ambassadors are k\nyour service honours us\nmrs sarek\nthis is my first officer commander william riker\nno ambassador commander laforge and ensign crusher are\ni assure you ambassador everything will be ready before the conference begins\ni hope im that frail when im two hundred and two years old but his aides did seem to be a little over protective didnt they\nwell well respect mister men dros sens request and allow ambassadors are k his privacy i suppose they were foolish and vain my expectations of this voyage sharing his thoughts memories his unique understanding of the history hes made\nnot he concert will ahead as scheduled but its a pity that the guest of honour will be absent\nthats an excellent idea counsellor you have the bridge number one\ni hope im not intruding\nactually i came to see you\ni find that hard to believe thank you\nthe honour is ours\nmy word high praise from a vulcan\nlogical\ni came to invite you and your husband if he is available to a mozart recital this evening\nwell then i hope to see you tonight\ni noticed that lieutenant worf put ensign damato on report for insubordination\nindeed he has would you look into it number one\ngood evening\ni assume the work is progressing on the conference room\nambassadors are k perrin on behalf of the entire crew welcome\ncommander data will be our featured soloist this evening\nat your convenience mister data please\nare you suggesting this is somehow contagious\nthis is a hell of a time whatever it is i dont want it to affect the ambassador i want his quarters isolated from the rest of the crew until weve identified the cause\nsarek\nhe cried i saw that i couldnt believe it a vulcan moved to tears by music its\nwhat would cause such a loss of control\ni can imagine nothing that would be more offensive to a vulcan their emotional detachment is the very core of their being how would this affect others onboard the ship\nand when the leg a rans beam on board\nis there a treatment\nsarek has built a personal relationship with them they will accept no one else how can we confirm your diagnosis\ni have twelve hours\nnevertheless we appear to be facing\nmister mend rossen\ni can not explain that hundreds of others on board have not been affected either i have not it appears to be random proximity apparently has no bearing on the phenomenon\nmister data will you please report to my ready room\nits ironic isnt it all this magnificent technology and we find ourselves still susceptible to the ravages of old age the loss of dignity the slow betrayal of our bodies by forces we can not master do you still want to be one of us data\nlogic fails us sometimes data i think this is one of those times i can only guess that he does not see or he does not wish to see the truth and he is being insulated against that truth by those who love him most\nnot a task that im looking forward to\nwhat would you have me do march down there and destroy the man\ni know that\ndont you tell me what to do\nof course your e right number one its a task that i will attend to\nhe is very ill perrin\ntheres one now sakka th knows\nhe knows and more than that on this mission he has been consciously holdings are ks mind together as well as he could\ni must see sarek\nim sorry\nthe loss is mine ambassador\nunfortunately the results would not be available for several days which is why i must ask for a postponement of the conference\nthen why must sakka th help to contain your emotions\ni hope ive not embarrassed you ambassador\ni think you are affected sir far more than you realise\nthere is an epidemic of violent incidents aboard the enterprise as we speak the situation is worsening\nyes my chief medical officer has explored all other probable cause s\nthat is correct\nshe is it is also a fact that these incidents began shortly after your arrival\nis it also coincidence that your wife and chief of staff are carefully isolating you\nsurely sakka th can not be influenced by emotion\nbut you needed his help at the concert or is there possibly some other logical explanation for what happened that night\ni saw you crying\ni was there i saw the tears\nso you were emotionally affected by the music\nyou still havent answered my questions are k is it logical for a vulcan to cry\nno other logical solutions but ambassador there are always other solutions you have said so yourself many times\nsarek of vulcan would never be afraid of looking straight at something he did not want to see\nsarek of vulcan never confused what he wanted with the truth\ndo i hear anger in your voice\nnoi will present our regrets to the leg a rans personally it is vital that they understand our reasons for cancelling these negotiations\nbut at what cost number one\ncome perrin\nhow is the ambassador\nyou know that is impossible\nhell never lose that respect\nbelieve me it would give me great pleasure but there is nothing i can do\nyes i do ambassador but i also realise the potential benefits\nwhich for a few hours should provide the emotional control you need in that time you can meet with the leg a rans and conclude the treaty\nim aware of the risks but it is the only logical solution\ni didnt expect that you would beverly\nim afraid not though i do admit to a certain trepidation your company is much appreciated\ncome\ndoctor crusher will monitor our responses\nno it is wrong it is wrong a lifetime of discipline washed away and in its place bedlam bedlam i am so old there is nothing left but dry bones and dead friends tired oh so tired\nno this weakness disgusts me i hate it where is my logic i am betrayed by desires i want to feel i want to feel everything but i am a vulcan i must feel nothing give me back my control\nperrin amanda i wanted to give you so much more i wanted to show you such tenderness but that is not our way spock amanda did you know perrin can you know how much iloveyou i do love you\nbeverly\nits quite difficult the anguish of the man the despair pouring out of him all those feelings the regrets i cant stop them\ni cant stop them i cant i cant\ni hope your journey aboard the merrimac will be uneventful\nhe loves you very much\ni hope you are wrong ambassador\ni believe i have the best part of that bargain ambassador peace and long life\ni remember studying his career in school the treaty of alpha cygnus nine the co rid an admission to the federation the klingon alliance\nyou tongue tied\nis it true that hell be retiring after this mission\nwe had planned a ships concert this evening\nif youll follow me sir\nthe way mend rossen described him i expected to see a frail old man\nfrom what i could see the ambassador doesnt need to be protected from anything\nfor all we know the ambassador might enjoy an evenings entertainment\nsomething wrong i asked a question\nanything you d like to talk about geordi\nda matos been an exemplary officer\nof course\nyes i checked in with wesley and geordi a few hours ago there was a moment when i actually thought that the two of them were going to hit one each other\ni dont need to tell you that insubordination is a serious charge to level against any officer\nis it my imagination or have tempers become a little frayed on this ship lately\ngeordi what the hell is going on here\nall right thats enough\nhe has nt been doing a very good job\nsomeone has to confront him\ni dont understand this everyone is protecting sarek his wife mend rossen even you\nthe mission with the leg a rans can not be carried out with sarek in this condition\nthen tell him that there is no way\nwere entering the leg aran system sir shall i have mister worf contact their ambassador\ncaptain i think you did the right thing\nill be on the bridge sir\nvery well\nyes ambassador\ni take it the mind meld was a success\nis captain picard all right\nand the ambassador\nwhat will happen to him then\nmister obrien standby for transport\nhes going to need a lot of rest to prepare himself for the difficult job that awaits him\nperhaps we should allow these gentlemen to return to their work ambassador\nthis is your command centre\ncounsellor troi is a beta zoid\nthen she is not a true telepath\nwhat is captain pi cards background in diplomacy\nand what of his knowledge of the leg a rans would he be able to conduct negotiations with them should the need arise\nforgive me i was merely exploring various possible permutations of our mission your tour of the bridge has been most informative\nhave i given you cause to think otherwise\ni do not recall making such a statement\ni am honour bound to help sarek carry out this mission that is the only answer i can give\ntell your captain the mission is in jeopardy\ni have been using my limited abilities to strengthen your mental discipline\nthat would not be wise\nwith the pressures of the conference behind him i believe i can help maintain his control until we return to vulcan\nwe come to serve\nallow me to present she who is my wife\ni prefer to view the conference room first\ni will examine it for myself\nthey worry about my health captain too much you will take me to the conference room please\nthe room is not ready\nthe leg a rans are very sensitive in matters of protocol you will remove all the furniture from the room the walls must be bare\ni have worked for ninety three years in preparation for this meeting it is vital that no detail be overlooked\nthat will be acceptable these walls are too bright\nit is of no importance\ni said it is of no importance\nmy wife you will leave me now i require solitude\nit was my wife s suggestion that we attend it seemed an ideal diversion perrin can be quite logical when she so chooses\nmust not do what my wife if captain picard wishes to see me he may do so i regret that we have seen so little of each other during this voyage captain\nyou were speaking of your belief that i suffer from bend ii syndrome i have been accused of many things in my life never an excess of emotion\non the contrary i wish to assuage any fears the captain may have regarding my capabilities i believe there is a test for bend ii syndrome i will take it immediately\nthat would be a mistake captain i give you my word i am in perfect health\nis what the captain says true\nperrin were you aware of this sak kathi await an answer\nyour efforts will no longer be required\nit may not be wise but it is necessary\nleave me i wish to speak with captain picard\nobey my wishes there is nothing to fear\nyou seem to forget captain that i am a vulcan i am not affected by emotional considerations\ni am a logical being present your arguments i will listen\nand it is your hypothesis that iam the cause of these incidents\ni share your concern for your crew however you must agree it is not unusual for a starship to encounter unexplained phenomena\ntherefore since i can assure you that i am not the cause of your difficulties the logical course would be to have your doctor to continue her search\nis your entire argument to be based on mere coincidence\nahi believe i see the flaw in your logic you are reacting to their overprotective attitudes towards me they are both somewhat emotional concerning my age\nami to be blamed for the judgment of a child sakka this young and inexperienced he erred in his assumption that i needed help\nwhat happened\ni do not cry\nyou exaggerate captain i recall only one tear\nthat is not possible\nit was late i was fatigued nothing more the leg a rans trust only me they will not meet with any other member of the federation i must be allowed to complete my mission there are no other logical solutions\nwhat i meant was that\ni warn you your efforts to discredit me will not succeed\ni will not be spoken to in this manner\nit would be illogical for a vulcan to show anger it would be illogical illogical illogical illogical captains log supplemental in three hours time we are scheduled to meet with the leg aran delegation however it is now all too evident that ambassador sarek is in no condition to proceed with the conference\na mind meld between the two of us do you realise the dangers involved in what you are proposing captain\nwe would be linked telepathically sharing our thoughts becoming in essence one mind\nit is a generous offer but i must warn you that while i would gain your stability you would experience the fierce onslaught of emotions unleashed by my condition vulcan emotions are extremely intense we have learned to suppress them no human would be able to control them they would overwhelm you the mind meld can be a terrible intimacy i can not allow it\nyour courage honours me captain\ni see that you are ready captain\na sensible precaution\nmy mind to your mind your thoughts to my thoughts\nnumber one please inform the leg aran delegation that sarek of vulcan is on his way to welcome them\nyes all went as planned\ndont worry number one\ni am myself again it has been a long time\ni will take my leave of you now captain i do not think we shall meet again\nwe shall always retain the best part of the other inside us\nlive long and prosper back to

ive heard the same kind of story from ten different people over the last two days\ncaptain this is not an isolated incident there have been reports of random violence all over the ship\nits not that simple captain\ni felt something during the concert vague and undefined but very disturbing\nwell vulcans have the same basic emotions we do theyve just learned to repress them what i sensed during the concert was that he d lost control\nvulcans possess telepathic ability sarek may unintentionally be projecting intense emotions on to other people at random\ni hope your journey aboard the

    "episode 7": "is this the captain picard\ni know you picard\ni am bok daimon of the ferengi i have asked you here to discuss a mutual problem captain\ni insist on speaking of that matter in person shall we meet on your vessel or mine\nas you wish picard perhaps this will begin a new era of cooperation for both our peoples in one earth hour then\nit is our pleasure captain picard might i introduce my first officer kaz ago and my second rata\nwe have heard that you use females clothed females most interesting\nthink nothing of it it is under our control\ndo not be alarmed captain it is a gift from us with which we honour the hero of maxi a\nwhy you picard of course do you not remember the battle of maxi a\nunidentified that fine vessel was ferengi\nsuch mistakes happen in space\nput it on your viewer\nthere is no one aboard it\nno price\nperhaps it is his conscience\nit is about the battle i mentioned captain a gift in honour of that occasion look at that ship closely\nit was a derelict adrift in space on the far side of this star system how it got there is none of my business captain but now that vessel is yours if you wish to have it\nconsider it an act of friendship\ntry this hero of maxi a\nand now dear captain you are ready to live the past\nyou will injure yourself as you once injured me\nwelcome back captain\nshields up computer\ncollecting on an old debt\ni have been waiting along nine years for this picard\ndo you not human can you not remember the crime you committed against my very blood you murdered my only son\nhe was the commander of the ship you destroyed on his first voyage as daimon\nand i have spent these years searching seeking a proper blood revenge and i found it iam rich picard yet two of these cost me the profits of an entire life you are back in command of the stargazer picard its computers will answer your orders die well captain first officers log captain picard has beamed himself to the stargazer which is now moving away from us under its own power\ncaptain picard is in transporter room three\nnew information captain picard is no longer aboard the enterprise\nyou sent for me sir\na what\nof course but i dont often encounter them\ni dont see a thing wrong\nwith your head i see nothing physically wrong but i want to run some additional scans in sickbay\nis an order to report to sickbay from the one person aboard this ship who can give you an order\nonly when my way makes sense captain there are still forty minutes before the ferengi beam over ill have these scans done in ten\nas simple you should not have a headache unless there s something wrong sir it may be true that headaches were once quite common but that was in the days before the brain was charted before we understood the nature of pain when we were suffering from such things as the common cold\ni havent the slightest idea feel better\nmedical fakery the pain is actually still there its just cloaked ill want further exams\nwhen the ferengi matter is settled\nlike before\nyou said you felt something yourself\ntheres nothing burning jean luc\nill do better than that ill go along\nand after i have another look at you captain\nhow do you feel captain\ncaptain another headache this really worries me i want you back on the enterprise\nill see theyre sent to your enterprise quarters\nnot resting captain\nover here\ni wish to hell i knew captain but something unusual has definitely been happening to you\nwhy do captains always act like they re immortal\nyou didnt tell me it had been this bad\nthis should help a little its got to be some kind of emotional pressure connected with the stargazer\nwant to talk about it im here\ndid you have a choice\ncommander rikers told me about the altered log if thats what s troubling you\nsomething to let you sleep\nnumber one id like you to take a look at this brains can graph what are you doing here\nof course you are but i\nunder protest captain\nobviously there s some thought process disorder but i cant find a physical reason for it anything troi\nim busy at the moment wesley\nno they might be affecting the captain to riker\nthe captain commander\nmy son transmissions which exactly match certain anomalies found in the captains brain scans something over there is affecting the captains thought patterns\nso he may not have even known it was there and if this is able to pick up or magnify thought altering transmissions\nboosting it how we will discuss this later\ntime sir\nsecondhand sir oh of course a human joke\ncaptain he may refer to an incident which occurred nine years ago in the maxi a zeta star system in which an unidentified starship\nwhich you destroyed sir\nhardly a mistake sir your report shows that it deliberately attacked\nyou performed what starfleet textbooks now refer to as the picard manoeuvre picard\nsir the ferengi are standing by for us to take possession of the stargazer\nstargazer constellation class starfleet registry 2893\nyou ll find this most intriguing sir\nthe last entry dated nine years ago sir by you we are forced to abandon our starship may she find her way without us apparently she did sir\nstarfleet has responded to our requests ira tug will rendezvous with us and tow the stargazer back to xend i starbase nine\nthe records of the stargazer sir what the ferengi call the battle of maxi a it seems the captains personal log contains a much different version of that conflict than the official historic account\nit would appear that the starship which captain picard attacked had in fact been under a flag of truce\nand apparently the captain destroyed the ship without notice or provocation\nan accident in engineering\nit is logged in his own voice sir would you care to hear it sir sir\nby comparing the stargazers main computer log with captain pi cards personal log i have found checksum discrepancies sir\nall information is time coded by entry and the bits when totaled produce an aggregate amount which\none of these two logs is a forgery sir\nas i said that is one of them is it not\nyes sir whoever tampered with your personal log was clever\nsir\ni have a fix on it sir inside captain pi cards quarters\nconsiderable fire damage to interior surface reported sir but none of her main systems were crippled\nthere is no defence sir\ni have computed a possibility commander since even deep space contains trace gases sir a vessel in the picard manoeuvre might seem to disappear but our sensors could locate any sudden compression of those gases\nthis class starship has enough power to use our tractor beam on it seize it limit its field of fire\nno question of it sir\nand the android was mentioned too what is its price we should like to purchase it\nno price\nwe are not selling it to him\npermission granted riker\na problem riker\nit is now\ncaptain bok has just made me aware of it riker the infamy of your picard is now fully known\ni would call the wanton destruction of an unarmed vessel infamy\ni can hardly imagine you contacted me to discuss an ancient battle what do you want of me\nas you humans say im all ears\nwe freely give you back your derelict warship and now you accuse us of crime riker i can bear no more insults\nwhy is our gift to you under power human\nhe is working in our ships laboratory where is your captain\nhow do you have possession of that\nit is a forbidden device a thought maker if your captain is criminal enough to own one\nit is not seemly to question ones own daimon riker i am not prepared to do that\nfirst officer kaza go to human riker\nwe do not wish to become involved in what has become clearly a federation matter\nyou should also know that daimon bok no longer commands this vessel his first officer has confined him for engaging in this unprofitable venture good luck first officer riker\nyoull be able to see him now sir theyre willing to communicate on visual\nive got something sir\ni read it now sir as a constellation class starship heading this way under impulse power sending no call letters sir\naye sir\ni activated the emergency power cells amazing they still work\ni read about this ship at the academy i never dreamed id ever be on her\naye sir\nopen sir\nsecure sir\ncorrection the log just found aboard the stargazer is a forgery\ncaptain your e looking better sir\nbut a bit clumsy its definitely a fabrication sir\ncommander im reading something very strange here a low intensity beam of intermittent pulse inside this starship\ncommander stargazer is now powering up sir\nit seems to be a network of miniature circuitry sir incredibly complex may be an amplifier\nwhen he put up the shields sir\nthe battle of maxi a sir thats what it is\ni activated the emergency power cells amazing they still work\nyes doctor sit down look this perhaps may be no things but ive been feeling a bit odd of late fatigued and now ive got this damned headache\nheadache headache surely you know what a headache is\nthe reason is obvious of course what are the ferengi up to stand by enterprise standby for what\nno neither can i unless they re baiting some kind of trap\ndoctoral live got is\non my way number one sorry doctor duty calls\nhave they given any hint of what they ve been waiting for\nopen hailing frequencies\nferengi vessel this is captain jean luc picard of the enterprise we are transmitting visually\ndo we know each other\nthen you have the advantage is this bok\nwhat problem is that daimon bok\ni appreciate your offer daimon bok we would like you to be our guest here\nin one hour daimon bok end transmission\nthey did agree a bit easily well in one hour we shall know why\nare you always accustomed to getting your way doctor\nit seems an awful lot of effort for something as simple as a headache\nso whats the cause of my headache\nthe pains gone\ndoctor\nensign answer the first officers question\nthe correct procedure\noh its nothing its just a just a mild headache the correct procedure ensign would have been to signal the bridge of your finding immediately\ntime oh for the ferengi to beam over do you see any problems connected with this old starship coming in number one\nconcur standby\nwelcome you in peace to the enterprise daimon bok\nthis is my first officer commander william riker second in command data counsellor troi\nhe is not for sale commander data is umi sum\none of our starships under your control\nwho\nim sorry i do not remember it daimon bok data\nthe battle of maxi a ive never heard it referred to so dramatically before my sincere regrets bok but that vessel refused to identify itself it simply attacked us we defended ourselves\nmain viewer\nfor what purpose what\nno no im fine\nits right im fine what is this all about\nmagnify please lieutenant laforge\nwhy its the stargazer its my old ship how did you find it\nno it hit with more impact\nare you sure it wasnt one of my thoughts at that moment i was remembering being at the helm of the stargazer a manoeuvre was being made we were hit some things burning i can smell smoke can you smell it\nthat was just part of my memory\nwell it was strong whatever it was are you ready number one\nwe were traveling at warp two through the maxi a zeta star system when this unidentified starship suddenly appeared and fired on us pointblank range\nit must have been lying in some deep moon crater first attack damaged the shields in the confusion they hit usa second time\nno names no reason can you identify them vigo if they come in a second time with our shields damaged\nhes my weapons officer on the stargazer im getting quite caught up in this\ni improvised with the enemy vessel coming in for the kill i ordered a sensor bearing and when it went into the return arc\nand our attacker fired on the wrong one\nit was a save our skins manoeuvre we were finished on fire we had to abandon ship we limped through space in shuttlecraft for weeks before we were picked up i havent thought about this for years\ni want to go over to her\nhello old friend\nwhat did you find data\no him fine doctor lieutenant yar run a structural analysis on the stargazer for an impulse to w data download all computers to the enterprise and file im going to look at my old cabin\nbut my things\nvery well data\nvery strange number one like going back to the house you grew up in but no ones home except the phantoms of the past\nnot half as much as this damn headache take over number one\nthis is a confession given by me jean luc picard commanding stargazer\nwhat does this mean\nit is number one\ni admit i must have mistaken their subspace antenna for a weapons cluster unfortunately i fired our main phasers and our direct hit destroyed the unknown vessel\nthank you will in ever made that log entry of course but it still leaves you with a duty to perform\nand one more full day for their answer to return id like the truth on this by the nid hate to have to prepare a formal defence\nwhy wouldnt they with the ferengi making these friendship overtures i could become a severe embarrassment to starfleet\ndamn ill call the doctor again\nopen hailing frequencies geordi\nyes who the hell is it\nmore like dying doctor\nwhat is wrong with me\nwhy do doctors always say the obvious as though its a revelation\nno\nit wasnt this bad but its getting worse\ni got this headache long before i even knew my old ship still existed still perhaps your e partly right\nthe fight at maxi a i destroyed an entire vessel an entire crew\ni dont know anymore i just dont know\nthe last three nights ive ive heard these voice simon the bridge of my old ship theres fire all around me the klaxon s smoke and then i give the order and now the stargazer

can do for now we wont be able to test neuromuscular function for a few days\nah geordi\nno need to keep you here your bios can came out negative\ni never thought he d make it this far there was major

that the device contains a chemically based system for molecular energy encoding\nthe compact shape does suggest a rapid chemical processing and storage capacity\nan intriguing experiment the capsule might provide us with information without the need to decode the storage medium itself perhaps we should examine your theory immediately\nare you suggesting that it employs memory like an organic cell\nperhaps the information sequences are encoded in the molecular patterns themselves\nit appears that your hypothesis was correct geordi\nwe have determined that the storage cube from john does

destroyed anyone who exhibited the signs of the transfiguration\nby murdering us you saw the mutations as a threat to your authority you were terrified of something you couldnt understand some suspected that what was happening to them was not evil four of us decided to flee z alkon and let the metamorphosis take its course you hunted us down killed the others but i survived with the help of

board\nid like to see the colony site as soon as possible captain\ni dont know exactly what im looking for but weve tested the sections of the enterprises hull that were damaged by the borg there were some unusual magnetic resonance traces\nthats my theory ill see if it holds up tomorrow ive reviewed your personnel ill be assigning mister laforge and mister data to accompany me on the away team\nof course i appreciate any assistance you can offer tell me commander is serving aboard the enterprise as extraordinary an experience as ive heard\ngood because i intend to convince captain picard im the right choice for the job\nyours of course im sorry i heard that you were leaving\ncall\nwell ive only got two pair but ive got to see your hole card ill call\nmorning early bird gets the worm eh weve had some interesting results\nim sorry but i woke up early and i saw that a weather system was moving init it could have affected the soil readings\nreally commander if we ran into the borg here two extra bodies wouldnt ve made a hell of a difference now would they we had three hours before the stormfront hit less than two hours now data was available i took him we came i dont see your problem\nnoted for future reference do you wish to hear my report sir\nthe soil contains the same magnetic resonance traces that sour footprint theres no doubt anymore it is the borg captains log

shelby remains on board to continue tactical preparations\na manipulation effect in the borg ships subspace field a definite pattern at four point eight minute intervals during your first confrontation with them\none theory is that their systems are decentralised with redundant power sources located throughout the ship\nprojections suggest that a borg ship like this one could continue to function effectively even if seventy eight percent of it was inoperable\nwe ve been projecting twenty four\ni think we should look at modifying the plasma phaser design\nsir if you ll allow me to continue with mister data who does not require rest\nif we have a confrontation with the borg without improving our defence systems\nmister laforge has a plan to modulate shield nutation hopefully that ll hold them off for awhile\ni thought they were nt interested in human life forms only our technology\nthe nutation modulation has them confused\ndata fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies random settings keep them changing dont give them time to adapt\ntime index five one four data started to fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies the borgs beam breaks contact slow playback take a closer look commander mister laforge\nend programme unfortunately there is one slight detail in the process the blast completely destroys the enterprise as well\nit could work in the meantime we should retune all phasers including the hand units to the same frequency\nthere is one other recommendation id like to make commander separate the saucer section assign a skeleton crew to create a diversion\nbut it would give them more than one target to worry about\nid like the captain to make that decision sir\ndeck eight battle bridge\nyou never ordered me not to discuss this with the captain\nmay i speak frankly sir\nyoure in my way\nall you know how to do is play it safe i suppose thats why someone like you sits in the shadow of a great man for as long as you have passing up one command after another proceed to deck eight\nif you cant make the big decisions commander i suggest you make room for someone who can captains log stardate 439962 the enterprise remains concealed in the dust cloud and to my surprise theborg have maintained their position waiting for us to come out of hiding i have no explanation for their special interest in me or this ship we continue to prepare our defences for the inevitable confrontation but i must admit on this night i contemplate the distinct possibility that no defence may be adequate against this enemy\nsir we ve got to get that ship down to impulse\nexcuse me sir with my knowledge of the borg\nallright a reminder we only get to use each of these once may be twice before the borg learn to adapt dont fire until you have to\nthat

have to\nat least consult with starfleet command get admiral hanson on subspace\nno help there\nthree jacks looking back for the handsome young ensign pair of deuces stands flush possible straight

are interactive across a subspace domain similar to that of a transporter beam i would hypothesise that these frequencies form the basis of the borgs collective consciousness\npossibly but as you may recall on several occasions we have witnessed the borg removing key circuits from injured comrades no doubt separating them from the group consciousness\nthat is correct sir\nthen perhaps there is a

have you believe i run the entire project\nreally\ni suppose we all find ways to confront our greatest fears\nyou really have kept up havent you the truth is we dont know yet\nyou know its such a shame the government is looking for someone to take over the project a real leader who ll go in there and get things moving and they are looking for you jean luci know i know you d never leave starfleet\nthats what i thought but if nothing else why dont is end over some of the internal studies of the tectonic problem since your e interested we could use any thoughts you might have\nrobert\nim interested to know what you thought about our plans\nwonderful we should discuss them with the board of governors ive set up a meeting\njust a preliminary conversation tomorrow morning\nthey want you i mentioned your interest in the project thats all thats all i had to say they jumped at the prospect\nat least listen to them jean luc\nyou wont regret it jean luci promise you ill see you in the morning\njean luc\nit is so good to finally meet you\nhow are you feeling\nwell robert andi are delighted that youve come to stay with us\ni wouldnt hear of it its your home and it

you to contact him as soon as you resettled\noh yes hes very excited about it hes been made a supervisor no was his wife is constantly reminding anyone who ll listen\nthe mayor wants to give you a parade\ngive you the keys to the city\nwell ive already warned the mayor not to make any plans without talking to us\nthank you\nrobert and i have had more than a few discussions about getting a replicator in the house\nthis is a very old argument\nand he won a ribbon for it\nwhy dont you go and get it and then you can read it to your uncle\njean luc are you all right\nwhy shouldnt you\nconsidering what youve just been through\nbesides it would be wonderful to have you back home given a little time maybe you and your brother might even get to like one another\nyour e not like part of the family you are part of the family jean luc picard\nlouis come in let me get you some wine you can talk business\nwhat in the world what happened here\nhave you two been fighting\nshame on you both what would your father say if he saw you like this\nwell perhaps its just as well you got it out of your systems\nalready jean luc\ncome back and see us again goodbye jean luc and be careful\nhes still out there dreaming about starships and adventures its getting late\nno sir\nwell you know women\ni know what you mean lieutenant\nlast time my old man was on board i found him chasing nurse stanton around a bio bed in sickbay\nyeah but its always something with parents isnt it\nenergising\nmiles edward obrien sir good to meet you\nhmm what o her france labarre my home village\nyes its the first time in almost twenty years\ncounsellor\nits earth its home do i need another reason\nyour help has been invaluable during my recovery but look im better the injuries are healing\nthe nightmares have ended all i need now is a little time to myself\nif you wish to believe that my going home is a direct result of being held captive by theborg be my guest\ni hate it when you do that\nand what better place to find oneself than on the streets of ones home village\nall right whoever you are i can hear you\noh good lord a highwayman\na highwayman its a robber who attacks travellers but none have been reported in this vicinity for centuries\ni am much relieved sir\nthen you have the advantage\nthen you must be my uncle rene\ntoo bad i rather enjoyed the idea\nwell starfleet keeps me very busy\nim sure you misunderstood\nwell robert and i we perhaps its time to change all that\narrogant\nlets talk about that later shall we\nmarie\nfor me too\no him fine\ni was i was thinking ii might be imposing i could very easily stay in the village\nno in fact its amazing how little it has changed everything is exactly as i remember it the house the hills every tree every bush seems untouched by the passage of time\nas it was to our father\nyou look exactly like robert when he was your age i half expect to see myself as a boy come running out that door to play\nrene already told me where is he\nhello robert\nnoi decided to walk i met marie and rene\nits good to see you\nno\nis he still trying to raise the ocean floor\nits really quite exciting actually if you understand the potential of exploring a new world on our own planet\na parade\nnon on ono no\nno he does not im here to rest and spend some time with my family\nis this the forty six\non the contrary i think that syn the hol heightens ones appreciation for the genuine article\nleave it to robert to find the best cookin france then marry her\ni remember the same discussions between mother and father\ni dont see that you have to lose anything just by adding a convenience\ngood for you uncle you know what i once wrote a report about starships when i was about your age\ni dont recall\nno i dont think so\ni am not encouraging him if you werent so narrow minded if you allowed him to see the world as it really is\nno my dear louis two men roberts and my fathers\nno not true i was interested and i was proud that my family were helping to preserve the traditions i just didnt feel bound by those traditions\nthere should be room for both in this life and what about you you old rascal youve taken quite a shift into the future yourself\nyou should have listened to me at the beginning\nand broken your leg\ni hear you ve been promoted to supervisor of the atlantis project\nwell its certainly very exciting work ive kept up on it in the journals\nits only theres just one thing i dont understand you were such a rotten swimmer louis thinking of you working on the ocean floor\nseriously how do you plan to accelerate the build upon the underside of the mantle without increasing the stress on the tectonic plates\non the enterprise we used harmonic resonators to relieve the tectonic pressure sondre ma four obviously its not the same problem but\nno id never leave starfleet\nall right\ni seem to have made a rather disturbing discovery louis mentioned the atlantis project needed a director and i found myself actually thinking about it\nleaving my career the enterprise\nno its not that or is it\nwell i already like his choice in wives i never thanked you for your correspondence it made me feel like part of the family\nwell theres nothing much to talk about\nive only had a chance to glance at them ive a few ideas\nmeeting\npreliminary to what\ni never said there was a prospect\nall right very good fine ill listen\nthats so\nwhats that\nis this brotherly concern\nyou know what happened\nim tired of fighting with you robert\nthats right\nim not a hero\nthats not true\nnoi never sought that rubbish\nvaledictorian arms raised in victory were you so jealous\nright\nwhy didnt you break a few rules\nlook after me you you were a bully\nall right try it now\ndamn you picard\nyou dont know robert you dont know they took everything i was they used me to kill and to destroy and i couldnt stop them i should have been able to stop them i tried i tried so hard but i wasnt strong enough i wasnt good enough i should have been able to stop the mi should i should\nyou know i think you were right after all i think i did come back so that you could help me\nits entirely my fault marie\nwe both fell down\ntogether\nhed probably send us both to bed without our supper\nperhaps it was marie perhaps it was ill contact louis and cancel the meeting with the board of governors its time that i was going\nthe ship will be ready to leave orbit soon and i belong on board if i should ever doubt that again i know where to come\ntake care uncle\nwell theres plenty of time for that you may decide to do something else as you get older\nthank you lieutenant\nyou had the full tour i trust\na what\nbut im not a robber\ni know who you are\nyour e my nephew jean luc from the starship enterprise\nim not your uncle its the other way around\nwhy have you been away so long\nfather says you dont like it here\nno i didnt he said so\nyou know you dont seem so

my starship too\nthank you please take that to engineering\nalready\nyour e just too damned efficient lieutenant\ncontinue with the testing mister worf heres the final schedule for the shore leave and for the personnel transfers by the way im looking forward to meeting your parents\ntheyre on the visitors list you didnt know\nwell im not sure that i would either worf since this isnt a klingon ship if you dont want to see your parents thats your business but we dont get to earth all that often im sure we can arrange for you to have more off duty time while they re here\ndismissed mister worf if youre worried that they might learn about what happened on the klingon planet\nriker to lieutenant worf\ni need to talk to you about the phaser test results\nso you arrived all right welcome home

you shortly\ni see no good reason why the earth should have another subcontinent\nwell im afraid that i do not understand this potential\nhe just needs a little arm twisting dear coaxing\nforty seven you ve been drinking too much of that artificial stuff what do you call it syn the hol its spoiled you ruined your palate\ndelicious marie\nyes but sadly cooking is becoming a lost art thats your wretched technology again\nfather understood better than anybody else the danger of losing those values which we hold most precious\nyou wouldnt but in my view life is already too convenient\nand i dont find your modesty very unconvincing brother of course you won the ribbon you always did\nits hard enough to protect him protect him from all thats out there without you encouraging him\nyou raise your own sons as you would wish and allow me to do the same with mine\ndont worry my dear ive got it\nbusiness\ncareful your e not used to drinking the real thing this syn the hol never leaves you out of control is that so\nthis will now there is something id like to see\nthe gallant captain out of control mind if i ask you a question what the devil happened to you up there\nno curiosity what did they do to you\nnot precisely i gather you were hurt humiliated i always thought you needed a little humiliation or was it humility either would do\nwhy do you walk a way that isnt your style\ntired\nyes tired of the enterprise too the great captain picard of starfleet falls to earth ready to plunge into the water with louis that isnt the brother that i remember still i suppose it must have seemed like the ideal situation hmm local boy makes good returns home after twenty years to a heros welcome\nof course you are admit it youd never settle for less than that and you never will\ncancel the parade in your favour\nnever sought never sought president of the school valedictorian athletic hero with your arms raised in victory\nyes damnit i was always so jealous i had a right to be\ni was always your brother watching you receive the cheers watching you break every rule our father made and get away with it\nbecause i was the elder brother the responsible one it was my job to look after you\nsometimes may be sometimes i even enjoyed bullying you\ndid you come back jean luc did you come back because you wanted me to look after you again\nyes but you need edit you have been terribly hard on yourself\nso my brother is a human being after all this is going to be with you a long time jean luca long time you have to learn to live with it you have a simple choice now live with it below the sea with louis or above the clouds with the enterprise\nyou know what i still dont like you jean luc\nah\nyes i fell down then he fell and then\nwe both fell down\nwe both fell

things\nthere are many possible explanations\nperhaps for human sold things represent a tie to the past\nhumans are mortal they seem to need a sense of continuity\nto give their lives meaning a sense of purpose\ni suppose it is a factor in the human desire to procreate\nit is a reasonable explanation to your query sir\nlore\ni implore you do not reactivate him\nbut he admitted to an alliance with

you just fixme it was within your power to fixme\nnext logical step\ni am not less perfect than lore\ni dont have to imagine i know how hard its been youd be surprised data feelings do funny things you may even learn to understand your evil brother to forgive him we will be more alike data you and i youll see im happy for you\nthe sons of the prophet were valiant and bold and quite unaccustomed

want security teams along the main passageways and in every transporter room and see if the computer would be good enough to give you the precise stun setting to disable mister data\ncomputer estimate the time from this location to starbase four one six at warp nine\nyou have access to it\ndetermine the absolute minimum field energy doctor crusher needs and use the rest to get me onto my

you made your nine year old brother believe that he d killed you\nand then he ran away\nand while he was hiding he ate the fruit of a cove palm\nare you aware of the infectious nature of the parasites which inhabit cove palm\nare you also familiar with the terms i agreed to keep you boys on the enterprise when your parents went on sabbatical\nmister data\nthink about it mister potts and while your eat it think about what may have happened had we not been this close to a starbase medical facility\nwere you able to contact the boys parents\ngood escort this young man to the quarantine anteroom perhaps he could assist us in lifting his brothers spirits\nback so soon mister data\ncourse set by whom\ndata who programmed the new coordinates\nturbo lifts two three four everyone\nlaforge lets get a diagnostic sweep underway\nwere still at the altered heading captain holding at warp nine point three\nwhat the hell is he up to\nive got a clear path to panel j14bakerwhats that going to do for us\nhave theyre inverted the environmental control sequencer\nthen you and casey get up here lets get to it\nwhat the hell was that\ngreat just great\nthe only way we knew wed come out of warp was by looking out a window\nthis has gone far enough data\nwhat she doing\ndoes that mean hell be able to\nbeverly thinks its going to be tight lets hope he didnt take us too far off course\nwell at least thats something what have you got\ngeordi if the computers programmed to allow data to transport down it would figure that it would allow him to be am backup right\nand data would have left a trace imprint when he beamed down\nso what would be involved in pulling that trace and finding a way to make the computer think someone else is data may be a few someone elses\nnobody knows the transporters better than obrien and laforge they tell me theyve managed more than a little sleight of hand with our authorisation codes\nthe computer should think all three of us are data\ni just hope we dont all beam back looking like data\nand data\nset them on stun\nworf\nits all right take it easy\nthats impossible soon gs dead\nhere let me\nwould you mind telling me whats going on here\ntried to tell who damnit data whats going on\nmister data theres a very sick little boy onboard the enterprise whos not getting any better were dead in the water until you get us out of here\nwell discuss it later mister data doctor your e coming with us too you need to get to sickbay\nyour e right on time\nopen one of these and one of these there you are\ni sent for you in a manner of speaking\ni always loved that face please sit down\nim sure your starship will be back for you soon please sit down\ntell me doi look somewhat familiar to you\nthere we are its your lucky day data youve found your long lost

but\ngood good good good keep it up keep it up old tom handy swore you d never master that data data whistle for me\noh well all right thats enough sit down beautiful beautiful you know ive been able

let endar see jono\nyou see im not convinced the boy has been abused doctor ive talked with the father and if ia many judge of character i would say that he deeply cares for the boys welfare\nyes

this ship but it was not jon os it was mine when we found jono it seemed so clear what had to be done we knew that if only we could persuade him to make the decision to stay then you would most likely let him so with the best of intentions we tried to convince him and in so doing we thoroughly failed to listen to his feelings to his needs that was the crime and it has taken a huge toll on a strong

just after i was born some people took care of us for a few months then one day we came home and they were gone so tasha took care of me and when i was old enough i joined the coalition\nmy sister hated the cadres she blamed them for our parents death for everything she refused to join and she left as soon as she had the chance i always thought she was weak for doing that but maybe i was wrong may be maybe she made the right choice to work together for something besides killing to be close to someone without having to protect your back very appealing your e the perfect example i hardly even

in a configuration ive never seen before\nexcuse me captain ive run safety and operational inspections captain everything checks out all right but i wont make any claims as to its comfort\nthe radiation levels from that ship are off the scale\nyou mean its a garbage scow\ni dont like the idea of getting close enough to that barge to to wit the radiation levels are so high wed be risking the contamination of the entire crew\nwe could send over a construction module to attach thrusters to it then we could direct it through the asteroid belt from a safe distance\nthrusters are attached and ready commander\npre fire command transmitted thrusters to stand by\nweve lost one module correcting thrust vectors to compensate\nwere already at the maximum limits of our towing speed commander\nyes sir datamonitor the shearing effect on the beam increasing to one half impulse\nincreasing to three quarters impulse\ni cant divert any more power to the shields were already hitting our maximum

dimensional\nsubspace signals photon torpedoes no things had an impact it is reasonable to wonder if a gravitational pull even as strong as a cosmic strings would affect them\nwhat if they ve chosen a course to the cosmic string a case of pure stimulus response driven by instinct just like the moth to a flame\nits all right theyre home we were wrong the cosmic string it was never dangerous to them it was the one place in the galaxy they most wanted to be\nyes i sensed it\nsuch overwhelming intensity of emotion when we first encountered them it must have been more than my senses could

ago and i dont want to be known as the dancing doctor again\nall right but lets keep this between you and me\nhi data well what do you think it is a recreation of the studio i had my first dance

genetic record of the ambassador when she beamed aboard the enterprise now the breakdown of the organic material found on the transporter pad should be identical mitochondrial structure fits the general parameters no change in the nucleotide bases theres a slight discrepancy in the base pair sequence chemically these are identical however the organic sample from the transporter is showing numerous single bit errors like replicated material\nid say the was either mutated by the transporter during there materialisation process\nor the sea rent the remains of the ambassador\nin reference to your most recent letter i agree that your study lacks sufficient primary source information on my programming and operation therefore in response to your request this correspondence will include a complete record of my activities during a normal day with particular emphasis on my perceptions of friendship\ncommander riker you are fifteen minutes early\nthank you sir\ni can not become nervous sir however i do sense a certain anticipation regarding my role in the wedding\nall systems normal sir sickbay reports that lieutenant juarez went into labour at zero four hundred hours we remain at station awaiting the arrival of starship zhukov and guest quarters have been prepared for ambassador tp el\naye sir\ninitially commander maddox i found it difficult to maintain friendships since human emotions are often puzzling to me\neventually i developed a programme enabling me to predict human emotional responses to specific actions\nit is time for the wedding rehearsal\nyou do not wish to rehearse\nmay i ask why\nhave your feelings for chief obrien changed\nwill cancelling the wedding make you happy\nif you wish\nmy friend chief obrien often says that above all else he wants to make keiko happy since cancelling the wedding will make her happy i must conclude the chief will be pleased at her decision\ni have good news\nkeiko has made a decision designed to increase her happiness she has cancelled the wedding\ncommander maddox it would appear that my programme designed to predict the emotional responses needs adjustment second officers personal log supplemental this is the one thousand five hundred fiftieth day since the enterprise was commissioned besides the arrival of ambassador tp el other events occurring today include four birthdays two personnel transfers a celebration of the hindu festival of lights two chess tournaments one secondary school play and four promotions overall an ordinary day\nenergise\nwelcome aboard the enterprise ambassador\nsine i am not affected by emotional considerations i am closer to being vulcan than human however while their devotion to logic does have a certain appeal i find their stark philosophy to be somewhat limited\nthe tone of commander rikers voice makes me suspect that he is not serious about finding ambassador tp el charming my experience suggests that in fact he may mean the exact opposite of what he says irony is a form of expression i have not yet been able to master\nfriendly insults and jibes another form of human speech that i am attempting to master in this case with the help of commander geordi laforge\ni consider geordi to be my best friend\nmy hair does not require trimming you l unk head\nmy hair does not require trimming\ni am experimenting with friendly jibes and insults it was not meant as a serious disparagement\nno geordi i am still confused by chief obrien s reaction this morning\ncold feet jitters a nervous reaction to an impending event of great importance\nshe will\nso you believe the wedding will still proceed\ni find lieutenant worf to be what is called a kindred spirit we were both orphans rescued by starfleet officers in many ways we are both still outsiders in human society\nare you here to find a wedding gift\ni would appreciate your help in selecting an appropriate item\nthis is a traditional gift\nit is my understanding that the item selected should reflect the personality of whoever is giving it this does not remind me of you have you ever been an actual participant in a human wedding\nyou would not consider it to be an honour\ndancing\ni am rarely in need of doctor beverly crushers professional services as my biomechanical maintenance programme is self sufficient but i often observe as she practices medicine on others and have learned a great deal about human interaction from her\ndoctor may i ask a favour of you\nwould you teach me how to dance\ni would like to learn how to dance\nit was in your service record awarded first prize tap and jazz competition saint louis academy\nhave i said something to upset you\nthen your answer is no\nof course doctor\nacknowledged\ncaptain is there a specific area you wish me to study\nit is fortunate that i am able to perform my duties without emotional distractions if that were not the case a sudden course correction toward the neutral zone would make me very nervous\npersonal log supplemental commander maddox there are still many dynamics of social interaction which i do not understand\ntheir ships are deployed to support a policy of confrontation designed to test federation defenses along the neutral zone\ni project a ninety percent probability that they will continue to support that policy\nno sir\nfeline supplement seventy four\ncomputer run fluidic sensor diagnostic\ncome in\nno would you care to sit down\nwhen one of my friends is distraught i have learnt that the thoughtful thing to do is to attempt to make him feel more comfortable\nmay i offer you some refreshment chief\nthere is no need to apologise i was not offended would you like a pillow or a more comfortable chair to sit up on\nperhaps you would like some music brahms aurelia\nwould counsellor troi not be a more appropriate choice to speak with keiko\ni do not know what to say to her\nperhaps she has not fully analysed her decision i will try\ncommander maddox i noted that keiko was quite calm and rational when she informed me of her decision this morning therefore i can predict that she will respond to an objective analysis of the situation based on the available facts it is fortunate that she has not let emotional considerations cloud her judgement it should make my task much simpler\ni believe you made an incorrect analysis of the facts at hand\nyou do not seem happy\nyour decision was based on the assumption that cancelling the wedding would bring you happiness this has proved to be incorrect\nsince your action did not produce the desired results the only advisable solution should be to reexamine your decision making process and look for errors\nthat fact is not in dispute however you may have acted with undue haste and in doing so unintentionally hurt chief obrien s feelings\ni am your friend\nif i have offended\nit is clear that i need guidance to resolve this situation counsellor trois advice should be useful\nin many ways deanna troi is the friend that i understand the least her life and her duties are predicated on her understanding and perception of emotions since i have none no doubt she finds me as much of a mystery asi find her\nchief obrien talks to me keiko talks to you why do they not talk to each other\nmany aspects of this situation are puzzling tomei have been studying various texts on the subject of marriage but i have not found a suitable guide\nin an effort to be helpful i am attempting to calculate the variables involved in a successful marriage\nthere are many opinions on galvin five a marriage is considered successful only if children are produced within a year of the wedding andorian marriages require groups of four people unless\nbut i am their friend should i not stand with them in a time of difficulty\ndo you believe it to be the right decision for them to marry\nto grow old together that is an integral component of marriage\nalthough i a man android i have not excluded the possibility that i too may someday marry\ni believe i have much to offer a potential mate however we can not grow old together because i will not grow old\nacknowledged\nthat is correct ambassador\nthe code is valid\nmay i ask the purpose of your request\ni have the same safeguards as the ships computer therefore i must report any inquiry regarding restricted information to the captain your reaction suggests you do not wish the captain to be informed of your inquiry\ncommander maddox i have often wished for the sense that humans call intuition or instinct since vulcans are incapable of lying i must accept the ambassadors explanation as the truth but i would still prefer a gut feeling to backup this conclusion\nit appears to be quite suitable doctor\nami dancing doctor\ndoctor perhaps it would be beneficial to show me the final lesson\nthen i have successfully learned to dance\nthank you doctor i am now prepared to dance at the wedding\nkeiko s wedding\nis that important\nwhy\nsorry doctor\ni can not reproduce your performance if i can not see your feet\nlead where doctor\nand how is that accomplished\nthis is a very complex set of variables to coordinate doctor\ni will thank you doctor\ncomputer create dance partner female begin music\ncommander rikers easy going manner and sense of humour is fascinating to me i believe it to be one reason he is so popular among the crew it may also be partly responsible for his success in matters of love there may be a correlation between humour and sex the need for more research is clearly indicated\ncommander\nsir we have reached the designated coordinates\ncaptain i am detecting a ship in the neutral zone configuration romulan warbird\nengaging computer override\ncaptain there is no prior record of this type of accident occurring aboard a starship backup systems and safeguards are designed to prevent just such an occurrence\naye sir\ncaptain picard was the person who first interested me in the works of sir arthur conan doyle i have subsequently become a great admirer of the fictional detective sherlock holmes and his ability to solve mysteries by careful examination of the available evidence\ni have found holmes methodology of deductive reasoning to be quite useful one of his adages is that once you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth\nthat is not my purpose i would like to examine the remains of ambassador tp el left on the transporter pad\nhave you compared the genetic code with the ambassadors last recorded transporter id traces\ni could be chasing an untamed or nith oid without a cause\ncan you postulate an explanation for the discrepancy\na supposition not supported by the transporter records\nthe only abnormality found during my investigation was a temporary increase in the matter to energy signal ratio due to the circumstances i decided to investigate the possibility that a second transporter signal had caused the fluctuation although this was highly improbable it was the only remaining theory\nfrom the dev or as\nwhile simultaneously a small amount of genetically similar material was left in the ambassadors place\nyes sir\nthe safest and most logical decision in this situation is to contact starfleet and await further instructions however based on past experience i project only a seventeen percent chance captain picard will choose that alternative\nthe dev or as is dropping out of warp sir their weapon systems are powering up\naye sir\nin the game of poker there is a moment when a player must decide if an opponent is being deceptive or actually holds a winning hand this decision is based not only on the odds but also on an appraisal of the man is he bluffing or does he have the cards\nkeiko i need your help i have offended you and need to find a way to rectify my mistake i am not sure what to do\ni should not have interfered it would be best if i apologised\nbut\ni am not nervous i am confused\nthere are still many human emotions i do not fully comprehend anger hatred revenge but i am not mystified by the desire to be loved or the need for friendship these are things i do understand\ni was looking for doctor crusher\nthe juarez child\nvery well i have the bridge\nif being human is not simply a matter of being born flesh and blood if it is instead a way of thinking acting and feeling then i am hopeful that one day i will discover my own humanity\nbegin nightwatch\nuntil then commander maddox i will continue learning changing growing and trying to become

mad\npicardi have to tell you i was grateful when i realised it was you starfleet sent after me somebody who knows what its really like out here\nthen listen to this the cardassians are arming again that so called science station military supply port\ninformation comes my way\ni know what they redoing i can smell it theres no good reason for a science station in the cuellar system but its a hell of a strategic site for a military transport station a jumping off point into three federation sectors theyre running supply ships back and forth and nobodys going to tell me its for scientific research\nand wait six months while the bureaucrats sit around reading reports trying to figure out what to do they dont know whats going on out here but you should picard you know what its like to be under fire\nlives were at stake\nwe had to act now\nit smells musty in here like a bureaucrats office\ni have prevented war or at the very least delayed it a good long time the peace treaty was a ruse to give them breathing room time to regroup\ni took the initiative i did what had to be done\nnot true not true\nyour e a fool picard history will look at you and say this man was a fool\nwhen it becomes clear what the cardassians have done i will be vindicated\nirrelevant come with me find one of their supply ships and well see how irrelevant it is\ni will return to my ship\nyes captain\nall right picard you need proof you ve got it now\nboard the ship youll see that everything ive been saying is true\npicard if you dont board that ship ill destroy it\nnot now\nhow the devil did you get over here\nthe way out of this is clear talk to picard get him to board the damned ship\nbut he d turn his weapons on a federation starship to protect the enemy i dont believe it\nwhatthehell has happened to this war\nyour e wrong the cardassians live to make war\nwere not the same at all we do not start wars we do not make surprise attacks on manned outposts we do not butcher women and children in their homes children who never got the chance to grow up you were with me onset lick you saw what they did\nwhat was the name of the fellow who always hung around you like a puppy\nstomp ie as cool under fire as a mountain lake\nhe died at set lick didn the\nwhat was that song of his the one he always sang the one i liked\nim not going to win this one ami chief\nwhat is it\nsweetheart im not a fish\nwhat no muffins or oatmeal or corned beef and eggs\nkeiko ive been thinking you ve been introducing me to all this wonderful food that your e accustomed to id like to do the same isnt that what marriage is about sharing\nscalloped potatoes mutton shank sox tails and cabbage\noh youll love it i promise i can still remember the aromas when my mother was cooking\nshe didnt believe in a replicator she thought real food was more nutritious\nyeah like a masterchef she was fantastic of course ill have to use the replicator but ill make something special for you tonight youll love it i promise\nsome things wrong\nmore like sabotage sir it was onset lik three a squad of cardassian militia made a sneak raid on an outpost wiped out close to a hundred civilians\nthats not what i meant\ncaptain maxwell would never\ndeck six\nyes he is\nill have to get commander laforge s approval on that\nif my commander tells me to discuss the transporter with you iwill if captain picard orders me to tell you everything i know about ben maxwell i will but who i choose to spend my free time with thats my business\nthere you are potato casserole a dish fit for kings\nthe minstrel boy to the war has gone\nwhat oh its just an old song a bunch of us used to sing it together on the rutledge i hadnt thought about it in years\noh its about war and glory the minstrel boy to the war has gone in the ranks of death you will find him his fathers sword he hath girded on and his wild harps lung behind him captain maxwell always liked that song i guess its all this business with him and the cardassians brought it back to me you know sitting with the staff this morning i could tell there were people in that room who still dont like the cardassians\nyou do\ncapers but the fighting is over now why should anyone still feel however they feel\nwell there were some skirmishes when i was with captain maxwell\nme i feel fine i mean the wars over now\ncaptain\nanything i can do sir you know that\nhe sar are one allright i count myself lucky sir ive served with the two finest captains in starfleet\ntheresa reason for what he s doing those cardassians were up to something im sure of it\nid say he took it well oh i know he was broken up inside who wouldnt be but you d never know it to see him he never missed a minutes duty always had a smile a joke\nhe would never retaliate out of vengeance no matter what that cardassian says they re up to something sir theyre the ones you should be investigating not captain maxwell\ni like them fine its just well i know them you learn to watch your back when your e around those people\ni dont know what to say sir but he must have had his reasons\nmind if i join you\nkana ri never could develop a taste for it\ni wanted to say i owe you an apology i shouldnt have popped off like that in the turbolift\ni guess thats true i hadnt thought of it like that i was onset lik three with captain maxwell the morning after the massacre we were too late of course almost everyone was dead\nthe only people left alive were in an outlying district of the settlement i was sent there with a squad to reinforce them cardassians were advancing on us moving through the streets destroying killing i was with a group of women and children when two cardassian soldiers burst ini stunned one of them the other jumped me we struggled one of the women threw me a phase randi fired the phaser was set at maximum the man just incinerated there before my eyes id never killed anything before when iwasaki did worry about swatting a mosquito its not you i hate cardassian i hate what i became because of you\nhello captain good to see you again\nthank you sir\nwell if thats true i learned it from you sir\naye sir\nsir captain maxwell if he feels his back is to the wall hell strike\nsir let me beam over try to talk to him we served together a long time when you ve been through what we have you tend to get inside someone he might listen\nthe phoenix is using a high energy sensor system it cycles every five point five minutes between cycles theresa window of a fiftieth of a second trust mei can get through\nim not armed\ni had the thought that if we could talk we could figure a way out of this mess\nhe wont do that sir\nhe will count on it\nsir there is now ar the war is over\nthats what everybody thinks about the enemy thats probably what they think about us\nyes sir\nwill kayden stomp ie\nyes sir\nyes sir\nthe minstrel boy to the war has gone in the ranks of death you will find him\none faithful harp shall praise thee\nno sir captains log supplemental captain maxwell has turned his ship over to his first officer and transported aboard the enterprise i have confined him to quarters for the return voyage\nid just like to say sir he was a good man what he did was terribly wrong i know that now but im still proud to have served with him\nbe on the lookout for a cardassian patrol ship mister worf they should be hailing us soon\nlast time i was in this sector i was on the stargazer running at warp speed ahead of a cardassian warship\nbelieve it id been sent to make preliminary overtures to a truce id lowered my shields as a gesture of goodwill but the cardassians were not impressed they had taken out most of my weapons and damaged the impulse engines before i could regroup and run\ni hope their scout ship makes contact soon its not a good idea to stay too long on a cardassian border without making your intentions known\nincrease power to forward shields hail them again mister worf\nevasive action delta sequence ready phasers mister worf\nlimit targets to engines and shields\nfire\ncontinue phaser fire\nlets see if they ll answer our hail now mister worf\nthis is captain jean luc picard of the federation starship enterprise\nwhy have you fired on us\nthere is a treaty between our peoples\na federation starship\ngul mac et the federation and the cardassians have struggled too hard for peace to abandon it so easily\nlet me talk to my superiors find out whats behind this give me one hour the alternative is for us to continue firing at one other and in such a contest you would be at a disadvantage\nben maxwell but he s one of starfleet s finest captain she must have had provocation\nthen he s still in cardassian space\nwill the cardassians cooperate\nthere will be three cardassians transporting aboard their captain gul mac et and two of his aides my intention is to be as open as possible with them allow them to share in our search for the phoenix\ntheyre our guests mister worf i dont want them to feel like prisoners\nvery well lets limit their access but you instruct your people they are guests\ncounsellor i want you to stay as close to the crew as possible some of them may feel uncomfortable with cardassians on board i dont want any incidents\nmister data is there anyone else on board who served previously with captain benjamin maxwell\nindeed number one will you and the counsellor meet our guests in transporter room three and inform chief obrien i will be calling on him\nof course you are concerned gul mac et it is precisely because of that fact that i have included you in every aspect of our effort you represent with my staff you rehearing reports as i hear them nothing edited nothing withheld\ntransporter chief obrien has served with benjamin maxwell i thought that he might be able to provide some insights mister obrien i understand that captain maxwell lost his family during a raid on an outpost\ngentlemen please lets not indulge in speculation can we confine our discussion to facts now mister obrien\ngo ahead mister worf\ngul mac et will you join me on the bridge\nensign set a course warp six mister worf send a message by subspace tell them to prepare for a rendezvous\nyes\nim sure that s true however given the circumstances i would prefer to make the initial contact myself im sure you would if the situation were reversed\ncaptain so far we have an isolated incident if i can reach him first then perhaps diplomacy can prevail but if one of your ships decides to retaliate there is a danger we could lose control of the situation\nno i wont\nthe pursuing ship is the phoenix\nwe are able to make that determination\nthe important thing at the moment is that one of your ships may be in jeopardy mister worf has there been any answer to our communication\nput out a repeating message on all subspace channels priority one communiqu break off your pursuit immediately\ngul mac et you see we are doing everything in our power to reach the phoenix\nmister data\nmister worf has there been any response to our hails\nvery well mister worf relay the prefix codes of the phoenix to the cardassian warship\ni can not allow maxwell to ambush that supply ship mister worf now\nmister data overlay weapon ranges of the two ships\ndoes the supply ship have any weapons\nmister data estimated time to intercept with the phoenix\nensign increase to warp nine\nchief i wanted to talk to you\nben maxwell he must be quite a man\nfrom your knowledge of the man what has gone wrong\nwhen his family was killed how did he take it\ni see\nyou dont care for the cardassians\nben maxwell has just sent more than six hundred of them to their deaths\ni think when one has been angry for a very long time one gets used to it and it becomes comfortable like old leather and finally it becomes so familiar that one cant ever remember feeling any other way thank you chief\nlieutenant\nmister worf please accompany him\nyou have the bridge number one\nyou may take whatever action against him you feel is appropriate i consider the matter closed\nif there is to be a lasting peace gul mac et neither you nori must allow anyone man to undermine our efforts\npicard here\nthat ll be all commander\ncaptain\nplease sit down\nthe thought had occurred\ni know of nothing out here that could possibly justify what you have done\nhow do you know this\nfrom whom where is your documentation\nbut whatever circumstances you encountered why didnt you notify starfleet\nyou werent under fire\nwhose lives\nwhy\nyou have killed nearly seven hundred people and you have taken us to the brink of war\nand so all alone you decided to dispose of the treaty\nwhat had to be done for whom why does a man with a long and brilliant service abandon the fundamental principles that he has believed in even fought for all his life i believe it is because of what they did to your wife and your children\nto avenge their deaths\nill accept the judgement of history\nwhat the cardassians have or have not done is irrelevant\nwere not going after anymore cardassian ships your e going to return to your bridge and set a course for starbase two one one the phoenix and the enterprise will return to federation space together those are starfleet s orders i will permit you the dignity of retaining your command during the voyage the only alternative is to put you in the brigand to tow your ship back to starbase in disgrace\nyou understand your orders\nmister worf report to my ready room my guest is departing\nmister data how long until we clear cardassian space\nmister worf send a message to admiral haden at starfleet inform him of our projected time of arrival\nensign change course to pursue mister worf will you hail captain

of doing\non screen\ncaptain maxwell you have disobeyed a direct order\nthe cardassian vessel will not be boarded you will transport yourself aboard the enterprise\nand i will use whatever force is necessary to prevent you from taking that action captain\nred alert it seems you were right mister obrien ready phasers load torpedoes\nmake it so\nthank you chief\nthank you chief and well done that ll be all\nthe loyalty you would so quickly dismiss does not come easily to my people gul mac et you have much to learn about us benjamin maxwell earned the loyalty of those who served with him you know in war he was twice honoured with the federations highest citation for courage and valour and if he could not find a role for himself in peace we can pity him but we shall not dismiss him\none more thing mac et maxwell was right those ships were not carrying scientific equipment were they are search station within arms reach of three federation sectors cargo ships running with high energy subspace fields that jam sensors\ni was here to protect the peace a peace that i firmly believe is in the interests of both our peoples if i had attempted to board that ship i am quite certain that

really hoping you d try it yourself\nyes sir captain whatever you say\ni pity you we live in a universe of magic which evidently you can not see ah my pale friend has returned have you finished examining the contract\nsuch speed and accuracy your e much too talented to be human\nandroid of course how wonderful an unexpected bonus\nyes when the contract came to termi gained clear title to the

break into the station the planet is in chaos looting s fires mass hysteria these people are all convinced their world is coming to an end tomorrow please we must have your immediate captains log

emergency we need help\ntheyre in\nthe people invent a x two live in an agrarian society at least they do now\nits an interesting anthropological question one we were studying before the trouble began in the distant past the venta xian culture had achieved an extremely advanced scientific level but a millennium ago they turned their backs on technology\nand remained that way for centuries first contact was made by a klingon expedition seventy years ago since then the new technology has been available to the venta xian s they simply are not interested in it virtually no social problems to be found on this planet in fact i would have described their society as idyllic until\nits hard to believe several years ago a cost jared the venta xian head of state began to grow increasingly obsessed with the legend of ar dra with each passing day he grew more anxious and he talked about little else ar dra is coming back ar dra will be here soon we must all leave before a rdr a returns\nfor all intents and purposes the devil captain these people actually believe they ve sold their souls to the devil\nhostage\njared you must secure the release of my people i cant believe you would allow this\na rdr as arrival was supposed to be heralded by the shaking of the cities now there has been a series of geological tremors on the planet minor quakes nothing extraordinary\nthere are ancient scrolls concerning ar dra that are stored in the athenaeum vaults scholars study them they have been of little public interest until recently\nthis is clark you did it captain thank goodness\nand creating a minor tremor could be the result of a low frequency tractor beam projected against the tectonic plates\nit was too brief to pinpoint\nthe decay rate of these z particles makes it almost impossible to trace the source\nthat would put it in orbit above the western magnetic pole running visuals can nothing\naye sir\nfor that matter could she beq\nlike a magician\ni dont\ni dont

why theres more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are humbug i tell you humbug\nyour courtesy is appreciated sir but i am aware that i do not effectively convey the fear called for in this scene\nsir that is not an appropriate basis for an effective performance not by the standards set by my mentors\nyes sir i have studied the philosophies of virtually every known acting master i find myself attracted to stanislavsky adler gar nav proponents of an acting technique known as the method\nperhaps because the technique requires an actor to seek his own emotional awareness to understand the character he plays\nsiri have modified the method for my own uses since i have no emotional awareness to create a performance i am attempting to use performance to create emotional awareness i believe if i can learn to duplicate the fear of ebenezer scrooge i will be one step closer to truly understanding humanity\nshe is a cornerstone of venta xian theology it seems that a rdr a came to venta x two and promised one thousand years of peace and prosperity for a price upon her return she would enslave the entire population invent a xian culture it is considered bad luck to speak her name out loud\nwe have scanned the tectonic stress patterns of your planets crust there is no evidence that the quakes pose any kind of threat\nso you do purport to be the mythic figure a rdr a\ni have sir\nthe contract agrees to deliver the people of venta x two into the personal servitude of a rdr a after one thousand years of peace i have compared the terms to the body of laws which govern the planet the language of the agreement is correct in every detail sir\ni a man android\nim afraid the contract could be interpreted in that way sir captains log supplemental although i consider this womans claim upon my ship to be an empty threat it has further inspired my determination to expose her for the fraud she is\nyou wished to see me sir\nbarnum sir pt\nsir do you believe ar drais to use the vernacular a con artist\nsiri must point out that the venta xian s did have one thousand years of peace and tranquility as promised by a rdr a\nindeed sir in the story the spirits used fear to motivate scrooge to reform his character\nsir the language of the contract seems carefully chosen to avoid any loopholes\naye sir\nsiri believe i have found an obscure precedent invent a xian law which may be of interest\nthe case involves a contract dispute over services rendered by a klingon craftsman on the construction of a venta xian home because the dispute involved an alien culture the parties decided that arbitration rather than the courts should resolve the issue both sides agreed to choose an arbiter it is the only known case involving an alien claimant\nshuttlecraft one to enterprise prepare for docking sequence\ni can not locate the enterprise anywhere within one lightyear of the planet sir\na rdr a before he responds may i have a word in private with captain picard\nsiri request you reject me as arbitrator\nar drais right if i am chosen i will perform my duties without bias or sentiment i can not guarantee i will deliver a verdict in your favour\nsiri will have to follow the rules of conduct for a venta xian jurist\ncaptain picard my interpretation of venta xian law suggests under these circumstances this is acceptable your objection is overruled\nsiri have ruled please sit down you may proceed\ni find no cause to invalidate the contract at this time the arbitration will continue\nit is highly irregular to question the opposing advocate but i see no reason to deny it proceed\nsustained the advocate will refrain from expressing personal affections for her opponent\nyou are out of order\nthe advocate will refrain from making her opponent disappear\nanymore disruptions and i will rule you in contempt of court is that understood\nsustained i will draw my own conclusions if you do not mind sir\nrebuttal\ncaptain picard do you have any further evidence to present before i render judgment\ngeordi one hour recess is granted\ni think he deserves some leeway overruled but that will be quite enough captain\nyour leeway has run out captain\nwith the advocates withdrawal the contract is hereby dissolved this arbitration is adjourned\ncongratulations sir\ncan you explain it picard\nah but i am iam the guardian of greth or where the dishonoured go when they die\nimpudence is pretending to be fek lhr of klingon\nhoward my friend you know how i abhor all acts of violence but events are out of my control\nas the hour of a rdr as return approaches fear has overwhelmed my people it has been a thousand years the prophecies have come true\nthere is more for several nights there have been vision so far dra again just as the contract said would occur before her return\nno she has appeared i myself have seen her\ni am afraid it will not matter they know your weapons are useless against her captain i will make inquiries concerning the hostages the innocent should not suffer from our sins but i can make no promises\ncaptain picard you shouldnt have come your life is in danger here\nno reason\nnon ono the threat is from ar dra you can not understand\nshe is here\na rdr a most powerful one iam jared leader of venta x two i take responsibility for all that displeases you please do not punish my people\nthank you a rdr a\nthe scroll so far dra captain\nit is no longer my decision captain\nyes a rdr a panic gripped the people as the time of your return grew closer\nimmediately\na thousand years ago our planet was dying overcrowded and dangerous city states warred unceasingly with each other the air and water were polluted with industrial waste and there was a constant threat of starvation and epidemic\nand then you came\nyes by the date\nby the shaking of the cities and by the visions\nyes\naccording to the scrolls you offered us a thousand years of peace and prosperity if we would promise to surrender ourselves to you at the end of the term\nwe had nothing to lose there was no hope insight\nnot he changes occurred gradually over a long period of time\nno historical records indicate a council was convened to assess our options they drew up a new constitution which the population later ratified\nno\nno our leaders did that and they signed a treaty of non aggression\nwe shifted our economy from an industrial to an agrarian base it was more ecologically sound\nnot he record shows there were a series of initiatives covering everything from atmospheric contaminants to waste disposal\na rdr a had left venta x two before the environmental reforms began\nno doubt at all\nyes a rdr a\nyes i would say so\nyes\nbut we have seen her powers here\nim sorry captain picard but you are not a rdr

credibly could be called the devil than you\nyou claim you visited this planet a thousand years ago and negotiated a contract\ni would like to see that contract\nyou wont mind if i dont take your word

the best unclear think about it mister worf transporter technology can make things appear and disappear the illusion that she can transform herself into a klingon creature could be created by holographic projection\nwe are capable of recreating all of these events its just that she dresses them up and she delivers them with more dramatic flair\nexactly\nnumber one i want you and mister worf to run high resolution scans of this star system look for a ship a base of operations anything large enough to generate that power mister laforge accompany doctor clark back to the science

planet surface\nensign put up the shields until further notice\nreport mister data\ncome\nyes mister data a wise man once said there is a sucker born every minute\nive been examining the dynamics of what used to be called the con game quite fascinating worthy of your study data\nyes i do data and i believe it is our job too utc on the con artist\nwe can only speculate what occurred on that planet a thousand years ago may be a venta xian leader saw the destruction of his society at hand and he conceived this contract of ar dra to motivate change or maybe there was an ar dra of some sort who is the basis of this mythology who knows the point is that somehow a fundamental theology was created which transformed this society but in the process of change created this latent fear which has been passed down through generations data from your own experience of performing ebenezer scrooge your e aware how fear can be a very powerful motivator\nand in the hands of a con artist fear can be used to motivate obedience capitulation the exploitation of innocent people and that is what i believe has happened here i intend to prove that i need to find a loophole some way of challenging the validity of this contract\ncheck it again mister data and check every venta xian legal precedent for the last one thousand years well talk again in the morning\npicard to bridge intruder alert picard to bridge\nthis is becoming very tiresome\nyou know there s nothing about you i find tantalising on the contrary i find you obvious and vulgar\noh yes\ni think not\nneither was i\nits all right mister worf\na rdr a somehow transported me here will you beam me directly to my quarters\njust have mister data fetch me in a shuttle and have him bring along a uniform\nyes i did\nmister laforge and doctor clark have made no headway commander riker and lieutenant worf have picked nothing up anything on their scans\nyes\nthats exactly what i needed well done data\nenterprise enterprise do you readme

to find that source if we are to defeat this woman\nwhat have you done with my ship\ni do not recognise your claim on the enterprise nor on this world for that matter in accordance with venta xian legal precedenti call for an arbitration\noh but there is your e a fraud madame and i intend to prove that you could not have affected the changes that took place on this planet\nan illusion magicians

she can not intimidate\ni understand youll make a fine judge\nobjection there is no conclusive evidence that this woman ever visited the planet a thousand years ago\nthat would be acceptable\nbut your honour\nobjection\nyour honour nothing in this testament proves that a rdr a had the power to affect the lives of the venta xian s my opponent has failed to prove her case and i move that her claim be summarily dismissed\nobjection\nno i dont\nno\njared youve described quite thoroughly the history of your people before and after a rdr as first visit but i am a little unclear about the change itself did ar dra simply snap her fingers and transform the planet into this paradise\ndid she personally form the government that so peacefully ruled this planet for a millennium\ni see so she advised this council\nno then she must have destroyed all the weapons on the planet\nwell then lets move onto the environmental gains on venta x two how were those accomplished\nbut a rdr a must have purified the polluted water and air\ndid she not even pick up one piece of trash\nforgive me but it sounds as if with a great deal of hard work and courage your ancestors changed this world all by themselves\nno further questions\ni believe my associate mister laforge may be bringing the answer to that question i request a recess\nmister laforge my reputation as a litigator not to mention my immortal soul is in serious jeopardy\nhave you identified the source of her power\nshe has a romulan cloaking device\nthe enterprise\ncan you make contact\nthis is what i want to do but we have less than an hour\njared your e a wise and experienced leader and i assume you trust your senses\nand all your senses tell you that this woman here is the most powerful force on this planet dont they\nthen what would you say if i were to tell you that she has no powers whatsoever\noh yes a rdr as magic jared would you believe me if i told you that i could steal her powers and perform the same magical acts as she\nnot hats true im not a rdr a but i can create tremors just as she did\nof course ar dra will you would do the honours and stop the tremors\nis something the matter\nwell i dont\nyou recognise the old bag of tricks what about this one come back ar dra if you can no fine allow me\nimpudence\nyour honour i appreciate your indulgence allow me to explain a team from the enterprise has taken control of this womans ship now in orbit around venta x two thankyou for your help number one\nthey have been monitoring me on my communicator executing a prearranged programme on her ships computer a fairly ingenious combination of force field projection holography and transporter effects a rdr a controls her magic literally by the blink of an eye centuries old technology an implant which permits the movements of her eye to choose and activate each illusion a rdr a once told us that she is known by many names well at least in that she was being honest her crew has admitted that she is known by twenty three aliases in this sector alone\ndeceiving innocent people with her petty schemes for years venta x two must have offered her the greatest opportunity of her nefarious careers he learned of the myth of a rdr a studied it and expertly played on your fears that your people were ready to virtually surrender to her\nno jared as ive tried to tell you you saved your own lives a long time

before we were all knocked unconscious by the wormhole you said we were unconscious for thirty seconds\nthen why do these show a full days growth\neach of these incubators was set with spores from completely different sources in the dio median system i have a dozen more in the lab perhaps something extraordinary happened to one of them but not to all of them\njean luci m telling you this is over twenty four hours of growth captains log supplemental commander data continues to maintain that we were unconscious for only thirty seconds despite doctor crushers evidence to the contrary\ncaptain\nif we never went through that wormhole then what happened to us during that day\na transporter trace analysis might give us another indication of how much time has actually passed\nhello chief hows the elbow\nno its not tell me do you remember the last person to use the transporter before we went through the wormhole\ntell her to report to sickbay

thank you ensign locklin that ll be all for now\ncrusher to captain picard\ni need to see you immediately\nphysiologically each of us is on a daily cycle our cells have developed rhythms based on a twenty four hour period\nexactly and i can measure that effect at the molecular level i took a trace from the last person to use the transporter before the incident and compared her cell function

however the stars single planet falls within them class range it is capable of supporting life\nhighly sir\naye sir\nsensors indicate an energy fluctuation directly in our path source unknown\nvery likely small and extremely unstable wormholes have been mapped near thirty nine t tauri systems in the last one hundred years alone sir\ncaptain\ncaptain\ncareful captain the stun effect from the wormhole was relatively severe\napproximately thirty seconds i have scanned the entire ship and detected no life threatening injuries among the crew\nno sir my positronic system is immune to the effect this is the third unstable wormhole i have passed through during my time with starfleet the first was aboard the trieste\nsiri should realign the ships clock with starbase four tens subspace signal to adjust for the time distortion\nyes captain\nthat was never actually a possibility the wormholes small size and relatively short period would make this a local phenomenon\nthe unpredictability of the wormhole would make an investigation a hazardous one a probe launched from our current position would be more advisable\ncoming in now sir the probe is within visual range of the planet\nsensors indicate a hydrogen helium composition with a frozen helium core\nit is possible the sensors were affected by interference from the wormhole commander it is clearly not a class m planet\naye sir\nit is conceivable that the sensors picked up the afterimage of an actual planet on the other side of the wormhole we could survey the nearby stars for such a planet it would require approximately six days sir\ncaptain i have a hypothesis the twenty second century physicist pell underhill conjectured that a major disruption in time continuity could be compensated for by trillions of counter reactions that effect may have allowed doctor crushers mosses to arrive at the other side of the wormhole with the unanticipated growth\ntrue nevertheless it is possible that the phenomenon could occur in matter at much higher levels of organisation given the proper conditions\nas you wish captain\nthe long range and infrared sensors apparently suffered ill effects as a result of the wormhole we are presently checking neutrino and heavy particle detectors\nit is a mystery captain\ni am unable to answer that question sir\nas you wish captain\ni know the way sir captains log supplemental it has become clear that everyone aboard the enterprise has lost an entire day as the mystery of what actually occurred during those missing hours continues to deepen sodomy doubts about

shape and strength as rapidly as possible maximum shields will only speed the ships take over\nthe energy field will eventually penetrate our shields there is no way to counter the pax ans technology we can delay their takeover but we can not prevent it\nyou will only harm counsellor trois body\nthey are xenophobe s sir isolationists the pax ans terra formed a proto planet in this system in order to better conceal their whereabouts the apparent wormhole we experienced is actually a trap designed to keep out invaders the energy field stuns everyone onboard the invading vessel and places them in a state of biochemical stasis\nthe pax ans then take the ship out of their territory\nprecisely\nmy positronic brain is a technology unknown to the pax ans\nwhen i realised the crew was incapacitated i initiated emergency procedures data\ncomputer begin random fluctuation of shield frequency and modulation\nwith the enterprise temporarily protected i revived the crew\ncomputer release compound

tampering\ngentlemen how goes the battle\ngreat ill take over now data the captain wants you back on the bridge see you later in ten forward\nnelson i need your help with the computer\nive got some good news and some bad news the good news is that we were right about the computers chronometer theresa security programme to prevent tampering but it looks now like it was disabled and a new

damnit i couldnt get the license plate\nits all right madeline ill take it in here\nyes what is it\ni appreciate your concern commander data what can i do for you\nwell theres nothing unusual about

to investigate you are very welcome to carry on if you like\na wormhole\nagreed number one ensign take usa course\ndata\napparently so how long were we unconscious\nyou were not affected\nthank you mister data well where the hell are we\nproceed\ngo ahead doctor\nthe enterprise just jumped through a wormhole\napparently we were all unconscious for about thirty seconds\ntheres little or no damage on the bridge doctor\nships status\ncounsellor are you all right\nwell not too bad all things considered\ntheres still the anomalous m class planet we were going to investigate do we go back\nmake it so\nreadings data\non screen\nmister data run a full diagnostic to make sure the wormhole didnt permanently damage the sensors\nensign take us back on a course\nproblem number one\nno no we dont have time for that weve encountered a minor mystery one that has been solved to my satisfaction number one unless theres a major objection then ensign mcknight should put us back on course for evadne four\nensign\ncome\na minor mystery that seems to be a recurring phrase these days oh dio median scarlet moss i didnt know you were an enth no botanist\nyou ve got a good crop here as i recall its not easy to cultivate\ncorrect\nperhaps you ve got some sort of fast growth strain\ndoctor we were not unconscious for a full day everything on board indicates that we were out for thirty seconds the ships chronometer the computer everything doctor including commander data\nthank you data an intriguing hypothesis well perhaps we ve got a tempest in a test tube after all\ndata i promised mister nelson that you would assist him with the sensor diagnostic you ll find him hard at work on deck thirtysix\ndo you believe him i want a frank answer commander\nim not sure mister worf i have never known data to tell a lie and yet\nit could be that whatever caused this situation also affected data and it could be that he stelling the truth and that this is all just a minor mystery\ndoctor commander make it so meanwhile we will maintain our present course if there is something wrong with data we dont want him to be aware of our suspicions\nwhat is it doctor\nim on my way to engineering join me\nthe internal clock\nand were they\nif thats the good news whats the bad news\nthat is an understatement data is it possible that someone or something could have affected you without your knowing\ndata would you consent to being examined by commander laforge\nwill you escort commander data to engineering\nand\ni was almost hoping that you d find a problem\nthis entire mystery started when our sensors detected that planet first it was class m now it isnt\ndata launched that probe\nwhat happened to us in that missing day surely there must be some clues each of us should try and think what we were doing just before we blacked out reenact it if you have to\ndeanna are you all right\nperhaps sickbay would be a better idea\nwill you see the counsellor to her quarters\nis she all right\nwhat happened deanna\ngo ahead geordi\nim on my way\ndo you recognize this planet data\nstrange that an obscure planet several hundred light years from here should be picked up by the probe data did you take this image from the ships library and programme the probe to send it back to us\nbut you dont deny it\nmister laforge will you send another probe to the tta uri system\ncounsellor troi just had a very disturbing hallucination\nfor the moment can you tell me if deanna s incident is related in any way to this missing time period\ndata your e the key to this entire mystery and youve done nothing but block my every attempt to solve it why are you fighting me\nwhat do you mean by that\nwould you rather endanger deanna a friend and a colleague than tell me what is going on\nare you saying that by not cooperating you are actually protecting us\nthen mister data im going to ask you again and i order you to directly answer me what really happened to us\nwhat would you have me do data how would you handle this if our positions were reversed\ndo you know what a court martial would mean your career in starfleet would be finished\ndo you also realise that you would most likely be stripped down to your wires to find out what the hell has gone wrong\nduring the missing day\nare you suggesting he was conscious\nand our memories of that day\nby whom\ni cant accept that explanation\ngranted but im beginning to suspect that commander data is refusing to cooperate because he believes he is acting in the best interests of the enterprise\ngo ahead geordi\nacknowledged maybe now well get some answers\nwhat do you have mister laforge\nthe same planet our sensors picked up before the so called wormhole\nthats because there is no a wormhole there never was\nit was a ruse designed to throw us off the track look at the clues doctor crushers incubation experiment the computer clock the transporter trace all indicate the existence of a missing day lieutenant worf s broken wrist would seem to suggest that we were awake and aware for that day possibly in a struggle for our lives\nnot necessarily doctor data s behaviour would seem to suggest we did not why else would he be willing to sacrifice his career rather than tell the truth\nthen the only alternative would be a stalemate may be a compromise might have been reached a compromise that forced data into this silence\npossibly number one and i would be prepared to live with the mystery but data s role in this must be ascertained or hell never be trusted with starship duty again ensign take us back to the scene of the crime the t tauri system warp two\ndrop to impulse ensign mister worf maximum shields ready all weapons\non screen hold position lets see what it does\nlets see what happens when it hits the shields\nwell data as you can see were back where it all started\nwhy\nwhy what is the source of that risk the energy field\ndata you sound as if youre stuck in a feedback loop you certainly can say you have free will you have a choice\nnot by choice are you somehow being controlled by that force did geordi miss something when he examined you\nthen why are you compelled to disobey my order show during the missing day were you contacted by starfleet did they order you to conceal the truth from us\nthis ship isnt going anywhere not until i get an answer now who gave you that order\ni ordered you to lie\ndo as data says at once\nthe pax ans who are they\nnow orf\nwe are not invaders we are explorers\nwhat went wrong this time\nstatus data\noptions mister worf\ncan we go to warp\nno stop everyone who are you\nif you destroy this ship then others will come in search of us you may not be able to stop them all knowledge of your civilisation would be spread across half the galaxy\nallow us safe passage and i will protect your right to privacy to the best of my ability we will never tell anyone of your existence\nthis biochemical stasis does it suppress synaptic functions\nthen you must have the capability of affecting memory can you erase the short term memory of everyone on this ship remove all knowledge of this event allow us to proceed as if it had never happened\ndata im going to give you a most unusual order im not sure that you will be able to integrate it into your programme\ngood because our survival depends upon it iam ordering you never to reveal what has happened here today not to starfleet not to myself you will conceal your knowledge of the pax ans for as long as you exist do you fully understood data\nsatisfactory\ngoodnow our task is to eliminate from the ships records any information that might lead to knowledge of this incident lets get to work\nhere we are again\nnowait the plan failed because clues were left behind that suggested a mystery and to many humans a mystery is irresistible it must be solved the doctors incubation experiment worf s wrist trois hallucinations little pieces of evidence that suggested even more clues the clock the transporter trace data s odd behaviour if we eliminate the clues and begin again\nyes consider the first time a run through a rehearsal to shake out the flaws the second time will succeed if we leave no clues\nwelcome back counsellor geordi data reconfigure the computer and the records number one i want you to oversee the rest of the ship and this time lets get it right\nwhat happened data\nso it would seem\nhow long were we out\nit could be worse\nthe enterprise went through a wormhole doctor it seems the entire crew was unconscious for approximately thirty seconds\napparently not\nstatus reports\ncounsellor\nwell then there s still that anomalous class m planet we were going to investigate ensign replot a course to take us back to\nmake it so and put

galaxy in the middle of next week\nwait a minute didnt your readings indicate a class m planet before we passed through the wormhole data\ncaptain\nit seems awfully strange that a malfunctioning

mister jakar a\ni know how it sounds im not anxious to make a fool of myself this new era of space flight it fires the imagination people see unidentified vessels in the sky that turn out to be weather balloons\nour medical journals have documented several cases of genetic mutation in recent history some unusual physical dis figurations have occurred\nperhaps but you mister ja kara are hiding something and unless you tell me the truth about yourself this rumour will persist and grow and could even become dangerous most especially to you\nstop it all of you stop it now have you all lost your minds\nget him into a surgical cubicle and call central security this has gone too far\ni didnt think he would have survived the injuries\nat least give him time to regain some strength come back tomorrow\nthose drugs increase car dial rate and vascular pressure thats the last thing we need to do to him right now\nim just a physician minister i dont know much about affairs of state but he

speak together without distraction\nnot a word to anyone about this mi rasta\nwe have something very much like this here on malc or three\nand much that is not in common\nyou speak the language of diplomacy very well captain it is a language i appreciate and understand but i have learned to not always trust it\nmy worlds history has recorded that conquerors often arrived with the words we are your friends\nwhat do you want\nand if my wishes should conflict with yours\nand if i should tell you to leave and never return to my world\ni can infer from that directive that you do not intend to share all this exceptional technology with us\nis this your way of maintaining superiority\nyour e right of course im overwhelmed captain picard im quite overwhelmed i go home each night to a loving wife two beautiful daughters we eat the evening meal together as a family i think thats important and they always ask me i five had a good day\ni will have to say this morning i was the leader of the

rasta\nwhat else do you know mi rasta everything\nwhere is this commander riker now\nyou are punctual captain\ndo you i think you know a great deal more about me than i know about you\nyou speak of trust and peace and working together to enter a new era and at the same time you conduct secret surveillance posing as malc orians\ncommander riker\nyes shes tried to accept the responsibility\ni can appreciate the logic of your position captain but it would seem a full disclosure after contact would have been in order\nyes a mistake i might have made in your place i rather like it actually\nthat you make mistakes like any man\nwell talk again later captain\nif i did not depend so much on your expertise in space matters i would have asked for your resignation\nwhen you are selected to occupy this office then you will have the privilege of deciding the best interests of our people picardi can excuse but you mi rasta you should have trusted me\ni cant afford to be the idealist you are mi rasta\ni am prepared to release riker after we have interrogated him\nkrol a\nthey were struggling for the weapon\nyour e aboard the starship my foolish old friend\ni know i know\nmi rasta it goes against every instinct in my being my people are not ready to accept what you represent everything that happened in the hospital proves it and kro la is the best evidence of all we must slow down and allow all those like him to join us in the present before we can move into the future\nthe warp programme will have to be delayed we will divert more resources to education and social development to prepare for the day when we are ready\ni know captain you once said if i ask you to leave you would without hesitation im afraid i must ask you to do just that\nwere a good people captain a society with much potential once we cross the threshold of space we will have to give up this self importance this conceit that we are the centre of the universe but this is not the time for that for now we will have to enjoy that sweet innocence\nthe stories will be told for many years i have no doubt of the ship that made contact of an alien who was held prisoner in the medical facility there ll be charges of a government conspiracy some of the witnesses will tell their tales and most people will laugh at them and go back and watch more interesting fiction of the daily broadcasts it will

pull us further from our traditional ways\nthe people were willing to accept your social reforms because they believe in you chancellor but there are many who say we have gone far enough all these new ideas new technology and now space travel it confuses them frightens them\nyou can not possibly be suggesting surrender chancellor\nmi rasta you are incredibly naive can you be so enraptured with the notion of space travellers that you are blind to the threat they represent\nwhy should they use force when we are ready to lay down in fear\nchancellor i mean no disrespect but i have repeatedly warned you about your policies taking us so quickly where we had no business going in the first place new philosophies new economics new technologies there are many people who still value our traditional way of life and if or one am willing to die to defend it\nyou would ignore them as they infiltrate and spy on us\nwe have captured one of their spies\nyears imagine what they have done influenced our young stirred up dissent\nhes in the sik la medical facility hes recovering from surgery he suffered head injuries in an escape attempt he will recover consciousness in a few hours\nwill he survive\ni have to interrogate him before he dies\nit can not wait until tomorrow\nwere not giving him back hes the one advantage we have now use your drugs to revive him\nrevive

questions\nyou have lied since the moment of your capture and i believe you are lying now commander\nsuch noble creatures why do peaceful people develop such lethal weapons or do you still insist its just a toy\nan interesting toy to be sure\nperhaps like many conquerors you believe your goals to be benevolent i can not for however you would describe your intentions you still represent the end to my way of life i can not permit that to occur eventually dur ken would choose to welcome your people with arms open and eyes closed i must force him down another path\nwhen they find us i will be dead killed by your weapon the lines will be drawn a peaceful accord will no longer be an option\nfor my people\nwhere is this\nno chancellor you must not you must not pursue relations with them you must not\nthere are guards out there youll never escape that way im not afraid of you\nwe shouldnt fear the unknown we should embrace it\nare you really an alien its all right to tell me\ni dont believe you you are an alien\ni could divert the guards attention you might stand a chance if you took the service exit down the hallway to the right\nwhy should i\ni believe you\nif you make love to me\nive always wanted to make love with an alien\nlane l\noh its not so much to ask and then ill help you escape\ni cant wait to learn\nits your only way out of here my alien\nsome things happened to him i

i was a child my parents would take me to the planetarium and we would sit in the dark and it was as if i was on a spaceship on my way to another world to meet people on other planets part of me keeps waiting for the lights to come up and the programme to end how did you know about me\ni hate to think how you would judge us based on our popular music and entertainment\nyouve had people on our planet\nyou dont have to explain i understand although not everybody on my planet would they would think you were trying to infiltrate our society\nof course where was rikers last known location\nwe must find him before someone realises what he really is if this gets out prematurely it could seriously complicate matters our ideology is based on the assumption that the mal corian is a supreme life form and our world is the centre of the universe your arrival will change our entire understanding of life and some will not want it to change\ndur ken he will be open minded but cautious i strongly suggest that you do not discuss your surveillance teams with him at least not right away\ncaptain picardi must ask you to trust me on this if you tell the chancellor about commander riker you will undermine everything that you hope to accomplish here dur ken will assign krol a our minister of security to find him krol a has his own political agenda he will perceive you as the greatest threat that our people have ever known and he will not hesitate to use riker to prove that he is correct\nchancellor i think you might want to clear your afternoon schedule for this\nchancellor\nhe san android chancellor a constructed being\nchancellor with your permission i would like to be am to the surface i have several matters to attend to\nof course\nhas there still been no communication from commander riker data\nthey are not hostile\nopen your eyes krol a we are part of a greater community we can not ignore it\nchancellor he is captain pi cards first officer commander riker\nhe has been missing for two days i told captain picard not to discuss this because i was afraid this is exactly what would happen\nthey have been on our planet observing for several years\nthey were collecting information\nkrol a we can get help from his ship with their medical technology he might recover\nit will probably be enough to kill him you cant do it\nthankyou for seeing me\ni felt i was acting in the best interests of our people chancellor\nchancellor we must release riker to picard any hope for a relationship with these people depends on it\nriker\nare you prepared for him to die chancellor his injuries are extremely serious a mob at the medical facility almost killed him krol a has ordered drugs to be used to revive him for questioning drugs that in his condition would be dangerous for him without medical aid from his ship i believe that riker will not survive the day you must tell picard where he is\nstun\nkro la was trying to be a martyr\nbut chancellor\nbut when we encounter other beings in space our people must be ready\nchancellor i strongly disagree\nim sorry to say he s probably right captain picardi have one last request take me with you\ni have been prepared for the realities of space since i was nine years old and sitting in a planetarium\nreadings\ni cant find his car dial organ\nthere it is up here\never seen anything like this\nyou think thats something look at this\nhe has digits on his terminus\nyou want us to believe that all your abnormalities are inherited genetic traits\ngenetic irregularities that thing isnt even the same species as we are\nits all the space flights they have attracted creatures from outer space\ni think we ought to call central security\nwhat if there re more of them they could be everywhere\nit doesnt make sense that hes the only one think about it\nstop him somebody stop him\nhe shot him the aliens hot krol a\ni have a circulation pattern its very weak we have to get him on vital buffers right now crusher\nwith that

ale\nmy name is jean luc picard this is my associate dean nat roi\nabout space about the universe you are preparing to enter\nwe ve been monitoring your progress toward warp drive capability when a society reaches your level of technology and is clearly about to initiate warp travel we feel the time is right for first contact we prefer meeting like this rather than a random confrontation in deep space\nwe almost always encounter shock and fear on this sort of mission we hope that you will help us facilitate our introduction\nits certainly no joke as you can see we are physically quite different from malc orians and with your permission im prepared to prove it to you\npicard to enterprise three to beam up\nwe learn as much as possible about a planet before we make first contact\nindeed we do get an incomplete picture which is why we also do surface reconnaissance\nthese are specialists highly trained observation teams superficially identical to yourselves and therefore able to blend naturally into your society you see we have discovered that the most hazardous aspect of these missions is a lack of sufficient information\nthere is a difficulty here one that has forced us to accelerate this entire process one of our people is missing my first officer commander william riker he was down on the planet surface coordinating with the observation team the final details of contact he disappeared my people have made enquiries but they ve not been able to locate him if there is anything you can help\nwhat about dur ken\nbut with the disappearance of commander riker wouldnt it be prudent\nand this is the bridge\nhere we have environmental and engineering stations mission operations and the two principal science stations\ndata allow me to introduce chancellor avel dur ken and space administrator mira stay ale\ncommander data is my second officer\ncertainly\nmister data will you escort the minister to the transporter room chancellor\nive been saving this for a special occasion my brother on earth produces fruit known as grapes which he turns into wine hes really quite good at it chancellor we have a tradition called a toast it is a drink to salute ones friends and good fortune and i would like to propose a toast to a new friendship\ni think we shall find we have much in common\nan opportunity to learn from one another\ntrust requires time and experience\nwe are not here as conquerors chancellor\na beginning but how we proceed is entirely up to you\nthere ll be no conflict\nwe will leave and never return chancellor we are here only to help guide you into a new era i can assure you we will not interfere in the natural development of your planet that is in fact our prime directive\nthat is not the whole meaning but it is part of it\nchancellor to instantly transform a society with technology would be harmful and it would be destructive\nand how shall you answer them tonight chancellor\nchancellor\ni know how busy you are\nin what respect\ncommander riker\nmi rasta said it would be a mistake to discuss this with you\nit was my error n others chancellor there is no starship mission more dangerous than that of first contact we never know what we will face when we open the door on a new world how we will be greeted what exactly the dangers will be centuries ago a disastrous contact with the klingon empire led to decades of war it was decided then we would do surveillance before making contact it was a controversial decision i believe it prevented more problems than it created\nin time there would have been full disclosure i can only ask you to believe that on other worlds it would not be an issue but here everything our observers reported indicated that the people of this world would almost certainly react negatively to our arrival we could see that even surveillance might even be interpreted as an act of aggression i hoped that we would have found commander riker before you did so the matter would not complicate our introduction it was a mistake\nlike it\nchancellor i have made some fine ones in my time now i must ask you will you release my officer\nenterprise one to beam up\ngo ahead doctor\nacknowledged\nwell meet you on the enterprise picard out\nits a defensive weapon have you been able to ascertain what happened\nwell its your decision chancellor but i must say i regret that i wont have the opportunity of knowing your people better\nhow will you keep us a secret when so many have seen and heard so much\nwe may not be back here in your lifetime and i have to believe that you

gave it personality but when it came to the relationship laforge you filled in the blanks and you had a perfectly wonderful marvellous little fantasy until the real leah showed up and ruined it shes probably done the most horrific thing one person can do to another not live up to your expectations so id take a good hard long look at her laforge see her for who she is not for what you want her to

not everyday a man comes face to face with his dream\nyou remember about a year ago when we were caught in that booby trap the mentha rss et okay while we were trying to get out of it i went down to the holodeck to study an engine prototype that was made when the enterprise was first designed and the computer well it gave me an image of the engine but it also created this hologram of the designer doctor leah brahms\nyeah but not an ordinary computer simulated female i mean she was brilliant of course but warm you know friendly it was like we worked as one i would start a sentences shed finish it what i didnt think of she did it was just so comfortable okay i know it was just a holographic image but the computer was able to incorporate personality traits from her starfleet record\nno no

okay\nyou remember the crystals been reoriented to adjust the direction of the lattice structure\nright why would you well the ship was experiencing some difficulty and we made this adjustment hoping that it would work and it did\nnot exclusively no\nin the next class starship\ni didnt i mean well its the next logical step right listen doctor sometimes we have to fly by the seat of our pants out here so it stands to reason that once in a while were going to come up with the same solutions you do listen ive got a personnel review scheduled to start in about five minutes and i know its been a long day for you so why dont we get together later sort of plan our agenda for the next day or two\nwhat it is we want to accomplish here how we might best go about that maybe even get to know each

than this moremore a little more hold right there perfect now some music may be a little soft jazz no thats not right let me think here oh i got it some brahms a piano etude nah thats too corny probably everybody thinks of that computer just give me some guitar classical guitar doesnt matter who yes thank you\ncome on in\nyeah the uniforms are so formal\nam ii really just wanted to make you feel more comfortable\nim sorry come in and have a seat can i get you a drink\nyou sure you know your hair its different\nno i mean its different than i expected different from your starfleet records\nyeah\nstandard procedure when guests come on board protocol i mean it was nothing specific actually just you know\noh i know\nbut they re wrong i assure you\nits like they re your children\nso naturally your e a little possessive about them\nyes i do you see i feel the same way\nwell maybe you just havent met the right people you hungry im hungry why dont i just start dinner okay\nplease call me geordi\nyou cant\noh\nsure fine\ngoodnight\ngood morning\nyou realise the only way to inspect them is to crawl inside\nhere we go power taps watch yourself\nyour e probably the only other person in the galaxy who could pick that up\nits right up here\nits a midrange phase adjuster puts the plasma back into phase after inertial distortion\nuhuh doctor no writing is not one of

work\nand well i really i really wanted to meet you for a long time and id like to think that we could become friends may be good friends\nhow could it have been so far off it was based on every piece

right look ever since you came on board you ve been badgering mean dive take nitive shown you courtesy and respect and a hell of a lot of patience oh no no no wait a minute ive tried to understand you ive tried to get along with you and in return youve accused tried and convicted me without bothering to hear my side of it so im guilty okay but not of what you think of something much worse im guilty of reaching out to you of hoping we could connect im guilty of a terrible crime doctor i offered you friendship\nready captain\ni am deactivating the atmospheric force field now\nsorry captain\nthe

this is a spacebaby right i mean these creatures are born live and die in interstellar space\nokay all matter in space vibrates in a specific radiation band\nit might just give us enough to pour a

fine thank you\nno thank you\ndifferent than a few hours ago\noh yes i used to wear it up\nwhy would you need to see my personnel file\ncommander laforge if i seem to be somewhat unyielding in my views its because i care so very much about my work\nto be honest people find me cold cerebral lacking in humour\nwell i try not to be that way but when it comes to my designs my engines especially the ones on the enterprise\nyes exactly\nyou understand that\nthats amazing i dont think anyone has ever sometimes i feel more comfortable with engine schematics than people\ncommander\nim sorry i hope that i didnt put you to a lot of trouble but i cant stay\ni just dont think that its appropriate\nill meet with you at oh eight hundred tomorrow im preparing a list of discrepancies that ive identified in your modifications i hope now that weve reached an understanding that you ll be prepared to discuss them with me in a more objective fashion\nthank you goodnight commander\ngood morning\nthe first thing id like to do is inspect the power transfer conduits\ni designed them commander i know whats involved\nthe acoustic signature doesnt sound right\nwhats causing it\nive never seen anything like this before what is it\nthis has never been done before i dont even think this has ever been conceived of before you should write a scientific paper\nbut this kind of refinement should be shared and you deserve the credit for it\ncommander laforge ever since i came on board there seems to be something a little peculiar about your attitude you seem to know things about me even though weve never met\nwell im flattered but\ni thought you knew i mean you know everything else about me but commander if im hearing what i think im hearing then you should know that im married\nwe

commander for constructing a programme which contained the prototype engine so that you would always have a baseline reference for your modifications and now i find that its all about a fantasy plaything\nim outraged by this i have been invaded violated how dare you use me like this how far did it go anyway was it good for you\noh i can tell everytime you retouching the engine you retouching me real professional\nhow do i know how far it went how many other programs did you create perhaps dozens of them one for every day of the week one for every mood\ncommander i have a thought if youre interested\nif the baby is nursing perhaps what we need is to find a way to sour the milk if we could contaminate the energy hes feeding on we could try to\nand how do we modify them without losing life support\nwhat\napparently\ntwenty one centimetres thats good commander thats very good if we could alter the power frequency so that its completely foreign to the life forms natural

    "episode 89": "the entire bridge crew\nwere almost finished with the autopsies captain\nits complicated the dead were found all over the ship some were found locked in their rooms barricaded with weapons piled all around them others were found in the corridors where they d obviously had hand to hand combat its going to take some time to analyse and sort through the details weve identified him as andrus hagan from beta zed scientific advisor hes in a profound catatonic state\nive been studying the autopsy reports the conclusion is appalling there was no outside source no alien presence all thirtyfour of them appear to have killed each other\ntoxicological tests showed no unusual substances in their systems and they all appear to be in good health but for whatever reason they seemed to turn against each other using phasers and knives and bare hands id like you to see this captain its from the logs of the brittain captain za he vas mental condition deteriorated steadily once they d became stranded she began talking of plots and mutinies this was the last entry log made after they had been adrift for over three weeks\ncaptain do you have a moment\nin some cases in others just erratic behaviour\nyes captain we have to get the enterprise away from here before it gets any worse\na what\ndata int y kens experience did the crew exhibit behavioural changes\nthen what is it whats happening to us\nid like to do more cross sections on the brain tissue of some of these bodies set up the positron emission sensor in sickbay and ill decide which ones i want to study\ngo away\ncaptain let me ask you this since we located the brittain can you remember any of your dreams\nmost people dont but think have you even had a dream in the last ten days\nim willing to bet you havent whats more neither has anyone else on board this ship except for troi i began to realise that when she talked about having nightmares ive done some additional brain tissue tests one r bodies some of the bodies from the er the\nright and ive also done some scans on a random cross section from our crew they both have the same results a unique chemical imbalance\ndream deprivation every night when we enter into sleep\nwe have to dream in order to survive if we dont reach rem sleep we dont dream we begin to lose our cognitive abilities we find it hard to concentrate we forget how to do the most ordinary task then we become irritable paranoid some people experience hallucinations\nmaybe its because she s beta zoid i dont know why all i know is theres more going on here than being caught in a tyke ns rift and i dont know how or why its happening but i do know this there is an inevitable conclusion to this pattern and if i cant find a way to stop it we will all go insane\ndeanna no things work in give tried somatic drugs ive tried inducing theta waves into the entorhinal cortex no matter what i do no one can reach sleep no one can dream except for you\nwhat\nis there a way we could block their signals\ni can help keep you in sleep for awhile with this cortical scanner it will maintain electrical activity in your brain at the proper frequency\nsignals steady visual cortex showing increased activity rapid eye movements commencing crusher to bridge\nshes in sleep\nthe ship is intact sir with no indication of structural damage\nall propulsion systems are shut down the

there is no engine activity at all sir\nis there a problem ensign\nready now captain\ncaptain thrusters are losing power\nno sir apparently we do not\nafter analysing the sensor logs of the brittain and the enterprise as well as the data from the last series of probes i conclude that we have become trapped in a massive rupture in space into which energy is absorbed\na rare anomaly named after be lat y kent hemel thus ian captain who first encounter edit\nthe ships energy is being drained into the fissure before we can utilise it\nwhen ty ken was trapped in the rift his analysis determined that a massive energy release might overload and dislocate the anomaly fortunately his cargo included a nici um and yuri um which he used to detonate the explosion he then escaped through the ruptured centre of the rift\nno sir we no longer have the power to reproduce complex elements in the replicator we must find a way to generate a violent energy release without using conventional means\nno there were no reports of unusual conduct among the crew\nthere were no records of sleep disturbances of any kind counsellor\ncommander laforge and i have come up with a potential solution to our predicament perhaps the modifications used to increase firepower against the borg could be effective here\nyes sir i believe that within six hours we could generate a concentrated burst of energy which might disrupt the tyke ns rift\nyes sir\nyes sir\ni will do my best sir\nthe brittain doctor\ni believe the doctor means is that humans enter what is known as rem sleep rapid eye movement it is the level of brainwave activity at which one dreams\nthe main deflector dish\ndata to bridge mister worf activate the deflector\ncaptain it appears the energy output\nhas been absorbed into the rift\nno sir if we draw\nmore power we risk losing life support systems\nit is possible that this telepathic communication is creating interference in the sleep of other species that would explain why the rest of our crew is not dreaming\nyour hypothesis is certainly plausible there may be another ship on the other side of the fissure where we can not detect it\nthere is no technology to block telepathic transmissions doctor\nperhaps we can accomplish more than that if there is another ship and we can reach them we might be able to coordinate our efforts to free ourselves\nworking together with the aliens we must discover a means by which we an produce an explosion more intense than either one of us could achieve alone\nthese are the elements we have available some of them could be used in the creation of an explosive reaction if we could communicate this inventory to the other ship perhaps they would be able to\ni am uncertain if a simple transmission will be adequate\nyes counsellor one electron circles one proton this is a hydrogen atom\nperhaps the aliens are thinking as we are to collaborate in producing an explosion if hydrogen is combined with another element calend e nium for example it is extremely volatile but would the message mean they have hydrogen or they want hydrogen\nthen the proper course of action would be to release hydrogen into the rift and hope that they have a substance that will detonate it\nif you are correct counsellor i believe they have already told us what to do and are waiting for us to do it when we are ready the only message you should attempt to convey is now\ncounsellor data\nunfortunately yes\nwe have only enough power to emit a hydrogen stream for that amount of time they must understand that they will have to

for beta zoids than other humanoids i believe the beings are using that frequency to communicate telepathically\nthey recalling for help i think they re trapped just like we are eyes in the dark could mean this twinstar system\nmay be communication through dreams can work both ways i could try to get them to stop\nit is conceivable when working with patients with debilitating nightmares ive often used a therapeutic treatment called directed dreaming dreamers can learn to control of their dreams retain a conscious memory even while in rem sleep i could remember a short message and deliver it to

very small one if our scans havent found it\nhow did it get there\ntheres not much of her original left\ncommander lei j ten you said that before b revelle deserted starbase one one two last week hed been ill for several days what about mendez\nthe original t arch annen disappearances were never solved were they\nslow to impulse power mister worf\nhail the vessel\nput a repeating message on all subspace channels order the lieutenant to come about and stand to make it a priority one communiqu\non screen\nhow soon mister data\noptions\nopen a channel\nlieutenant hickman listen carefully this is captain picard of the enterprise you are in danger you must slow your rate of approach\nlieutenant hickman you must do what i tell you reduce your velocity and bring your craft to a positive pitch of twenty degrees now\nnumber one prepare your away team\nyour devotion to duty is admirable commander but doctor crusher is right you will remain on the enterprise until we know whether or not this is connected to the disappearance of the others\nwe have completed our survey on the surface analysing that data will keep us busy for awhile\nwhat about laforge\nthats what the reports said about mendez and hickman before they disappeared\ntheyre almost identical how do you explain that\nis the enterprise at risk\nmister laforge what if you begin to change what if you feel compelled to go down to the planet like the others\nvery well mister laforge you proceed with your investigation but i want you to report to doctor crusher for a bios can at the start of daywatch\ngo ahead doctor\nvery well doctor keep us informed\ncomputer what was the last known location of commander laforge\nre engage now\nour sensor array is useless we must find some other way of locating him\nmake it so number one as soon as data is ready i want you to lead an away team\nis there no hope for b revelle or mendez\nwelcome back mister laforge\nthen we will leave them be ill order warning beacons placed in orbit and on the surface hopefully no one else will have to go through what you did\nand hickman\nand five years later the away team that was investigating their disappearances have started to disappear themselves\ncommander laforge commander lei j ten report to the bridge we have a fix on the missing shuttle\nif he stays at that speed hell self destruct\nhes panicking\nworf data geordi\ncommander\ncommander lei j ten geordi check out the shuttle data worf you ve got the perimeter\nriker to susanna report fan outlets find her\nany luck\nnegative theres no indication that hes left the ship\ngeordi s uniform\ncan you modify an emergency beacon to operate on uv\naye sir\nhow long data\ngo ahead\nacknowledged he son foot couldnt have gotten too far lets assume a radius often kilometres\nwe ve got to narrow that down whats happening with the enhanced sensor arrays\nwe ve got to find a way to track him what about the high resolution em scans\ngeordi doesnt have several hours\nexcellent doctor crusher meet us in transporter room six immediately\nwhat about the ultraviolet\nyou up and running b revelle\nfreeze visual\nthats hickman on the right mendez on the left and as already noted the recording was made by ensign b revelle five years ago\nmendez was seen on the aries an hour before she disappeared according to witnesses she seemed completely normal\nhe just passed a routine physical on alia four with flying colours\ngeordi he was spotted by a federation supply ship yesterday on course tot arch annen three\nno we never learned what happened or why forty nine people gone\ngeordi andi are the only two left captains log stardate 446645weveseta course to intercept lieutenant hickman s stolen shuttlecraft and hopefully to discover the whereabouts of the other missing officers\nand then i almost married paul bo grow\nyou remember the one with the thin moustache\ni know\nwell i decided i had prejudged him unfairly and then i decided that id been right in the first place\nwhat about you\nthat doesnt sound like my little brother who always wanted advice on women\ni dont know but im not ashamed to tell you im a little scared you know\nwell if anybody s going to figure this out it ll be the le it jen and laforge show right\nwe always made a good team\nid like to volunteer to join you sir\nits the shuttle pod mendez stole from the aries\nover here\nmendez and b revelle are alive you saw the footprints\ntheyre here just standstill and listen you can feel it theyre here\nstay away\ndoi look as bad as i feel\nwhat happened\ni need to get back to the surface\ni have work to do\nim not going to stay locked up on this ship while the investigations going on\ncaptain\nyes sir i understand\nsure lets get going\ncaptain pi cards wrong the way to handle this is to get back down there with a dozen away teams fan out from the shuttle we could cover a lot of ground in a hurry use proximity detectors infrared sensors\noh geordi its started what if what happened to the others is happening to me\nsource\nif were pursuing a theory that somehow unknown aliens are involved i think i should tell you that we didnt find tracks like that during the original investigation\naliens or no aliens why would our people start returning after five years to be abducted\nsomething that happened while we were down there the first time\nlook for some commonality something we all touched may be a plant or the sand\nwere wasting our time\nyeah well i was wrong were not going to find anything this way we should go back to the planet its all down there everything we need to know\ni cant look at that anymore it hurts my eyes i cant think my brain feels like its wrapped up in a blanket\ni dont need a break i need to get off the ship\nforget crusher and forget your log starch anne ns down there geordi its waiting for us thats where we should go\ngeordi\ngeordi\nits inside of me geordi i cant fight it its winning\ni want to make another sweep of the perimeter laforge you start at building four mendez and b revelle begin at two ill take five\ndoctor crusher\nwhat did you do\nno no no its not a parasite doctor it was their method of reproduction to plant a strand in a living host that causes metamorphosis geordi hes gone\nhes gone back to the planet\nno but we have to find him\nyoull never be able to find him im the only one who can\nno you must turn them off the light frightens them\nthats beyond their visual spectrum they wont run away from it\nno hes here theyre all here\nthere\ngeordi stop\nnowait\ngeordi geordi my voice is familiar listen to it you can feel that we share this you know im not a threat the others mendez b revelle they dont exist as humans anymore but a part of you still does your e not one of them yet geordi i can help you if you ll just trust me i know whats going on inside of you the war your e fighting with yourself your humanity slipping away the instinct to run its overpowering but they know how to beat it now geordi look at me ive come back geordi let me take you back too just take my hand please\nwere going home geordi\nnone\nim right here geordi and so are doctor crusher and captain picard\nmust ve been because of all the good advice i used to give you\nlong range sensors holding on the shuttlecraft bearing zero one zero mark two seven one\nlieutenant hickman does not respond sir\nstill no response sir\nopen\ncaptain sensors detect two more federation shuttlecraft on the planet surface no life signs\nsiri am certain we are being watched\nall shuttles are secure\nyou search the structure i will take the perimeter\ncommander\ni do not read any life signs on the surface\nthat still leaves a search area of more than three hundred square kilometres\nall scans are still negative\nwe are adjusting sensors to read commander laforge s absorption spectrum but it will take several hours\nhe could be several kilometres away by now",

comfortable playing somebody else may be all this is not any better than escaping into a holodeck fantasy\nmay be your e right captains log stardate 447042 we have arrived at the argus array a remote

between forty five hundred and seven thousand angstroms\nnothing\nno no modulation\ncommander\nthanks for assigning me to this mission\ntheres still no modulation\nyou shouldnt have to wait too long

deflector and the shield grid using the warp field generator as a powerflow anti attenuator and that of course naturally created an amplification of the inherent energy output\ni dont agree we could repair all of the reactors simultaneously instead of one by one\nyes sir\nnot entirely the core memory is still intact and we could programme a completely new control system\ni could have it ready for you in two days\nif you could assist me in the morning commander\nthe moon yes that ll be my home my paradise is hall find there all the souls i love socrates galileo and when i arrive they will

through the arboretum the zal nias should be in bloom\ni dont need a counsellor what i need is the company of a charming intelligent woman\ngo ft over g naught\ni still dont see how your e going to incorporate quantum principle into general relativity without adjusting the cosmological constant a lot more than your e doing here\ni dont think i could deal with that\nif the semi set curved into the subatomic the infinities might cancel each other out\nim sorry commander thank you professor end programme\ni had some ideas late last night i needed to consult with the computer about some quantum electrodynamic calculations a holodeck einstein programme seemed like the best way i guess i went a little over board\nnot really i just havent thought along those lines before its all pretty evident now and if you were to put your mind to it im sure\nwhat because im beginning to behave like the rest of the crew with confidence in what im doing\nyes but\nyes ive finally become the person ive always wanted to be do we have to ask why\nprobably somewhere between twelve hundred and fourteen fifty\nthermal levels up one hundred seventy seven percent comparable increase in neutron emissions\nyes but our computer is too slow to direct the repairs the parameters are changing too quickly for it to keep up\nbrower increase the intake of liquid helium three into the reactor wall we ve got to cool it off\nunclear the interface isnt fast enough\ni cant do anything from here i have to find a better interface\ncomputer begin new programme create as follows workstation chair now create a standard alphanumeric console positioned for left hand now an iconic display console positioned for right hand tie both consoles into the enterprise main computer core utilising neural scan interface\nno problem here show you build it\na neural interface was created to expedite the repairs\ni am responding sir im sorry if i caused you any alarm it was necessary in order to secure the array\nyes commander its me\nim sorry captain i was only trying to help our computer was too slow to compensate for the overload on the array so i created an interface that communicated my thoughts directly to the central processing unit\nmy body is as you see it here but much of my higher brain functions and memory have been transferred to the starboard computer core\nim afraid i cant sir\nmy primary cerebral functions are now operating almost entirely from within the computer they have expanded to such a degree that it would be impossible to return to the confines of my human brain any attempt to do so would mean my death\ncommander laforge\ni thought you would be in your quarters\ni wish i could convey to you what its like for me now what ive become\ni can conceive almost infinite possibilities and can fully explore each of them in a nanosecond i perceive the universe as a single equation and it is so simple i understand\neverything\ni believe it is a gift that i have been chosen to fulfill a great purpose\ndo you suppose all of this has changed the way people think about me\nive been concerned about that but soon everyone will understand what i can do for humanity\nwe have always perceived the maximum speed of the enterprise as a function of warp but i know now there are no limits we will explore new worlds that we could never before have reached in our lifetime\ni will take us to them\nyes sir im altering subspace in away thats never been conceived of before im fairly certain it will allow us to travel half way across the galaxy in a matter of only\ncaptain if you d only allow me to show\ni really would rather not sir im positive that you ll be pleased with the result once ive finished showing\nhello deanna\nim sorry that we cant take that walk in the arboretum\nyoung children are sometimes frightened of the world that doesnt mean that their parents should let them stay in their cribs\ni can see so much more than you are capable of you should trust that dean naive always wanted to earn your respect\nyou must trust me\ntrust me\ncommander\nyour e too late\nyes commander riker\ni want you to know lieutenant worf that i understand your duty in this matter\nand that i in no way will take your actions personally\ni think i can help you with that captain\nthe cytheria ns have reintegrated me sir\nthe probe was designed to instruct outsiders on how to reach this system the technologies arent always compatible they failed with the argus computer and with the computer onboard the shuttle but they were able to re programme\nyour e both on the same mission captain\nyes sir the cytheria ns are exploring the galaxy just as we are the only difference is that they never leave their home they bring others here their only wish an exchange of knowledge they want to know us captains log stardate 447219 after ten days in the company of the cytheria ns the enterprise has been safely returned to federation space we bring back knowledge of their race that will take our scholars decades to examine lieutenant barclay is apparently no worse for his experience\ni remember doing everything i just dont remember how or why\nsmaller\nalways seems to come back to that doesnt it\ni think i know what your e saying\nsure\nyou really you really dont have to do that\nmay i checkmate in nine moves\ni dont back to the episode listing star trek and related

my workshop\nthere was enough energy in that flash to overload your optic nerves it knocked you unconscious\nexactly but there was no apparent retinal damage and the cornea looks fine but im still waiting for a full sero amino readout ill call you when it comes in id like this done as quickly as possible ensign\nwhat do you mean\nthats not possible were talking about human cells here not iso linear circuits i think you d better stick to engineering lieutenant\nthat was a real improvement\nsame time\nincredible the production of neurotransmitters in your brain has jumped by over five hundred percent pre and postsynaptic membranes have increased permeability to match it i couldnt even guess at your iq level now\nbut that isnt all the corpus callosum the connecting bridge between both sides of the brain it is so active now that the hemispheres are essentially behaving as one\nno creativity resourcefulness inspiration imagination theyve all been enhanced lieutenant you could very well be the most advanced human being who has ever lived\nnot necessarily it might be something as simple as an allergic reaction to a bee sting\ntheres something else captain he taught violin technique at the music school last night\nhe didnt not until last night\nlieutenant barclays performance was adequate but clearly not rooted in the method approach i do not understand why\nthe fusion reactors that power the array are extremely unstable there is a high risk of overload\nthey do not seem to be functioning at all sir\nno sir power emissions do not match any known radiation patterns we have not encountered this technology before sir\ncaptain sensors are reading no particulate emissions or subspace field distortions\nmethod of propulsion is unknown sir\ncaptain an energy field is forming around the device intensity is three point two tera watts and increasing\nthe probes field intensity is continuing to build sir we are in danger\ncaptain the probes energy output is overloading our shields failure anticipated in forty seven seconds\na standard isolation procedure would be advisable\nan interesting suggestion lieutenant however that approach would require much more time than our original plan at least seven weeks\nreactor nine will reach critical in ten minutes forty three seconds the subsequent explosion will create a chain reaction along the entire length of the array sir\nargus reactor nine twenty eight seconds to critical\ntwelve seconds to critical\ncaptain the argus reactors are shutting down we are no longer in danger sir\nunknown sir\nlieutenant barclay has not yet extended himself into the engineering subsystems it may be possible to establish an bypass directly to the bridge\nthis disturbance is the result of a highly charged graviton field emanating from our warp nacelles it is creating a severe bias in the subspace continuum\ni have been monitoring geordi s progress it will be operational in seventeen minutes\ncaptain we have not regained control of the propulsion systems the bypass to the bridge has been blocked\nwe are experiencing a quantum model oscillation delay doubling in intensity every twelve point three seconds bio cellular disruption is imminent\ncaptain all systems are back under helm control the computer has returned to normal functioning\ngsub ij of tast approaches infinity\nso it is so it is\nif we increase the value as you suggest we must face the possibility of twenty six dimensions instead often\ni certainly could not\ngruss gott they just might\ngood job reg and only what six weeks of lessons\naye sir lieutenant barclay report to the main shuttle bay\nenterprise this is shuttle five in position ready to begin a short range scan\nreg why dont we begin with the passive high res series all right\ngive it a try\nlets try the neutron densitometer\nhmm doesnt seem to want to give up any secrets lets go to activescan\nreally you are definitely not from our neighbourhood increase to three point zero\nyeah reg\ndont mention it youre one of my top engineers its about time you got in on some of the interesting stuff this this is why im in starfleet\nhit it with a positron emission\nwhat was that computers down re greg captains log supplemental an intense energy surge from the alien probe has severely disabled the shuttles on board computer the away team has been transported directly to sickbay where lieutenant barclay remains under observation\nmy visor must have filtered it out\nattempting to now commander isolate phasers eighty to one twenty shunt all the plasma\nphasers are a shot as we can make them captain\nyeah but by whom\nbarclay what are you doing\ni dont know how he did it but shield strength has been increased by three hundred percent\nit should be enough captain\ndont mention it captains log stardate 447053 the enterprise has destroyed the alien probe but now we are left with the difficult task of repairing the argus telescope failure to do so would represent an incalculable scientific loss\neach of the telescopes subspace antenna clusters is powered by its own fusion reactor but a single computer controls them all\nthats right they restarting to overload and could eventually go critical the explosion would destroy the array and i wouldnt want to be next door when that happens\ni agree well cut off each reactor from the damaged control system and repair them one by one\ntwo to three weeks at least\nbut the argus computer is inoperable\nsure reg\nwheres lieutenant barclay\ncomputer location of lieutenant barclay\nwe had a meeting at oh seven hundred\nwhat was that all about\na little most of the stuff on that blackboard was way out of myleague and yours too\nreg ever since our run in with that probe some things different about you\nyou just spent the entire night arguing grand unification theories with albert einstein\nreg some things happened to you and we cant ignore that\nyeah i think we do\nso its not just raw intelligence were talking about here\nhow can we do that what she done were talking about locking a man up for being too smart\nid hardly consider that a threat\nlook if we want to save the array we need barclay its as simple as that\ngo ahead lieutenant\nim on my way\nis the interface between the computer and the array still in operation\nthen well have to try a remote shut down from here\nwhat happened\ndamn\nlaforge to bridge were looking at a cascade reactor failure on the argus\ni dont think were going to pull this one out\nit wasnt me sir\nthat sitive disconnected the visual and audio pickups we can talk without being monitored by the computer\nit is now almost impossible to tell where barclay ends and the computer begin shes actually rewriting the iso linear chips each time he extends himself a little further\nwe dont not without killing him\nno but it would give us access to the propulsion systems enough to get us to the next starbase\na few hours\nyeah reg\nno im just catching up on some work you know that level three diagnostic we talked about how re you doing\nyeah try\nyou understand\nwell do you understand how this happened to you\nahha\nto tell you the truth reg we dont know what to think\nwhat do you mean\nready captain\nacknowledged\nwhat\nresetting stabilisers to match subspace flow matrix standby\njust plain old barclay huh\nthe tricky part is what happens afterwards\neither way reg your e an important part of this crew in fact i could really use your help with that level three diagnostic\nthe diagnostic can wait ill see you later\ncommander

eighteen reactors were affected when the computer was damaged\nhow long will that take\nwhat\nwhatever that alien probe did to him barclay now seems to know more about the internal workings of the enterprise than anyone else on board\nwe could confine him to his quarters\nif he s been influenced by an alien wouldnt that put us all at risk\ni didnt know barclay played the violin\nyou said he made a passat you but you failed to mention whether he was successful or not\nlaforge you ve got ten minutes mister worf red alert\nget us out of here\nwhat\ntheres not enough time\ngeordi what did you do\nbarclay\nbarclay\nbarclay whats going on barclay\nexactly what does that mean\nhow do we get him out of there\nhow long would it take to set that up\nhow soon before the process is in

holodeck\nwonderful wonderful\nwell done\nyouve come along way reg\ni dont just mean your acting ability it takes a great deal of courage to put yourself on display like that\nthere was a time when nothing could have dragged you onto a stage in front of an audience youve made tremendous progress\ndont you think so\ni disagree this isnt fantasy its theatre you used to withdraw onto the holodeck you isolated yourself inside your own imagination avoiding contact with real people look at yourself now look at all the other people your e with your e not just acting your e interacting give yourself some credit mister barclay\nreg may i join you\nhard at work\ni really enjoyed the scene you just performed\nnot at all i thought you were brilliant youve changed\npure observation\nim proud of your eg im glad for you too well id better be going\ni think so\nreg as your former counsellor i dont think it would be appropriate\ngoodnight mister barclay\nwell he did make a pass at me last night a good one\nno but its certainly unusual behaviour for barclay\ncaptain let me go to the holodeck and try and talk to him\nreg\nso amir eg youve frightened all of us im sure that wasnt your intent\nare we children to you now\nyou ve got it from all of us we dont need any more convincing please obey the captains orders stop whatever it is your e doing\nhow can we trust an officer who doesnt follow orders\nthe captain will do everything in his power to stop you\nso how much do you remember\nhow do you feel now\nyou know almost everyone has a moment in their lives when they exceed their own limits achieve what seems to be impossible\nyou almost always feel a sense of loss but it is possible to carry something of that experience through the rest of your life in ways that you are nt even aware of now\nexcuse me commander but i believe mister barclay and i had a date scheduled for a walk in the arboretum\ni know\ni didnt know you played chess\ncaptain i am picking up an unidentified device one point eight kilometres from the array\nnegative siri show no activity\ncaptain the probe has begun to move it is approaching the enterprise\naye sir\nprobe now closing at fifteen point three metres per second collision course\nthe probe is matching our speed and course\nsir the shuttlecraft shields did not provide sufficient protection for its computer our computer may

conceit i want to tell you about my detective story for several years now i have been trying to unravel the secrets of tagus three\nneedless to say ive not succeeded\nhowever i have i believe turned up some new information that if nothing else raises a whole new set of mysteries and i hope that we can discuss them here together\nthere have been nine hundred and forty seven known archaeological excavations conducted on the planets surface of those some seventy four are generally believed to have revealed findings of major importance\nthe earliest was some twenty two thousand years ago\nwhatthehell\nq\ni doubt there are many oak trees on tag usno i think this is supposed to be earth somewhere round about the twelfth century and this is england or to be more precise sherwood

    "episode 93": "about once a week\nno\ni had one of my assistants do that\nno nothing in fact he rarely spoke at all\nwell yes he gave him his injection\ni think so perhaps in ten forward\ni dont understand what relevance that has it was an innocent social gathering\nat the rate the levels are decreasing we will gain entry in forty nine hours captain\nslow motion study of the explosion suggests that the articulation frame collapsed\nother evidence lends credence to that theory captain a review of the sensor logs indicates that every systems reading was well within normal parameters until fifty two milliseconds before the explosion\nwe have made micro tomographic analyses of the dilithium chamber the hatch mounting the blast pattern from the explosion\nthose fractures suggest nothing more than simple neutron fatigue i would speculate that when the engine was last inspected at mckinley station the hatch casing was replaced with one which had an undetectable defect i believe sir that the conclusion to our investigation must be that the explosion was not intentional\ncaptain warp engines are back online we are ready to commence restart sequences sir\ni didnt\nit must be a mistake\ni know nothing about it\nnoi was not involved you accuse me because i am klingon\nsend me home then if you are so distrusting\ni have nothing more to say\non the klingon home world your name is not mentioned it is as though you never existed a terrible burden for a warrior to bear to become nothing to be without honour without the chance for glory\ni have friends powerful friends on the homeworld i could talk to them they might help to restore your name if you could just take me to a shuttlecraft\nit could be done without anyone knowing about it\npah tk\nthat proves nothing\ni take injections everyone knows that\nthe blood of all klingons has become water since the federation alliance we have turned into a nation of mewling babies romulans are strong they are worthy allies they do not turn klingons into weaklings like you\ni had nothing to do with that\ni do not know i had nothing to do with it\ni am not lying\nadmiral we still cant get in there captain the radiation levels are dropping but they re too high to raise the isolation door\nmay be the admiral would like to see the visual log of the explosion\nthis was logged four days ago at oh three hundred hours\nat that point the emergency confinement field was activated and the isolation doors came down no one was killed but i have two people in sickbay with radiation burns\nwe have nt found anything that suggests there was a malfunction anywhere along the line\nengineering to captain picard\ncaptain could you come to engineering right away we ve got something interesting to show you\ncaptain we finally got in here about six hours ago we ve been going over it inch by inch ever since\nwe did mass spectrometer readings of the residue for chemical content sifted through the debris for bomb fragments\nthis is the frame for the hatch it ruptured right along here when we take a reading of that spot see\nthats right a breakdown of the atomic cohesive structure\nthats the way i see it this wasnt sabotage at all it was nothing more than an accident\nadmiral satie has ordered you to report to the interrogation room at oh nine hundred hours tomorrow morning you are to be questioned before the committee captains log supplemental admiral thomas henry who has worked closely with norah satie in the past has arrived to observe the hearings\nadmiral satie welcome aboard the enterprise\nthis is my first officer commander william riker may i show you to your quarters\nvery well commander riker will you see to the admirals staff\nadmiral satie this is commander data commander laforge\nhow much longer will it be\nthats one reason we tend to suspect sabotage\nby all means admiral\nthere are disturbing overtones in the idea of a klingon providing information to the romulans are you aware of any other klingon romulan connection that starfleet command might have encountered recently\nthis ship has encountered several incidents which might suggest a potential alliance between those two powers\ncome\nplease mister worf come ini particularly want my guest to meet you admiral satie this is my head of security lieutenant worf\nmister worf you may have him confined\nbut if youre right someone else may be involved\ni can scarcely believe it myself but i am so grateful for your presence admiral if anyone in starfleet can help us its you\nin what way\nthat sounds like judge aaron satie\nonly from his writings his judgments were required reading at the academy\nim willing to wager that you trounced your brothers during those debates\nyou must miss him very much\nthank you doctor crusher we appreciate your time you are excused now mister worf will you bring in the next person\nplease sit down mister t arses for the record will you tell us your name and position\ni assure you this is an informal inquiry we are not accusing you of anything however if you would like counsel it can be provided for you\ntell me how long have you held your appointment on board this vessel\nyour e excused crewman\nmister worf\nits clear that he s frightened but thats hardly an indication\nadmiral i have to tell you you must not expect me to permit any action against mister t arses solely on the basis of beta zoid intuition\nim not happy about this use of a beta zoid\nthere is a difference between a counsellor and an investigator\nyes i do but i would not act solely on the basis of her instinct\nbut your e asking your e asking me to restrict mister t arses movements solely on the basis on sabin s feeling\nyes i admit i probably would and perhaps i should reevaluate that behaviour\nif we had clear evidence\nno i wont treat a man as a criminal unless there is cause to do so\nyes mister laforge\nill be right there\nthere are submicron fractures in the metal casing\nif my crew say there was no sabotage then you can be sure there was none\ndo we know that for sure\ni agree it would be difficult but not impossible\nnow please let me remind you he is innocent until he is proved guilty\nvery well but let us put this to rest as quickly as possible\nyouve opened the hearing to spectators\nnevertheless admiral i think it would be wise\nthis hearing is convened on stardate 44780 as a continuing inquiry into the activities of crewman simon t arses mister t arses for your own protection i have assigned a counsel to you in the person of commander william riker\nthank you doctor if you have a case to make against t arses you had better make it otherwise im stopping this here and now\nagreed mister sabin\nmister worf\ni need to speak with you\ndo you see what is happening here mister worf\nthis is not unlike a drumhead trial\nfive hundred years ago military officers would up end a drum on the battlefield sit at it and dispense summary justice decisions were quick punishments severe appeals denied those who came to a drumhead were doomed\nthats true and he will stand for his crimes\nhow\nthat is not a crime worf nor can we infer his guilt because he didnt respond\noh no we can not allow ourselves think that the seventh guarantee is one of the most important rights granted by the federation we can not take a fundamental principle of the constitution and turn it against a citizen\noh yes thats how it starts but the road from legitimate suspicion to rampant paranoia is very much shorter than we think something is wrong here mister worf i dont like what we have become\nthere you are mister t arses would you care for some lemon\nwell tell me a little about yourself crewman i know you were born on mars colony\ndid you ever consider applying to the academy going the whole route apply to become an officer\nan elm tree with a circular bench\ni spent many an hour there it was my favourite spot to study\nyou didnt do it\nnot if you are nt guilty simon\nadmiral satie\nadmiral satie\ni would like to have a word with you\nin private and off the record\nbut i do this must stop it has gone too far you lied to him about the engine room there were no volatile chemicals found there\nwe are hounding an innocent man\nive talked with him\nno he admits his mistake in falsifying his application that does not make him a traitor\nthe hearings on simon t arses will stop if necessary i will go to starfleet command\nwhat are you saying\nyou never told me about this\nadmiral what your e doing here is unethical its immoral ill fight it\nyes yes yes of course proceed mister data\nyes of course number one just a little preoccupied\njean luc picard\ncaptain federation starship enterprise\nfor three years since stardate 41124\nif you dont mind theres something id like to say\ni believe that chapter four article twelve of the uniform code of justice grants me the right to make a statement before questioning begins\ni am deeply concerned by what is happening here it began when we apprehended a spy a man who admitted his guilt and who will answer for his crime but the hunt didnt end there another man mister simon t arses was brought to trial and it was a trial no matter what others choose to call it a trial based on insinuation and innuendo nothing substantive offered against mister t arses much less proven mister t arses grandfather is romulan and for that reason his career now stands in ruins have we become so fearful have we become so cowardly that we must extinguish a man because he carries the blood of a current enemy admiral let us not condemn simon t arses or anyone else because of their bloodlines or investigate others for their innocent associations i implore you do not continue with this proceeding end it now\nof course\nyour point admiral\nmy reports to starfleet document the circumstances in each of those instances\ni beg your pardon\ni was following orders to take this ambassador to a location near the neutral zone\nthats correct\nno\nlieutenant\nyes i have completely recovered\nyou know there some words ive known since i was a schoolboy with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censured the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably those words were uttered by judge aaron satie as wisdom and warning the first time any mans freedom is trodden on were all damaged i fear that today\nno please mister worf come in\nthats good\nwe think we ve come so far the torture of heretics the burning of witches its all ancient history then before you can blink an eye it suddenly threatens to start all over again\nmister worf villains who wear twirl their moustaches are easy to spot those who clothe themselves in good deeds are well camouflaged\nmaybe but she or someone like her will always be with us waiting for the right climate in which to flourish spreading fear in the name of righteousness vigilance mister worf that is the price we have to continually pay back to the episode listing star trek and related marks are trademarks of studios inc copyright 1966 present the star trek web pages on this site are for educational and entertainment purposes only all other copyrights property of their respective holders\nare you all right captain\nwhat were you doing accessing the propulsion system files on stardate 44758\nyes you did from computer twelve b nine deck thirtysix the computer logged in your identification from your communicator\ni suppose you know nothing about the explosion that disabled the warp drive at approximately the same time\nweve already contacted the klingon high council youll be returned home as soon as we finished our investigation\nvery well worf accompany the lieutenant to his quarters\nwhat do you think\ni object there is no basis for calling crewman t arses a liar\ni believe he stelling the truth he admits stealing the files but not sabotaging the dilithium chamber i get no sense that he s lying\nyouve done a thorough job lieutenant\nyes i can see that i dont mind telling you im surprised frankly when i first heard about your father\nyes there are some who believe he betrayed your people to the romulans\nof course i only meant before i saw you in action i naturally considered you a possible security risk but i want you to know you have the admirals and my complete confidence you have nothing to prove to us\ngood you know the ship you know the personnel you know exactly what were up against were counting on you lieutenant\ndid you ever hear him say anything anything that may have seemed innocent at the time that might now shed some light on this investigation\ndid he ever make any comments that might in retrospect be suspicious\nwait hes lying hes desperately frightened hes covering something\nits more than that he was nt truthful hes covering a lie one so big its overwhelming him i think weve found the man\nan accident i find that hard to believe\nand he had confederates\ncaptain picard lieutenant worf and i have been working well together i suggest we continue if for no other purpose than to determine t arses innocence\nmister t arses isnt it true that you have access to the biological supplies in sickbay\njd an used suspensions of deoxyribose to carry the encoded files he stole isnt it true one of your duties is to prepare those suspensions\nand isnt it true that your security clearance allows you access to all the stores and files in sickbay access which you can exercise at anytime\nwhat would you say if i told you there is evidence that the explosion in the engine room was caused by a corrosive chemical one that is kept stored in sickbay\nhow can we believe you how can we believe someone whom we know we know to be a liar\ncaptain there is a basis which will become clear in a moment mister t arses didnt you deliberately and pre meditatively lied when you filled out your personnel application and compounded that lie by repeating it to this committee\nisnt it true that the paternal grandfather of whom you speak was not a vulcan but was in fact a romulan that it is romulan blood you carry and a romulan heritage that you honour\nwere waiting mister t arses\nyour full name\nrank and position\nhow long have you held this post\nvery well admiral\ncaptain could you tell us just what happened on stardate 44390\nlet me refresh your memory you were transporting a vulcan ambassador tp el\nin fact she was not a vulcan at all was she she was a romulan spy\na spy whom you were delivering back into the hands of the enemy\ndont you think its questionable judgment captain to have a security officer whose father was a romulan collaborator\nperhaps we should call a recess until tomorrow\ncaptain picard\ndelighted to be here i managed to acquire my former staff my aide sabin genes tra from beta zed and my assistant nellen to re from del b two\ncaptain if starfleet command is so concerned with your report they brought me out of retirement i think i should get right to work\nfirst id like to inspect the damage to your engine room\nyes\nhave you been able to make any assessments\nthe schematics that were stolen from the enterprise i believe some involved the articulation frame of the dilithium chamber\ncaptain i think im going to need a full briefing before we go any further\ncommander data laforge i dont envy you your job good luck\ni dont believe what starfleet command knows or doesnt know is for me to reveal\nwere aware of that captain what we must concentrate on is the business at hand\nwell done lieutenant\nor perhaps with their knowledge\nthe body itself becomes a conveyor of top secret files lieutenant worf when we confront j dani want you to conduct the interrogation\ncaptain i predict that officer will be extremely valuable in this investigation\nlieutenant how did you damage the dilithium chamber\nyou mean it was sheer coincidence that it was sabotaged after you gave the plans for the design to the romulans\nyouve admitted your crime why lie now\nsabin\ni think captain you have a bigger problem on your ship than one klingon exchange officer\nive seen this before the spectre of conspiracy on a starship is a frightening one\ncaptain i find myself changing my mind about you\nwhen starfleet ordered me here it was with the express command that we work together on this problem as equals my father taught me to avoid partnerships most of them are woefully lopsided\nyou knew my father\nhe was an extraordinary man every night at the dinner table he would pose a question for debate my big brothers and i would wrangle it around from one side and the other father would referee and he kept a stopwatch on us sowed have to learn brevity but he wouldnt let us leave until he thought wed completely explored the issue\nmore than once father loved it when i nailed one of them with some subtle point of logic all that i am i owe to him he was a giant\ncaptain i always preferred working alone that way if something goes wrong i dont have to go far for the cause i resented you being assigned to me but i was wrong were going to be quite a team\nand how often did lieutenant jd an come in for his injections\ndid you administer them yourself\nthen who did\nmister t arses your records state that you were born on mars colony\nthen you are human\nyes i see that tell me what is your relationship with the klingon jd an\ndid you give him those injections\ndid you ever see him outside sickbay\nthank you mister t arses i dont think there s need for more captain\nsabin has uncanny instincts ive learned to trust them\nbut you have a beta zoid counsellor surely your e aware of the advantages\nare you saying you never use your counsellor during interrogations\nnor do i\nif counsellor troi suggested to you that someone on the ship were dangerous would you not act on that observe him curb his activity\noh nonsense lets keep our priorities straight the important thing is to uncover the conspiracy on this ship and to prevent further damage now iftar ses is a possible saboteur you can not allow him access to sensitive areas of the ship and i strongly suggest continuous surveillance\nwe will have clear evidence sabin and lieutenant worf are continuing to investigate but if you dont act until then it may be too late\nand while your e being so generous you give a saboteur a chance to strike again last time it was just a hatch cover what if next time its more serious what if lives are lost can you afford not to act\nwhat did you find\nim afraid im out of my element commander youll have to interpret for me\nyes and what caused them\nlet us keep our perspective gentlemen just because there was no sabotage doesnt mean there isnt a conspiracy on this ship we do have a confessed spy\nof course he did do you think jd an could have come onboard the flagship of the federation and accomplished what he did without help from within\nof course he is what sabin is saying is that he and lieutenant worf would like to establish his innocence unequivocally for his own sake\nit isnt good to have closed door proceedings for too long it invites rumour and speculation\nbecause spies and saboteurs dont like the bright light of an open inquiry theyre like roaches scurrying for the dark corner\ndoctor crusher have you observed crewman t arses with jd an\ni meant outside of sickbay\nand whom else have you observed at these occasions\nif it was so innocent why do you hesitate to give us the names\nmister worf has found a brother who still lives on mars colony contact someone there and have him interviewed\nand start a background check into all his friends at the academy training programme\nyes captain\nof course\nof course after all you are my partner in this\ni can not possibly believe you mean this\nit was a tactic a way of applying pressure\nand how may i ask have you managed to determine that\ni see and he told you he was a victim of circumstance blameless and pure\nhow can you be so incredibly naive captain may i tell you how ive spent the last four years from planet to starbase to planet i have no home i live on starships and shuttlecraft i havent seen a family member in years i have no friends but i have a purpose my father taught me from the time i was a little girl still clutching a blanket that the united federation of planets is the most remarkable institution ever conceived and it is my cause to make sure that this extraordinary union be preserved i can not imagine why you are trying to block this investigation there have been others in the past who doubted me they came to regret it\ni have news for you captain ive been in constant contact with starfleet command the hearings are not going to stop theyre going to be expanded\nim going to get to the heart of this conspiracy if it means investigating every last person on this ship and every hearing from now on will be held in the presence of admiral thomas henry of starfleet security ive requested he be brought here at once\ni report to starfleet command directly i do not need your permission or your approval for my decisions\ndo what you must captain and so willi\nif you have a statement youll have an opportunity to make it later\nvery well\ncaptain do you believe in the prime directive\nin fact its starfleet general order number one is it not\nwould it surprise you to learn that you have violated the prime directive a total of nine times since you took command of the enterprise i must say captain it surprised the hell out of me\nyes were looking into those reports captain very closely into those reports after which im sure well have more questions for you about your so called commitment to starfleet s prime directive\ni dont think we need the preamble\ntell me captain when the deception was revealed and she stood proudly on the bridge of a romulan ship did you make any effort to retrieve her\nno even though you knew she carried federation secrets that shed been accumulating for years\nreally lieutenant and where were you when this traitor was onboard the enterprise where was ships security\ntell me captain have you completely recovered from your experience with the borg\nit must have been awful for you actually becoming one of them being forced to use your vast knowledge of starfleet operations to aid theborg just how many of our ships were lost thirty nine and a loss of life i believe measured at nearly eleven thousand one wonders how you can sleep at night having caused so much destruction i question your actions captain i question your choices i question your loyalty\nhow dare you you who consort with romulans invoke my fathers name to support your traitorous arguments it is an offence to everything i hold dear and to hear those words used to subvert the united federation of planets my father was a great man his name stands for integrity and principle you dirty his name when you speak it he loved the federation but you captain corrupt it you undermine our very way of life i will expose you for what you are ive brought down bigger men than you picard\ni have nothing more to say\nsimon t arses crewman first class medical technician\nno siri have nothing to hide\nsince stardate 43587\nthats right\nlargely my paternal grandfather was vulcan\ner he i mean theres no relationship he just came in for his injections\nsometimes there were several of us actually i might have done it twice\nnot really he hardly ever talked\nonce or twice in ten forward with a group of people but i never had a conversation with him\nthank you sir but i dont need protection i have not done anything wrong\nits part of my job yes\nseveral technicians share that job\nbecause i have access does not mean i\ni had nothing to do with that\nwhat\non the advice of my counsel i refuse to answer that question in that the answer may serve to incriminate me\nno thank you sir this is fine\nyes sir all my life i wanted to be in starfleet i went to the academy s training programme for enlisted personnel i took training as a medical technician and i served at several outposts the day that i was posted to the enterprise was the happiest day of my life\nmy parents wanted me to and then i thought about it i used to sit under this big tree near the parade grounds\nyes thats the one\ni used to sit under that tree and watch the drills picture myself an officer i know that it would have made my mother very happy but\nnoi was eighteen and eager the last thing i wanted to do was spend four years sitting in classrooms i wanted to be out there travelling the stars i didnt want to wait for anything and now its done isnt it my career in starfleet is finished\nit doesnt matter i lied on my application and that mistake will be with me for the rest of my life\njd an we have confirmed reports that schematic drawings of our dilithium chamber fell into romulan hands one week later\nour chief security officer is klingon that has nothing to do with it\nits hard to tell he is very closed but he is hiding something\ni dont know how you transferred secret information to the romulans but i will find out\nwhen we inform the klingon high council they will put you to a slow death captains log supplemental retired admiral norah satie whose investigation exposed the alien conspiracy against starfleet command three years ago is arriving to assist in our inquiry\nexcuse me captain i didnt know that\ncaptain i have been pursuing the investigation of lieutenant j dani believe i know how he transferred information off the enterprise\nthis is j dans a hypo spray he uses to treat his balt mas or syndrome but this has been fitted with an optical reader specially modified to read data from starfleet iso linear chips he can extract digital information from a computer encode it in the form of amino acid sequences and transfer those sequences into a fluid in the syringe then he injects someone perhaps even without their knowledge\nthe information would be carried in their blood stream in the form of inert proteins\ni would be honoured captain admiral\ni have tracked the movements of every person who has left the enterprise since you have been here it race done tarkanian diplomat as far as the cruces system where he disappeared and has not been seen since\na hypo syringe was discovered in your quarters\nbut your injections do not include an optical chip reader this device has but one function to transform computer information into biological sequences\njd an did not make friends easily there are not many to question\ni am strongly motivated in this matter\nmy father\nwhat he did or did not do is no ones concern but my own\nif there is a conspiracy on board i promise you i will find it\ni will arrange for the interviews to begin\nwe should continue to investigate t arse she was hiding something\nyou and crewman marcus will coordinate to track t arses movements over the last five years ensign kellogg i want a list of all relatives known associates and especially old school friends and make arrangements to doane ncep halo graphic polygraphs can\nyes captain\nyou are dismissed please get your reports to me as soon as possible\nsir\ni do not understand\nbut we know there is a traitor here jd an has admitted his guilt\nt arses has all but done the same\nhe refused to answer the question about his romulan grandfather\nsir if a man were not afraid of the truth he would answer\nsir the federation does have enemies we must seek them out\nthe enterprise could have been captured by the romulans captain picard did the only thing he could\nami bothering you captain\nit is over admiral henry has called an end to any more hearings on this matter\nadmiral satie has left the enterprise\ni believed her i helped her i did not see what she was\ni think after yesterday people will not be as ready to trust her",

alone\nwhat difference do a few years make\nare you aware these people you are so graciously helping are murderers\nwell the next thing to it when a person on this benighted little planet reaches the age of sixty which tim icin is about to do they re expected to simply kill themselves did you know that\nwell i know tim ic in himself just told me he is supposed to go down there to his loving friends be wined dined honoured for his achievements and then kill himself its a barbaric ritual the resolution its called obviously you cant let him go jean luc\ni dont think you ve been listening to me the man is supposed to kill himself you dont just let that happen you dont just turn your back whats the matter with you\nbut you have to in a situation like this you absolutely have to interfere you ve got to go down there and talk to those people jean luc open their eyes educate them\nwell thats your prime directive not mine\nwhat do you mean i cant go down there are you telling me that im a prisoner on this ship\nwell i am sure i am a beta zoid ambassador im a daughter of the fifth house and those people are going to answer to me so you just energise this damned thing and get me down there\nhis orders dont apply to me\ndont you try your professional patronising on me young lady they expect tim ic into die dont you realise that just because he s sixty whats sixty its nothing\nim sorry little one i dont know whats wrong with me im sorry\nbut im crying i dont cry\nyou remember that\nbut this isnt the same is it\ni dont know i just cant accept that fate will allow me to meet him like this and then take him away i mean he sno till he has nt had a tragic accident hes just going to die and for no good reason because his society has decided that he s too old so they just dispose

do and i hate you for doing it\ni never will never\ni dont know a minute an hour\ndo you want anything some tea\nno no your e not cruel to them you just kill them\na celebration of life it sounds very noble very caring what your e really saying is you got rid of the problem by getting rid of the people\nwhat about the responsibility of caring of the elderly\nwe raise them we care for them we suffer for them we keep them from harm their whole lives eventually its their turn to take care of us\nwell why the hell not osk oids\noskoidsabetazed delicacy\nyou should have tried it while you were still alive no reason to bother now why sixty why not sixty two or fifty eight\nbut its not reasonable certainly not in your case your e as vital and healthy amana sive ever known\nbut it makes no sense some of your people could still be active at seventy or eighty and others might be seriously ill at fifty how cruel of you to make them wait so long to commit suicide\ni agree why not let everybody die when they die\nyou have a grandson you said\nwell wouldnt it be better for him to know his grandfather not some vague memory of someone who once loved him but a real living person who does love him dont you really think that would be better\nthe women of beta zed used to wear these enormous wigs with large holes in the cen re for tiny caged animals\nfirst it was a fashion then it went on long enough to become a custom a tradition but it was uncomfortable for the woman and cruel to the animal so then one day on every formidable woman finally said so refused ever to wear another of those wigs fairly so on the custom stopped she had the courage to stand up and fight for change\ntim ic in there is no one more qualified more experienced or more likely to save their planet than you and they would have you kill yourself\nyour planet has what thirty forty years left what if your scientists cant find the answer without you what then what chance do you think your grandson has of reaching the age of sixty\nif thats the way it is i dont know why anyone s bothering to try to save your world at all if its time has come let it die wheres the difference tim icin where\nbut jean luc will find a way to settle this he always does\nnow dont be foolish\nyou have made a statement about the sanctity of life and it will be heard tim ic in\ntim ic in\nive been looking forward to meeting you dara\nyour fathers work may save your world my dear i would hardly consider that irrelevant\nperhaps you will feel differently as you get a little older say approaching sixty\nit san obscene

but i enjoy living and now i am asking myself is it possible i was wrong to encourage tim ic in to choose life\nmay be i want him to live just to keep me company\ndid i then look what ive done to him

preliminary reports of the test i dont understand where i went wrong i thought id taken into account all of the variables deep convection patterns proton reactions neutrino count\ni will say it again you are a kind woman\nit is the way of my world i wish you could accept that\nhow long have you been sitting there\nl wax ana\ni want to explain i want very much for you to understand fifteen or twenty centuries ago we had no resolution we had no such concern for our elders as people aged their health failed they became invalids those whose families could no longer care for them were put away in deathwatch facilities where they waited in loneliness for the end to come sometimes for years they had meant something and they were forced to live beyond that into a time of meaning nothing of knowing they could now only be the beneficiaries of younger people s patience we are no longer that cruel l wax ana\nthe resolution is a celebration of life it allows us to end our lives with dignity\nit may sound that way but it is a time of transition one generation passing on the responsibilities of life to the next\nthat would place a dreadful burden on the children\nno parent should expect to be paid back for the love theyve given their children\nwhats that\nlooks very interesting\na reasonable age had to be set\nthat is why i wish to say goodbye to my family and colleagues while iam this way incomplete command of my faculties knowing they will always remember me as a strong and vigorous man\nsetting a standard age for the resolution makes it uniform for everybody to ask individual families to decide when their elders are to die that would be heartless\nl wax ana\nyes almost seven\ni attended the resolution of my parents when it was their time it was beautifull wax

ana and that is the way it is\nconvection boundary uncoupling the reaction caused gas turbulence of a totally unexpected magnitude why\nno id anticipated that i thought id anticipated all possible variables but stars theyre like living entities in away quite unpredictable you know i wouldnt be at all surprised if this were the result of look here forty two seconds into the test there is a sudden rise in the level of hydrogen alpha emissions and here heres another im right arent i there had to be neutron migration within the stars inner core as the reaction grew\nyes yes but theoretically it is possible using these test results we could construct a new computer model of the energy dynamics of a star that can test a new detonation programme im certain it can be accomplished certain its just a matter of time a matter of time\ncaptain i have come to officially request asylum aboard the enterprise\ni turn sixty in four days minister\ni believe that it is time for us to reexamine as a people the wisdom of the resolution\ninfluenced perhaps coerced no\nno one on kael on two understands this project as i do there are new theories that would take others a decade to test and confirm with my guidance it can be done in half that time i must finish my work\nb tard at theres no purpose at all in letting this become\nit shouldnt have happened ive handled this poorly\ni could have let well enough alone i could have returned home what do you think captain have i done the right thing\nl wax ana would have me lead are vol tim only a scientist i wish i had her strength she is a woman of extraordinary conviction isnt she\ncaptain\ni dont want there to be any bloodshed because of my decision\nyes yes of course i understand\nwe must transmit the new analysis of the neutron migration immediately if i can make them see the direction ive taken\nthey have to accept them if i can reestablish computer interface with the science ministry\nwhy dont they answer even if i find the solution you will not accept it because i do not terminate my life they terminate my work alive i am a greater threat to my world than a dying sun\nno my decision will only lead to more distrust of other worlds nothing will change\ni am not being foolish l wax anai want to live because i see in you how much i have to live for you make me realise that my life still has

theres a minor vascular irregularity in the visual cortex a slight dilation of the blood vessels its nothing serious what about your visor has it been giving you any problems lately\nall the same it might be a good idea to have it examined when we get to starbase thirtysix next month\nin the meantime i will get you a som netic inducer to put by your bed itll help you to sleep\nwelcome back

actual intent was to emphasise that you did enjoy yourself yes i see how that could be considered quite amusing\ncommander riker\nour sensors have detected a brief energy fluctuation in the eb and\nunknown sire band emissions are difficult to localise\nyes sir however there are no protostars in this sector\nyes sir\nenergy flow is within normal parameters from the pre fire chamber to the emission aperture\nenergy cell usage remains constant at one point oh five mega joules per second curious the efficiency reading on the discharge crystal is well above starfleet specifications\nour most efficient discharge crystal typically fires with eightysix point five percent efficiency\npulse frequency out of pre fire chamber reads steady\nthat might suggest that the weapon has been charged with a forced pulse well into the terahertz range\nthree hundred twenty seven to our knowledge we can probably achieve an exact match with a random computer search it will take approximately three hours\nyes sir however the difference in intensity indicates that this one did not originate from the same location as the first\nthat is a reasonable assumption\nnot to my knowledge sir\nwe can reconfigure the primary sensor array if we narrow their focus to scan for eb and emissions we might be able to calculate a directional vector but only if there are more occurrences\nsensors confirm an unauthorised transporter beam at eleven twenty three hours\nthe primary plasma system does not indicate a power drain from any of the transporters\ntracking power from secondary systems no surges to

immediately\nthat is an order\ni believe i can help captain i have been able to determine that commander laforge was abducted by romulans en route to risa it is likely that he was somehow forced to take part in the plot to assassinate governor va gh\nno sir you did not i do not believe the commander is acting of his own accord he has been receiving e band signals through his visor signals which are carrying direct commands to his brain i have surmised that commander laforge was conditioned by romulans a process referred to historically and somewhat in accurately as brainwashing\nno sir that is not possible the signals had to be transmitted within close proximity to the visor\nyes sir i am\ni have narrowed the list of possibilities to two people the only two people who were with commander laforge all three times a transmission was recorded captain picard and ambassador kell one of them may be concealing an e band transmitter if they would agree to be searched\nbut how will it be possible to prove which one was responsible\nthere was a time when the empire would crush a rebellion now it is tolerated we have enough problems on the home planet we dont wish to divert resources to

a closer look at the wave pattern on the emission beam that might tell us why its losing so little energy\nthere thats not right the initial output spike is inverted\nthen its definitely not starfleet issue and there cant be that many systems that use the terahertz feeds\ni think we could narrow this down with a little common sense data who has the most to gain from a conflict between the klingon empire and the federation\nthe romulans they fashioned a perfect federation rifle but they had to charge it from their energy sources so the discharge crystal and the emission beam pattern correspond

thats for sure\nit might be possible to locate the point of origin by tracing power flows at the time of transport\nthen whoever used the transporter must have bypassed the primary feeds\ndamn who could have pulled this off try the life support power flows\nreplicator waveguides there thats not a replicator energy pattern trace it\nlaforge to worf security to cargo bay four\nthis has to be the

on risa\nwell i was just trying to get in the mood i played some music i talked to the computer you know what its like on a long trip\nno the first thing i did wait a minute thats but thats\nim just not sure about anything\nfinally i think ive found it you see this piece of conduit carrying the power to transporter seven and i know that cant be rights oi take a closer look and sure enough\ni have to\nits all right\nits nothing just a little cold\nits nothing serious\nill just go to my quarters and change\ndont think twice about it commander\nive run a level one diagnostic as far as i can tell

necessary step i apologize for your discomfort\nhere observe how a spring day on his native earth affects him he s looking at a beautiful meadow green trees birds a blue sky the heartbeat slows the galvanic skin response drops the body responds to our stimuli he is incapable of maintaining control of his own responses watch asi change the stimuli again once our work is done laforge will act normally totally unaware of his conditioning the perfect tool for our purpose\nnone commander that is why we chose laforge the utilisation of his preexisting neural implants makes our work impossible to detect\ni will programme him to perform a series of specific tests both before he leaves us and after he returns to the enterprise well be able to verify his effectiveness notice that his heart rate has slowed somewhat he is becoming accustomed to the horrors he is witnessing so we change horrors\nwhere are we mister laforge\nwho is that man sitting over there\nhow long has he served with you\ni want you to kill him\ntake this phaser and kill chief obrien\nfreeze simulations commander did you understand my request\nlook at me now what did i ask you to do\nthen do asi asked resume

officer are incompatible with remaining on board a klingon ship during a time of war\nthere have been three major engagements in the last two weeks all of them won by ships loyal to the duras family\nagreed but if the duras are being aided by the romulans it becomes very much our concern the romulans have been attempting to destroy the klingon federation alliance for the past twenty years at the same time the duras have been secretly conspiring with the romulans doesnt it strike you as odd that the duras are able to field such an overpowering force against gowron that they out match him at almost every turn\nand some would say they must be getting help the romulans are prepared to take enormous risks to gain any advantage over the federation can we seriously believe that now with the future of the klingon empire in the balance they are content to standby and watch\nwe must stop the flow of supplies and equipment to the duras from the romulans what i propose is that we send a fleet to the romulan klingon border well take no offensive action but we will be in a position to expose any romulan supplies that attempt to cross the border\nexactly\nmy chief engineer has developed a system that should nullify that advantage each ship will send out an active tachyon beam to the other blockading ships now in theory any cloaked vessel that attempts to pass between our ships must cross that beam and be detected\nso do i number one captains log stardate 450213 convincing starfleet command to establish a blockade was relatively painless implementing that plan is proving more troublesome\nmister laforge can you implement your tachyon detection grid with twenty ships\nall right i want to add the tianna n men the sutherland and the hermes whether the yard superintendent says

romulans to detect the tachyon field once its activated\nvery well energise the network\nnot yet\non screen tasha\nso you believe her counsellor\nbesides tasha was a child when this woman was born\nbut why what possible advantage could there be to the romulans as this now stands i dont think this will have any impact on our strategy well continue the blockade leave the next move to them thank you\nno not at all is something wrong\ni think that the romulans are just hoping to create a distraction they want to keep us off balance\nenterprise c she was lost at the battle of narendra three defending a klingon outpost from the romulans\nthere were stories of prisoners taken back to romulus but these were only rumours\nguinan that was twenty three years ago tasha yar was only a child\nhow can that be\ntasha died a year before you came on the enterprise you never met her\nif you have only a vague intuition\ni think that its time i met commanders ela\nplease wont you sit down\nim afraid that you have misinterpreted our presence here i want to reassure you that we have no hostile intention\nit is our intent to prevent any external power from interfering in klingon affairs\nthen why dont you just take your ships across\nall right why did i invite you here\nits been suggested that she was aboard the enterprise c when it was destroyed twenty four years ago that she was one of the survivors and that obviously you are a product of a union between her and a romulan\nand yet you claim that it is possible that your e the daughter of tasha yar\ni want to meet your mother can you arrange that\ndoubt sim full of them but nothing in my experience can persuade me that what you have told me is true and i do know one thing it will not affect my judgment at our next encounter\nin thirteen hours well be forced to either withdraw from the border or fight the romulan fleet neither alternative is acceptable we must expose their involvement before the deadline\nif you launch a full scale attack now then the duras fleet will call for supplies l ursa and bet or will call for help the romulans will try to run the blockade and well be ready for them\nwhen gowron begins his attack then we will make our move excalibur will fall back with engine problems you will take the akagi and the hornet to this position which will open a small gap in our detection net\nexactly when they try to bring their ships through the enterprise and the tianna n men will swing around close the gap and catch them in the act\ngood luck will\nsignal the fleet to stand by\nopen a channel

loss in the mem pa system his forces will not threaten you in that region for some time\nthe convoy will arrive in due course\nwhos commanding this fleet\nsilence the child or send him away mo var i want you to return to romulus immediately have all available ships rendezvous at these coordinates in two days\nperhaps\ntheyre using the beams as a detection field\nissue orders to begin work on a way to penetrate this field in the meantime well have to convince captain picard he should leave\nno captain i am commanders ela the woman you knew as tasha yar was my mother deploying an invasion fleet along our border is a clear act of aggression captain it will not be tolerated you have twenty hours to recall your ships and return peacefully to federation territory\nwell captain what is this urgent matter we need to discuss\nah then i can tell my superiors that a fleet of twenty three federation starships is on our border for what humanitarian reasons\nnor do we have any plan to do so but captain if for any reason we chose to enter klingon territory how would you stop us with our cloaking devices we can slip by you at will\nyou sound eager for us to try perhaps youve discovered a method in detecting our ships however i dont think you asked me here to discuss our military situation\nyou want the answer to the only question on your mind how could tasha yar be my mother\nbut you know that s impossible she would have been a child when that battle occurred\nyes she was on that ship twenty four years ago she was sent thereby you from the future she was among those few who survived they were all to have been executed after the interrogation but a romulan general saw her and became enamoured with her so a deal was struck their lives would be spared if she became his consort i was born a year later\none night when i was four years old she came to me she bundled me up and she told me to stay quiet as we left the compound i realised she was taking me away she was taking me away from my home my father so i cried out my father offered her life he gave her a home gave her a child and how did she repay him by betrayal they executed her everything in me that was human died that day with my mother all thats left is romulan never doubt that\nyou have fourteen hours captain i suggest you use them wisely\nenough l ursa you failed i need to know the strength and capabilities of the federation fleet i dont have time for this turn him over to the guard bet or can have him back when theyve finished with him\nyou mean they were caught unprepared and now theyre crying for help have the science sections found a way to circumvent the detection grid yet\ngood\ntheir warp drive is failing\nhe doesnt have enough ships to maintain the network\nno i dont think so\nyes i know and so does picard hes giving us exactly what we need and he expects us to take it now e wont step into picard strap we will disable part of his network here where they re weakest well direct the energy burst right at the ship with the android captain\nnow\ncome to course zero eight zero mark two nine five\nreverse course order the fleet back to romulan territory\nwe ve been exposed its over\ntell them theyre on their own\nnone of which is our concern jean luc the klingon civil war is by definition an internal matter of the empire\nsome would call it good leadership\nwhat is it you propose captain\na blockade\nbut how would you overcome the romulan cloaking device\nill have to clear this with the federation council in the meantime assemble your fleet captain\nfollow me and i will show you honour\nwhat does it mean is the federation going to enter the war should we attack them before they get here\nhow where are the romulans\nno\nthe duras family will one day rule the empire\nim not saying we should accept her claim at face value but i sensed no deception from her she really believes she is the daughter of tasha yar\nsela could have been cloned\nwe should not discount jean luc picard yet he is human and humans have a way of showing up when you least expect them and now the conclusion\ni would speak with you\nit was duras father who betrayed our people to the romulans at khi tomer not mine\nthen i resign my commission as a starfleet officer\naft shields buckling\naft shields are gone we can not win we must withdraw\nwe are entering the stars corona we will reach the photosphere in thirty seconds\nshields failing outer hull temperature exceeding design limit captain\ntheyre closing on us\nyou drink with our enemies\nthe repairs to the heg hta are proceeding the port stabilisers\nit is my responsibility\nthere is no time for this we must make plans before those forces reach beta lanka l how can we oppose the duras when we continue to fight among ourselves\nstop it do we to fall upon ourselves like a pack of ferengi the enemy is the duras we are at war\nwe are at war gowron should forbid any challenges until we are victorious\na klingon should place the good of the empire above his own pride\nno\nwhat do you want\nyour family has never valued honour\nthen you should not have opposed gowron\nan era where honour has no meaning where klingons trade loyalties in darkrooms and where the empire is ruled from romulus\nno\ni know but it is not my way this boy has done me no harm and i will not kill him for the crimes of his family\nnono you gave me his life and i have spared it\nrequest permission to return to duty sir"
