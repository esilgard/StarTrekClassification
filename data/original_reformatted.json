    "episode 0": "i understand we picked up a distress signal\noh i concur with yours definitely\nwho wants a warm martini\nsometimes a man ll tell his bartender things hell never tell his doctor whats been on your mind chris the fight on rigel seven\nwas there anything you personally could have done to prevent it\nchris you set standards for yourself no one could meet you treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself and now you retired and you\nto the point of finally taking my advice a rest leave\nand do what\nah that sounds exciting ride out with a picnic lunch everyday\nyou an orion trader dealing in green animal women slaves\nnot for you a man either lives life as it happens to him meets it head on and licks it or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away\ntake your choice we both get the same two kinds of customers the living and the dying\nif they can spare you a moment id like to make my medical report\ntheir health is excellent almost too good\nit was a perfect illusion they had us seeing just what we wanted to see human beings who d survived with dignity and bravery everything entirely logical right down to the building of the camp the tattered clothing everything now lets be sure we understand the danger of this the inhabitants of this planet can read our minds they can create illusions out of a persons own thoughts memories and experiences even out of a persons own desires illusions just as real and solid as this tabletop and just as impossible to ignore\nmaybe it was its what i tried to explain in the briefing room their power of illusion is so great we cant be sure of anything we do anything we see\nhold on a minute\nyou look a hundred percent better\neve as in adam\nyes sir\nbut you wanted the reports by oh five hundred its oh five hundred now sir\nwe were the only ones transported\nleave him alone\npicked her for what i dont understand\noffspring as in children\ncaptain\nwhats happened to vina\nyes sir\nsiri was wondering just curious who would have been eve\nyes maam yes sir\nits a radio waves ir were passing through an old style distress signal\na ship in trouble making a forced landing sir that sit no other message\neleven survivors from crash gravity and oxygen within limits food and water obtainable but unless the message faded at that point sir\nsir\ncould that be an illusion too\nopen sir\nopen\nthe captain\ngeological lab report complete captain\nour reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere sir heavy with inert elements but well within safety limits\nzero point nine of earth\ndoctor theodore haskins american continent l nstitute\nthis is vina her parents are dead she was born almost as we crashed\nyou must for give her choice of words captain shes lived her whole life with a collection of aging scientists\ntheresa reason for our condition but weve had some doubt if earth is ready to learn the secret let the girls how you well accept your judgment\nthis is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so easily with a simulated message as you can read in its thoughts it is only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a simple illusion we placed in their minds\nyou will note the confusion as it reads our thought transmissions\nyou now see the primitive fear threat reaction the specimen is about to boast of his strength the weaponry of his vessel and soon next frustrated into a need to display physical prowess the creature will throw himself against the transparency\ndespite its frustration the creature appears more adaptable than our specimens from other planets we can soon begin the experiment\ni read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it fought to protect its life we will begin with this giving the specimen something more interesting to protect\nthe vial contains a nourishing protein complex\nif the form and the colour is not appealing it can appear as any food you wish to visualise\nto starve you overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment\nfrom a fable you once heard in childhood you will now consume the nourishment\nif you continue to disobey from deeper in your mind there are things even more unpleasant\nnow to the female\nas youve conjectured an earth vessel did crash on our planet but with only a single survivor\nwe repaired the survivors injuries and found the species interesting\nit became necessary to attract a mate\nthis is necessary in order to perpetuate the species\nwe wish our specimens to be happy in their new life\nwith the female now properly conditioned\nfirst an emotion of protectiveness now one of sympathy excellent\nsince you resist the present specimen you now have a selection\neach of the two new specimens has qualities in her favour the female you call number one has the superior mind and would produce highly intelligent children although she seems to lack emotion this is largely a pretence she has often has fantasies involving you\nthe other new arrival has considered you unreachable but now is realising this has changed the factors in her favour are youth and strength plus unusually strong female drives\nwrong thinking is punishable right thinking will be as quickly rewarded you will find it an effective combination\nyour ship release me orwell destroy it bridge\nas you see your attempt to escape accomplished nothing\nyou are now on the surface where we wished you to be with the female of your choice you will now begin carefully guided lives\nthat is your choice to help you reclaim the planets surface our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life\nsince our life span is many times yours we have time to evolve you into a society trained to serve as artisans technicians\nis this a deception do you intend to destroy yourselves\nwe had not believed this possible the customs and history of your race show a unique hatred of captivity even when its pleasant and benevolent you prefer death this makes you too violent and dangerous a species for our needs\nno other specimen has shown your adaptability you were our last hope\nyour race would learn our power of illusion and destroy itself too\nthis is the females true appearance\nit was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an honest one\nand more\nshe has an illusion and you have reality may you find your way as pleasant\ntheyre men theyre humans\nnice place you have here mister pike\nfunny how they are on this planet they actually like being taken advantage of suppose you had all of space to choose from and this was only one small sample\ntheyre men theyre humans\nno its something else theres still something out there\nevasive manoeuvres sir\nweve no ships or earth colonies that far out\nthen they could still be alive even after eighteen years\nyes sir whats that i didnt say there s anything wrong with me boyce\nall decks have acknowledged sir\nshes replacing your former yeoman sir\nof course sir\nlanding party come in\nquarters are being prepared sir have i permission to send out scouting and scientific parties now\ni didnt get that last message captain\nlanding party come in\nso we just thought we saw survivors there mister spock\nany estimate what they might want one of us for\nengineering deck will rig to transmit ships power well try blasting through that metal\ntake cover\nincrease to full power can you give us anymore\ndisengage the top of that knoll should have been sheared off the first second\nnow you all know the situation were hoping to transport down inside the talos ian community\nnothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out\ncaptain captain\nbut we were a party of six\nthey were fully charged when we left its dead i cant make a signal what is it\noffspring asin he sadam is that it\nwell shall we do a little time computation there was a vina listed on that expedition as an adult crewman now adding eighteen years to your age then\ncaptain\nthey kept us from seeing this too we cut through and never knew it captain\nits wrong to create a whole race of humans to live as slaves\ncaptain we have transporter control now\nisnt she coming with us\nyeoman youve delivered your report\nall decks show ready sir\nglistening green almost like secret dreams a bored ship captain might have\nwouldnt you say it was worth a mans soul\nsteady as we go\nthey were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this way\nif they survived the crash\nnot without any indication of survivors no continue to the vega colony and take care of our own sick and injured first you have the helm maintain present course\nthats right unless we get anything more positive on it it seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent id like to log the ships doctors opinion too\ngood im glad you do because were going to stop first at the vega colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also what the devil are you putting in there ice\nwhat makes you think i need one\nshouldnt it be my only yeoman and two others dead seven injured\nohi should have smelled trouble when i saw the swords and the armour instead of that i let myself get trapped in that deserted fortress and attacked by one of their warriors\nyou be tim tired you be tim tired of being responsible for two hundred and three lives im tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which is nt and whos going on the landing party and who doesnt and who lives and who dies boy ive had it phil\nto the point of considering resigning\nwell for one thing go home nice little town with fifty miles of parkland around it remember i told you i had two horses and we used to take some food and ride out all day\ni said thats one place i might go i might go into business on regulus or on the orion colony\nthe point is this isnt the only life available theres a whole galaxy of things to choose from\nnow youre beginning to talk like a doctor bartender\naddress inter craft\nthis is the captain our destination is the talos star group our timewarp factors even\nengage\nyeoman\ni thought i told you that when im on the bridge\nohi see thank you\nshe does a good job all right its just that i cant get used to having a woman on the bridge no offence lieutenant your e different of course\nspec tography\ngravity\nprep a landing party of six you feel up to it\nsorry number one with little information on this planet well have to leave the ships most experienced officer here covering us\ntheres no indication of problems down there but lets not take chances\ncaptain christopher pike united spaceship enterprise\nthe same old earth and youll see it very soon\nenterprise\nwell begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to you very shortly\nthats affirmative on the\ner affirmative on request landing party out\ni dont understand\ncan you hear me my name is christopher pike commander of the space vehicle enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this galaxy our intentions are peaceful can you understand me\nyour e not speaking yeti can hear you\nall right then telepathy you can read my mind i can read yours now unless you want my ship to consider capturing mean unfriendly act\nif you were in here wouldnt you test the strength of these walls too theres a way out of any cage and ill find it\nthis is rigel seven\ni was in a cage a cell in some kind of a zoo i must still be there\ntheyve reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere ive been\nits starting just as it happened two weeks ago except for you\nlonger hair different dress but it is you the one the survivors called vina or rather the image of vina but why you again why didnt they create a different girl\nbut its only a dream\nyou can tell my jailers i wont go along with it im not an animal performing for its supper\nwhy would an illusion be frightened\nwho are you you act as if this were really you\nwhy are you here\nare you real\nno no no thats not an answer ive never met you before never even imagined you\nwhat and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear\nso they can see how their specimen performs they want to see how i react is that it\nor do they do more than just watch me do they feel with me too\nyes yes you can please me you can tell me about them is there anyway i can keep them from probing my mind from using my thoughts against me does that frighten you does that mean there is a way\nsince your e not real theres not much point in continuing this conversation is there\nhow far can they control my mind\nperhaps\nbut they try to trick me with their illusions\ndid they ever live on the surface of this planet why did they go underground\nthats why its so barren up there vina the planets only now becoming able to support life again\nso the talos ians who came underground found life limited here and they concentrated on developing their mental power\nor sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me\nwhich means they had to have more than one of each animal\ntheyll need a pair of humans too where do they get intend to get the earth woman\nbut that was a bargain with something that didnt exist you said you werent real remember\nis the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals\nand if i prefer\nwhy not just put irresistible hunger in my mind because you cant can you you do have limitations dont you\nthats very interesting\nyou were startled werent you reading my mind then\nno lets stay on the first subject all i wanted for that moment was to get my hands around your neck\ndo primitive thoughts put up a block you cant read through\nall right all right lets talk about the girl you seem to be going out of your way to make her attractive to make me feel protective\nit seems more important to you now that i begin to accept her and like her\nassuming that salie why would you want me attracted to her so ill feel love in a husband wife relationship that would be necessary only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human community\nyou mean properly punished im the one who s not cooperating why dont you punish me\ntango you old devil you im sorry i dont have any sugar well they think of everything dont they\nthey read our minds very well home anything else i want if i cooperate is that it\nlook im sorry they punish you but we cant let them\nits funny its about twenty four hours ago i was telling the ships doctor how much i wanted something else not very different from what we have here an escape from reality life with no frustrations no responsibilities now that i have it i understand the doctors answer\nyou either live life bruises skinned knees and all or you turn your back on it and start dying the doctors going to be happy about one part at least he said i needed a rest\ni used to ride through here when i was a kid its not as pretty as some of the parkland around the big cities but thats mojave thats where i was born\nthese headaches they ll be hereditary you know would you wish them on a child or a whole group of children\nis it look first they made me protect you and then feel sympathy for you now we have these familiar surroundings and a comfortable husband wife relationship they dont need all this for just passion what they re after is respect and mutual dependence\nbut were not here neither of us were in a menagerie a cage\nback in my cage it seemed for a couple of minutes that our keeper couldnt read my thoughts do emotions like hate keeping hate in your mind does that block of four mind from them\nohno i dont hate you i can guess what it was like\nif they can read my mind then they know im attracted to you\ni was from the very first moment i saw you in the survivors camp\nvina\nthey dont work\ndont say anything im filling my mind with a picture of beating their huge misshapen heads to pulp thoughts so primitive they blackout everything else im filling my mind with hate\nill break out of this zoo somehow and get to you is your blood red like ours im going to find out\nall i want to do is get my hands on you can you read these thoughts images of hate killing\nyou ll find my thoughts more interesting thoughts so primitive you cant understand emotions so ugly\nno no dont help me i have to concentrate they cant read through hate\nnow you hold still or ill break your neck\nive had some samples of how good they are\nyou stop this illusion or ill twist your head off all right now you try one more illusion you try anything at all and ill break your neck\nim going to gamble your e too intelligent to kill for no reason at all\non the other hand ive got a reason im willing to bet youve created an illusion this laser is empty i think it just blasted a hole in that window and your e keep us from seeing it you want me to test my theory out on your head\nmake contact number one\ni want to contact our ship\nand start by burying you\nlook ill make a deal with you you and your life for the lives of these two earth women\ndo you understand what im saying you give me proof that our ship is all rights end these two back and ill stay with vina\nthe weapon is building up an overload a force chamber explosion you still have time to get underground well go on just to show you how primitive humans are talos ian you go with her\nwait\nand thats it no apologies you captured one of us threatened all of us\nbut wouldnt some form of trade mutual cooperation\nlets get back to the ship\nyoull give her back her illusion of beauty\nnono and i agreed with her reasons\noh i feel fine just fine\nyou recommended a rest a change of pace didnt you ive even been home does that make you happy\nyeoman\ni thought i told you that when im on the bridge i\noh oh yes the reports thank you\nas in

spock here were intercepting a followup message sir there are crash survivors on talos\npreliminary lab survey ready sir\nyes sir\nspock here\nthere is no survivors encampment number one this is all some sort of trap weve lost the captain do you read\nthe inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground and probably manufacture food and other needs down there our tests indicate the planet surface without considerably more vegetation or some animals simply too barren to support life\nexactly an illusion placed in our minds by this planets inhabitants\nthey may simply be studying the captain to find out how earth people are put together or it could be something more\nlook brains three times the size of ours if we start buzzing about down there were liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly\nten nine eight seven six five four three two one\nour circuits are beginning to heat well have to cease power\nweve

collecting all the information stored in this fly theyve decided to swat us\nmister spock here\nis earth all right\nit appears magistrate that the intelligence of the specimen is shockingly limited\nthousands of us are already probing the creatures thoughts magistrate we find excellent memory capacity\na curious species they have fantasies they hide even from themselves\ntheir method of storing records is crude and consumed much time are you prepared to assimilate it\nyour unsuitability has condemned the talos ian race to eventual death is this not sufficient\nall operating sir\nit

why arent we doing anything that entry may have stood up against hand lasers but we can transmit the ships power against it enough to blast half a continent\nits captain pike they ve got he needs help

micro records everything it doesnt make sense\nall power has come on mister spock the helm is answering to control\neve sir yes sir\nyou appear to be healthy and intelligent captain a prime specimen\ni think its time to show the captain our secret\nyou retired but dont worry youll feel much better soon dont you see it here and here\nyou will youre a perfect choice\ncome on we must hide ourselves come come hurry its deserted there ll be weapons and perhaps food\nplease we must hide ourselves\ncome on\nthe killer\nquick if you attack while its not looking\nyou have to kill him as you did here before\nit doesnt matter what you call this youll feel it thats what matters youll feel every moment of whatever happens to you please dont you know what hell do to us\nbecause thats the way you imagined me\ncareful\nits over\nto please you\nas real as you wish\nperhaps they made me out of dreams youve forgotten\ni have to wear something dont ii can wear whatever you wish be anything you wish\ndont you have a dream something youve always wanted very badly\nyou can have whatever dream you want i can become anything any woman youve ever imagined you can have anything you want in the whole universe let me please you\nyour e a fool\nperhaps if you asked me some questions i could answer\nif i tell you then will you pick some dream youve had and let me live it with you\nthey cant actually make you do anything you dont want to do\nand they can punish you when your e not cooperative you ll find out about that\nwar thousands of centuries ago\nbut they found its a trap like a narcotic because when dreams become more important than reality you give up travel building creating you even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors you just sit living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought record\nyour e better than a theatre to them they create the illusion for you they watch you react feel your emotions they have a whole collection of specimens descendants of life brought back long ago from all over this part of the galaxy\nplease\nyou said that if i answered questions\nim a woman as real and as human as you are were like adam and eve if we dont please dont punish me\nyou want some coffee dear i left the thermos hooked to my saddle\nhey your coffee is it good to be home\nhave you forgotten my headaches darling i get them when you talk strangely like this\nmy it turned out to be a lovely day didnt it\ni hope your e hungry these little white sandwiches are your mothers recipe for chicken tuna\nthis is a lovely place to rest\nis that supposed to be news to your wife your e home you can even stay if you want wouldnt it be nice showing your children where you once played\nfoolish\nthey say in the olden days all this was a desert blowing sand and cactus\nno pike i cant help either one of us if you wont give me a chance now you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic they couldnt repair the machines left by their ancestors is that why they want us to build a colony of slaves\nstop it dont you care what theyll do to us\nyes they cant read through primitive emotions but you cant keep it up for long enough ive tried they keep at you and at you year after year tricking and punishing and they won they own mei know you must hate me for that\nbut thats not enough dont you see they read my thoughts my feelings my dreams of what would be a perfect man thats why they picked you i cant help but love you and they expect you to feel the same way\nim beginning to see why none of this has worked for you youve been home and fighting a son rigel thats not new to you either a persons strongest dreams are about what he cant do yes a ships captain always having to be so form also decent and honest and proper you must wonder what it would be like to forget all that\nno let me finish\nits not fair you dont need them\nhow long can you block your thoughts a few minutes an hour how can that help\nhe doesnt need you hes already picked me\nnow theres a fine choice for intelligent offspring\nyour e no better choice they d have more luck crossing him with a computer\nits not fair i did what you asked\ndont hurt them they dont mean to be evil\nhes not bluffing captain with illusion they can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your ship\nwhat is that\nif if you all think its this important then i cant go either i suppose if they have one human being they might try again\nhe means that they cant use you youre free to go back to the ship\ni cant i cant go with you\nyou see why i cant go with you\nthey found me in the wreckage dying a lump of flesh they rebuilt me everything works but they had never seen a human they had no guide for putting me back together",
    "episode 1": "its quite warm here isnt it captains log additional entry since our mission was routine we had beamed down to the planet without suspicion we were unaware each member of the landing party was seeing a different woman a different nancy crater\nhow about that\nthe heroic captain and the intrepid doctor cross interstellar space to preserve our health your sense of duty is overwhelming now will you please go back where you came from and tell whoever issues your orders to leave me and my wife alone we need salt against the heat aside from that were doing very well thank

examination you can see that perhaps you d better take your man and\nill take care of the provisioning nancy\none might think that you had more important duties than harassing people captain\ncaptain you cant just beam down here and bully us and interfere with our work\npossibly at the other diggings we dont keep military logs\ncaptain considering the inescapable fact that you are a trespasser on my planet\nwe ve been here for almost five years if there were anything hostile here we would know about it wouldnt we\nand your esteemed physician can not explain our need for salt tablets\nnancy and

nancy very much few women like my nancy she lives in my dreams she walks and sings in them\nnot because of tricks it doesnt trick me it needs love as much as it needs salt when it killed nancy i

now as hell of a man unable to speak or move the only answer spock would give was on the hearing room screen how spock could do this he refused to explain but there before our eyes actual images from thirteen years ago of captain pike as he was when he commanded this vessel of spock in those days and of how the enterprise had become the first and only starship to visit talos four they had received a distress signal from that planet and discovered there still alive after many years the survivors of a missing vessel only to find it was all an illusion no survivors no encampment it was all a trap set by a race of beings who could make a man believe he was seeing anything they wished him to see and captain pike was gone a prisoner for some unknown purpose\nand the images we ve been seeing are\ndo you know what you redoing have you lost your mind\nthe court martial of mister spock has been convened in closed session despite all we can do images continue to be transmitted to us from talos four\nthe talos ians controlled his brain\nthen they care about the captain\nwhy just to maintain a supply of zoo specimens\nthat sv in a again as the green orion slavegirl\nstrange evidence from the past how the talos ians planning to breed a society of human slaves tempted captain pike with the earth woman they held in captivity and as she appeared to him in many forms each more exciting than the last pike was beginning to weaken\nwell mister spock\nyou keep talking about life mister spock a chance for life how as a prisoner caged a zoo specimen living the illusions that am use his keepers\nguilty as charged\ncommodore dont you think that\nmister spock even if regulations are explicit you could have come to me and explained\nyes\nchris do you want to go there mister spock would you care to take captain pike to the transporter room see him off\ner mister spock when you refinished please come back and see me i want to talk to you this regrettable tendency you ve been showing lately towards flagrant emotionalism\nthis is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so easily with a simulated message as you can read in its thoughts it is only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a simple illusion we placed in their minds\nyou will note the confusion as it reads our thought transmissions\nyou now see the primitive fear threat reaction the specimen is about to boast of his strength the weaponry of his vessel and soon next frustrated into a need to display physical prowess the creature will throw himself against the transparency\ndespite its frustration the creature appears more adaptable than our specimens from other planets we can soon begin the experiment\ni read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it fought to protect its life we will begin with this giving the specimen something more interesting to protect\nhow do you plead to the charge of unlawfully taking command\nof sabotaging the computers of this vessel and locking it on a course for planet talos four\nand of forcibly attempting to transport captain pike to that planet\nmister spock your e aware of the orders regarding any contact with talos four you have deliberately invited the death penalty\nstarfleet has ordered no contact with talos four they made no exceptions\nwhat is it why have they stopped the images\ni demand

concentrated on developing their mental power\nor sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me\nwhich means they had to have more than one of each animal\ntheyll need a pair of humans too where do they get intend to get the earth woman\nbut that was a bargain with something that didnt exist you said you werent real remember\nis the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals\nand if i prefer\nwhy not just put irresistible hunger in my mind because you cant can you you do have limitations dont you\nthats very interesting\nyou were startled werent you reading my mind then\nno lets stay on the first subject all i wanted for that moment was to get my hands around your neck\ndo primitive thoughts put up a block you cant read through\nall right all right lets talk about the girl you seem to be going out of your way to make her attractive to make me feel protective keeper this is necessary in order to perpetuate the species\nseems more important to you now that i begin to accept her and like her\nassuming that salie why would you want me attracted to her so ill feel love in a husband wife relationship that would be necessary only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human community\nyou mean properly punished im the one who s not cooperating why dont you punish me\ntango you old devil you u him sorry i dont have any sugar well they think of everything dont they\nthey read our minds very well home anything else i want if i cooperate is that it\nbut were not here neither of us were in a menagerie a cage\nback in my cage it seemed for a couple of minutes that our keeper couldnt read my thoughts do emotions like hate keeping hate in your mind does that block of four mind from them\nohno i dont hate you i can guess what it was like\nif they can read my mind then they know im attracted to you i was from the very first moment i saw you in the survivors camp you were like a wild little animal vin aim beginning to see why none of this has worked for you youve been home and fighting a son rigel thats not new to you either a persons strongest dreams are about what he cant do yes a ships captain always having to be so form also decent and honest and proper you must wonder what it would be like to forget all that\nvina\nthey dont work\ndont say anything im filling my mind with a picture of beating their huge misshapen heads to pulp thoughts so primitive they blackout everything else im filling my mind with hate\nill break out of this zoo somehow and get to you is your blood red like ours im going to find out\nall i want to do is get my hands on you can you read these thoughts images of hate killing\nyou ll find my thoughts more interesting thoughts so primitive you cant understand emotions so\nno no dont help me i have to concentrate they cant read through hate\nhold still or ill break your neck\nive had some samples of how good they are\nyou stop this illusion or ill twist your head off all right now you try one more illusion you try anything at all and ill break your neck\nim going to gamble your e too intelligent to kill for no reason at all on the other hand ive got a reason im willing to bet youve created an illusion this laser is empty i think it just blasted a hole in that window and your e keep us from seeing it you want me to test my theory out on your head\nmake contact number one\ni want to contact our ship\nand start by burying you\nlook ill make a deal with you you and your life for the lives of these two earth women you give me proof that our ship is all rights end these two back and ill stay with vina\nthe weapon is building up an overload a force chamber explosion you still have time to get underground well go on just to show you how primitive humans are talos ian you go with her\nwait\nand thats it no apologies you captured one of us threatened all of us\nbut wouldnt some form of trade mutual cooperation\nlets get back to the ship\nyoull give her back her illusion of beauty\nnono and i agreed with her reasons\nengage\nsir it just came on we cant shut the power off\nmister spock the system is coming on again\nguilty\nguilty\nguilty\nare coming from talos four sir\ncaptain jim please dont stop me dont let him stop me its your career and captain pikes life you must see the rest of the transmission\nyou have no choice sir im sorry the keeper has taken over control of our screen do you understand sir as you saw before captain pike had been knocked unconscious and captured by the talos ians\nthe inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground probably manufacture food and other needs down there our tests indicate the planet surface without considerably more vegetation or some animals simply too barren to support life\nexactly an illusion placed in our minds by this planets inhabitants\nif we start buzzing about down there were liable to find their mental powers so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly\na brilliant deduction by captain pike gentlemen yes he was still inside his cell but knowing that couldnt help him\nand could make him live any place anytime any situation they wished he would see taste suffer with the same reality as you gentlemen sitting there\nbecause they know that captain pike is fatigued we can reconvene later\nthey want him back alive sir\nif you ll be patient the answers to your questions\nmy answer to your question would be quite unbelievable siri regret well have to wait and see it there personal log stardate 30132 reconvening court martial of mister spock and the strangest trial evidence ever heard aboard a starship from the mysterious planet now only one hour ahead of us the story of captain pikes imprisonment there\nstanding by number one\nten nine

materialised inside solid rock\nthe women\ngentlemen a moment please\nsignal you want them to wait captain please its your life now at least a chance for life\nno captain theres more to it watch\ntalos controls the vessel now sir as they did thirteen years ago youve asked me why youll see the answer now\nmister spock here\nall decks prepare for hyperdrive\nask you to face the death penalty too one of us was enough captain\nthank you sir for both of us\ni see no reason to insult me siri believe ive been completely logical about the whole affair captain kirk keeper\nit appears magistrate that the intelligence of the specimen is shockingly limited\nthousands of us are already probing the creatures thoughts magistrate we find excellent memory capacity\ntheir method of storing records is crude and consumed much time are you prepared to assimilate it\nyour unsuitability has condemned the talos ian race to eventual death is this not sufficient\nnice place you have here mister pike\nwouldnt you say it was worth a mans soul\nits captain pike they ve got he needs help\nnow that entry may have stood up against hand lasers but we can transmit the ships power against it enough to blast half a continent\nall power has come on mister spock the helm is answering to control\nmessage from starbase eleven sir received images from talos four in view of historic importance of captain pike in space exploration general orders even prohibiting contact talos four is suspended this occasion no action contemplated against spock proceed as you think best signed mendez ji commodore starbase eleven\ncome on we must hide ourselves come come hurry its deserted there ll be weapons and perhaps food\nplease we must hide ourselves\ncome on\nthe kayla r\nquick if you attack while its not looking\nyou have to kill him as you did here before\nit doesnt matter what you call this youll feel it thats what matters youll feel every moment of what happens to you\nits over\nto please you\nas real as you wish\nperhaps they made me out of dreams youve forgotten\ni can wear whatever you wish be anything you wish\ndont you have a a dream something youve always wanted very badly\nyou can have whatever dream you want i can become anything any woman you youve ever imagined you can have anything you want in the whole universe let me please you\nyour e a fool\nperhaps if you asked me some questions i could answer\nif i tell you then will you pick some dream youve had and let me live it with you\nthey cant actually make you do anything you dont want to do\nan der they can punish you when your e not cooperative you ll find out about that\nwar thousands of centuries ago\nbut they found its a trap like a narcotic because when dreams become more important than reality you give up travel building creating you even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors you just sit living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought record\nyour e better than a theatre to them they create the illusion for you they watch you react feel your emotions they have a whole collection of specimens descendants of life brought back long ago from all over this part of the galaxy\nplease\nyou said that if i answered questions\nim a woman as real and as human as you are we are like adam and eve if we no please no dont punish me ill die\nyou want some coffee dear i left the thermos hooked to my saddle\nis it good to be home\nmy it turned out to be a lovely day didnt it youre home you can even stay if you want\nno pike i cant help either one of us if you wont give me a chance now you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic they couldnt repair the machines left by their ancestors is that why they want us to build a colony of slaves\nstop it dont you care what theyll do to us\nyes they cant read through primitive emotions but you cant keep it up for long enough ive tried they keep at you and at you year after year tricking and punishing and they won they own mei know you must hate me for that\nbut thats not enough dont you see they read my thoughts my feelings my dreams of what would be a perfect man thats why they picked you i cant help but love you and they expect you to feel the same way\nno let me finish\nits not fair you dont need them\nhow long can you block your thoughts a few minutes an hour how can that help\nhe doesnt need you hes already picked me\nnow theres a fine choice for intelligent offspring\nyour e no better choice they d have more luck crossing him with a computer\nits not fair i did what you asked\ndont hurt them they dont mean to be evil\nhes not bluffing captain with illusion they can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your ship\nwhat is that\nif if you all think its this important then i cant go either i suppose if they have one human being they might try again\nhe means that they cant use you youre free to go back to the ship\ni cant i cant go with you\nyou see why i cant go with you\nthey found me in the wreckage dying a lump of flesh they rebuilt me everything works but they had never seen a human they had no guide for

riley to engineering\nno thank you\nfull personal dossiers on the following names doctor thomas leighton anton kari dian lieutenant kevin riley and captain james t kirk\ncorrelate check their past histories report any item any past episode or experience they all have in common\ni will continue doctor according to our library banks it started on the earth colony of tarsus four when the food supply was attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed there were over eight thousand colonists and virtually no food and that was when governor kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law\nyou may not have heard it all kodos began to separate the colonists some would live be rationed whatever food was left the remainder would be immediately put to death apparently he had his own theories of eugenics\nperhaps not but he was certainly among the most ruthless to decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not using his own personal standards and then to implement his decision without mercy children watching their parents die whole families destroyed over four thousand people they died quickly without pain but they died relief arrived but too late to prevent the executions and kodos there never was a positive identification of his body\nhis history begins almost to the day where kodos disappeared\nhed better there were nine eyewitnesses who survived the massacre who d actually seen kodos with their own eyes jim kirk was one of them with the exception of riley and captain kirk every other eyewitness is dead and my library computer shows that wherever they were on earth on a colony or aboard ship the kari dian company of players was somewhere near when they died\nyou ve got to pull him through\nif he dies the only one who ll be able to identify

the moving position of our vessel a line of earth outpost stations constructed on asteroids they monitor the neutral zone established by treaty after the earth romulan conflict a century ago\nas you may recall from your histories this conflict was fought\nby our standards today with primitive atomic weapons and in primitive space vessels\nwhich allowed no quarter no captives nor was there even ship to ship visual communication therefore no human romulan orally has ever seen the other earth believes the romulans to be warlike cruel treacherous and only the romulans know what they think of earth the treaty set by subspace radio established this neutral zone entry into which by either side would constitute an act of war the treaty has been unbroken since that time captain\noutpost two

constructed on pulverised\nand showing on my sensors captain at least its still there\noutpost four disintegrated captain\ndisappeared interesting how they became visible for just a moment\ni have a blip on the motion sensor could be the intruder\ninvisibility is theoretically possible captain with selective bending of light but the power cost is enormous they may have solved that problem\nblip has changed its heading and in a very leisurely manoeuvre they may not be aware of us\nhis heading is now one eleven mark fourteen the exact heading a romulan would take jim for the neutral zone and

blood and i think this likely then attack becomes even more imperative\nit is for them doctor vulcan like earth had its aggressive colonising period savage even by earth standards and if romulans

believe they can build or do anything immediately\noh them well ieri was thinking about a little cabaret i know on rigel two an der there were these two girls in the chorus line and well here they are well after all i am onshore leave\noh yes so you are well girls i suppose you can turn something up\nits what the doctor ordered jim\nindeed we did mister spock\noh my paws and whiskers ill be late\nyou wont find all this so lovely if our report for the captain isnt ready when he asks for it which shouldnt be long\nyes sir weve completed the specimen survey\nthank you sir and sir i think you ll find doctor mccoy and mister sulu that way\ncalling doctor mccoy\nthis is all the volume i can get on this thing can tread you well either captains orders rendezvous at that glade where he first found you\nof all the crazy things remember what i was telling you a while ago about the early wars and funny air vehicles they used thats one of them\nnot unless it makes a strafing run\nthe way they used to attack people on the ground come on\nangela\nrodriguez to captain kirk\ncaptain a while ago i saw well birds a whole flock of them\ni like them fine sir but all our surveys showed kirk then offhand idsa your instruments are defective there are indeed life forms on this planet\nsir our surveys couldnt have been that wrong\naye aye sir\ndoctor doctor doctor mccoy\njim darling it is me it is ruth captains log stardate 30258 investigation of this increasingly unusual planet continues and we are seeing things that can not possibly exist yet they are undeniably real\nit doesnt matter none of that matters\nyou have to go\nyoull see me again if you want to\ndo what you have to do and ill be waiting\nthey should be sending up a report momentarily captain something wrong\ndoctor mccoy is correct captain after what this ship has been through in the last three months there is not a crewman aboard who is not in need of rest myself excepted of course\nnot necessary in my case captain on my planet to rest is to rest to cease using energy to me it is quite illogical to run up and down on green grass using energy instead of saving it\nvery well captain something i did come to discuss\ni picked this up from doctor mccoys log we have a crew member aboard whos showing signs of stress and fatigue reaction time down nine to twelve percent associational reading norm minus three\nhes becoming irritable and quarrelsome yet he refuses to take rest and rehabilitation now he has that right but weve found\njames kirk enjoy yourself captain its an interesting planet you ll find it quite pleasant very much like your earth\nscouts have detected no animals artefacts or force fields of any kind only peace sunshine and good air youll have no problems\ncaptain\nim getting strange readings from the planet surface captain some sort of power field down there\na highly sophisticated type of energy draining our power and increasing beginning to affect our communications\ncould be coming from beneath the planets surface patterns indicate some sort of industrial activity\nany chance these could be hallucinations\nthat sounds like a painful reality\nthere must be some logical explanation\nyour signal is very weak can you turn up your gain\ncaptain shall i beam down an armed party\nnecessary captain unable to contact you by communicator and the transporter is useless to us now as i told you before the res an unusual power field down here its soaking up all the energy at the source i calculated the rate of its growth and reasoned that i just might be able to transport one more person\nthis is not human skin tissue captain it more closely resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs much finer of course\nthis is definitely a mechanical contrivance it has the same basic cell structure as the plants here even the trees the grass\nim saying that these are all multicellular castings the plants the animals the people theyre all being manufactured\nall we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real thing just as pleasant or just as deadly\nat this point captain my analysis may not sound very scientific\nthere is one slight possibility very slim but nevertheless captain what were your thoughts just before you encountered the people you described\ncaptain wait\ndid you enjoy it captain\nwhich supports a theory ive been formulating\nyes somehow our thoughts are read these things are quickly manufactured and provided for us\nyes we must all control our thoughts\nthe force field we encountered is obviously underground manufacturing these things passages lead to the surface just for example when rodriguez thought of a tiger\ncaptain\nthe term is amusement park\nan old earth name for a place where people could go to see and do all sorts of fascinating things\ni tend to agree\ncaptain ill go back aboard ship and take over with all due respect to the young lady ive already had as much shore leave as i care for\ndid you enjoy your rest gentlemen\nmost illogical\nbeautiful beautiful no animals no people no worries just what the doctor ordered right doctor\ndo you think the captain will authorise shore leave here\nhed like it\nto get some cell structure records a blade of grass a bush a tree a flower petal with these we can tell the whole planets biology\nwhat is it whats the matter\nsee what i dont see anything what is it doc\ntarget shooting captain isnt it a beauty havent got anything like this in my collection\ni found it i know its a crazy coincidence but ive always wanted one like this found it lying right over there an old time police special and in beautiful condition hasnt been one like this made in a couple of centuries\nit fires lead pellets propelled by expanding gases from a chemical explosion\ncaptain take cover theresa samurai after me\ni mean there was captain you ve got to believe me\ngot a call a few minutes ago rodriguez said you were rendezvous ing back at the glade\nthats not all sos my phaser\nyes sir look someone beaming down from the bridge\nwere stranded down here captain\ncaptain captain\nyou d better have a look at this sir i dont understand\nits like a dummy captain it couldnt be alive\nstill operating sir\ncaptain\nhes gone dragged off\nsir\nplayas advanced as you obviously are and you still play\ndoes it always have to be work with you theres so much loveliness\nwhat is it\ncan it hurt us\na what\nyou need sleep captain if its not out of line\nsir i dont see your name in any of the shore parties\naye aye sir\nit is beautiful so lovely and restful i mean affirmative captain\nwhere is mister sulu\ndoctor mccoys rabbit sir he must have gone through here\ni dont know i mean i do know i was following the tracks and there he was\nhim\nhe had a cloak sir and a dagger with jewels on it\ncaptain i know it sounds incredible but i did not imagine it anymore than i imagined he did this\nyes yes it was so sort of storybook walking around here and i was thinking all a girl needs is don juan just daydreaming the way you would about someone you d like to meet\nhe ran after him\na little but i wouldnt want to be alone here\nthats just it its almost too beautiful i was thinking even before my tunic was torn that in a place like this a girl should be oh lets see now a girl should be dressed like a fairy tale princess with lots of floaty stuff and at all hat with a veil\nis that a promise doctor\noh doctor theyre lovely look at me doctor a lady to be protected and fought for a princess of the blood royale\ndoctor im afraid\nall right but you stay right there dont peek\ntheres no one here\ndont talk like that\nhes dead captains log supplemental all contact with the enterprise has been lost were trapped here our ships surgeon my personal friend is dead were certain now that whatever were facing is terribly real\nits my fault it never would have happened its my fault\nit is it is im to blame\naye aye sir\nthe black knight too\nand how do you explain them\nand so aml\naye aye captain\ndoctor mccoy calling from the planet captain\naye aye sir\nbridge\nnegative captain theyre just about to start\naye aye sir\nthis is the bridge captain our power systems have just come back in do you require assistance\naye aye sir\nsir",

all\ntry and get me a fix on the galileo\nthat thing out there has ionized this complete sector none of our instruments work at least four complete solar systems in the immediate vicinity and out

virtually no chance of it being seen yet you did it anyhow that would seem to me to be an act of desperation\nnow we all know and im sure the doctor will agree with me that desperation is a highly emotional state of mind how does your well known logic explain that\ni see you mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional outburst\nyour e not going to admit that for the first time in your life you committed a purely human emotional act\nmister spock your e a stubborn man\nthree points even siri\nsir this indicators gone crazy\ni cant sir nothing happens\naye aye sir\nwhat is it\nno its from back there\nlets get out of here\nwere being drawn right into it\nyou all right\nscotty boma\nyeoman\nups y daisy\nwhat happened\npartial pressure of oxygen seventy millimetres of mercury nitrogen one forty breathable if your e not running in competition\ntraces of argonne on krypton all in acceptable quantities however i wouldnt recommend this place as a summer resort\nwhat do you think our chances are of contacting the enterprise\nbut they ll be looking for us\nthen you dont think they ll find us\nwell i cant say much for the circumstances but at least its your big chance\ncommando hi know you mister spock youve never voiced it but youve always thought that logic was the best basis on which to build command ami right\nitll take more than logic to get us out of this\nor the equivalent weight in equipment\nmister spock life and death are seldom logical\nnot his head mister boma his heart his heart\nthis should save us at least fifty pounds mister spock\ni cant believe your e serious about leaving someone behind now whatever it is thats out there\nim not talking about rationality\nmister spock thats your place\nnow look we may all die here at least let us die like men not machines\nmister spock some things happening outside\nwhat do those super sensitive ears make of that mister spock\nseems logical to me\nyes\nright\ni hope not scotty has an idea\ntrouble is they happen to be our only defence\njust where are you going\ni dont know hell risk his neck locating gaetano and if he finds him he s just as liable to order him to stay behind you tell me\nwell it wont unless we get these phasers back\nwell mister spock they didnt stay frightened very long did they\nyou mean they should have respected us\nmister spock respect is a rational process did it ever occur to you they might react emotionally with anger\nthey were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling you might as well admit it mister spock your precious logic brought them down on us\nstudying us mister spock they seem to learn rather quickly\nand youve brought our furry friends down on us\nhow much longer mister scott\nthat wont be long enough\nit must ve worked\nmister boma\ndont be a fool mister spock we couldnt leave you out there\nwe got off\nmister spock remind me to tell you that im sick and tired of your logic\nafter that\nwell at least i lived long enough to hear that is there anything we can do\nwell mister spock so ends your first command\nhow long have we got now scotty\nit may be the last action youll ever take mister spock but it was all human\nthats exactly what i mean\nreadings normal acceleration normal phase one separation normal\nmister spock radiation is increasing\nyes i just got a little bump on the head\nthank you\nof course mister spock\nwe should be able to scrape up another hundred pounds\nif we knew more about them\ndid you find them\nbut what if the creatures attack again\nwhy havent they done anything\nwe could use a little inspiration\nenterprise this is galileo come in please enterprise nothing sir just ionic interference\nwere moving\ni dont want to die up here\nwhat happened\nits getting hot\nwhat a mess\nyou dont really expect to get an answer do you\nlogical\nvery bad mister spock\nweve lost a great deal of fuel we have no chance at all to reach escape velocity and if we ever hope to make orbit well have to lighten our load by at least five hundred pounds\naye you could put it that way\nits too delicate it may not be able to take the pressure as it is\nif you ll give me a hand with this conduit\npressures dropping were losing everything\none of the lines gave the strain of coming through the atmosphere and the added load when we tried to bypass yes thats done it we have no fuel\nwe have no fuel what alternatives\nits dangerous but it might work\ni can adjust the main reactor to function with a substitute fuel supply\naye we do our phasers i can adapt them and use their energy itll take time but its possible\naye\nif i can get a full load we should be able to achieve orbit with all hands not that we can maintain it long\naye aye sir\nanother hour maybe two\ndoctor a phaser can only drain so fast\nyou ve got your hands full captains log stardate 28231our landing parties are on the surface of taurus two we continue to hope instruments are slowly returning to an operable condition as the ion storm slowly disperses on the ship we can only wait helplessly\ntheyre in good shape but they wont lift us off if thats what your e getting at\nthat they will mister spock\nready mister spock\nida rent use any more not and be sure of ignition\naye\nthats enough\nthats it\nif we shed every ounce we might be able to achieve orbit\na few hours no longer but if we time it right we can cut out of orbit and save enough fuel for a controlled reentry\nwe have very few alternatives mister spock\nmay be eight minutes if the weights right\naye aye sir\nwe should be moving but were not\nwhat are you doing\nwell never be able to hold orbit\nno mister spock\nfifteen pounds psi approximately enough for one orbit sir\ntapping our boosters ended our last chance for a soft landing\nmister spock you said a while ago that there were always alternatives\norbit attitude mister spock with our present fuel that gives us about forty five minutes\nmister spock\nhe jettisoned the fuel and ignited it\nthe orbit ll start decaying as soon as the fuels exhausted say six minutes\na distress signal its like sending up a flare mister spock that was a good gamble perhaps it was worth it\norbit decaying mister spock ten seconds to atmosphere\npower up all instruments activated all readings normal all go\nposition\nmake up your mind please mister latimer\nconsiderably mister boma\nstop forward momentum mister latimer\ngalileo to enterprise galileo to enterprise come in please\ngalileo to enterprise galileo to enterprise we are out of control being pulled directly into the heart of murasaki three one two being hit by violent radiation on outer hull course three point two five\nid say your evaluation is reasonable mister boma\npicturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits mister scott i think you ll find your work is cut out for you galileo to enterprise galileo to enterprise come in please\ni expect nothing mister scott it is merely logical to try all the alternatives doctor mccoy a reading on the atmosphere please\njust the facts doctor\nthankyou for your opinion it will be duly noted your e recording this yeoman\nmister scott if you ll make a survey of the damage please\ngentlemen i think we should move outside make room for mister scott to do his work mister latimer mister gaetano youll army ourselves and scout out the area keeping in visual contact with the ship\nunder present conditions extremely poor\nif the ionisation effect is as widespread as i believe it is doctor they ll be searching for us without instrumentation by visual contact only on those terms this is a very large planet\nnot as long as were grounded we may be here for a very long time doctor\nmy big chance for what doctor\ni am a logical man doctor\nperhaps doctor but i know of no better way to begin i realise command does have its fascinations even under circumstances such as these but in either enjoy the idea of command no rami frightened of it it simply exists and i will do whatever logically needs to be done excuse me\nin what way\nthe weight of three grown men\ndoctor mccoy with very few exceptions we use virtually every piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit theres very little excess weight except among the passengers\nunless the situation changes radically yes\nas commanding officer the choice will be mine\na very quaint idea mister boma but i do believe im better qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots\nmy choice will be a logical one arrived at through logical means\nbut attaining a desired goal always is doctor now gentlemen i suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in the event weve overlooked any minor damage\ncome on boma\nwhat was it\nnothing there\ni dont doubt your word\nfolsom point\ntheres a remarkable resemblance to the folsom point discovered in 1925old world calendar new mexico north america a bit more crude about the shaft i believe not very efficient\nami in error mister boma\nthen what mister boma\nmy concern for the dead will not bring him back to life mister boma\nbringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our repair efforts if you need assistance i\nperhaps if you were to channel the second auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve\nexcellent doctor\nwhich would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds overweight\nit is more rational to sacrifice one life than six doctor\nyou might be wise to start\nfor what\nmister boma were working against time\ndoctor perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion\nmy place is here if you please doctor\nby dealing with first things first i hope to increase our chances of staying alive well mister scott\nwhat happened\nthat would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind consider the alternatives mister scott\nmister scott there are always alternatives\nwood rubbing on some kind of leather\nnot a tribal culture their artefacts are too primitive more likely a loose association of some sort\nhow mister boma\nim frequently appalled by the low regard you earth men have for life\nmister boma\ndoctor mccoy\nit does indeed it seems logical to me also but to take life indiscriminately\ni am not interested in the opinion of the majority mister gaetano components must be weighed our danger to ourselves as well as our duties to other life forms friendly or not theres a third course\ni think not doctor mccoy\nyou and yeoman mears return to the ship assist mister scott in any way possible well be back shortly\ngentlemen youll follow my orders to the letter firing only when so instructed and at my designated targets\nwell fire to frighten mister gaetano not to kill\ni am in command mister gaetano the orders and the responsibility will be mine follow me\ni hear them theyre directly ahead of us several i believe direct your phasers to two oclock and tote no clock\nyes i know but fortunately im giving the orders take aim please and fire when i give a signal\nfire ceasefire they should think twice before bothering us again\nit was not necessary fear will do for us what needs to be done mister boma you will return with me to the galileo mister gaetano you remain on guard here keep in contact with the ship\nyes we found them they wont bother us again\ngo mister scott\nthats all very well but we dont have a substitute supply\nthey would also seem to be our only hope\nyeoman your phaser\nthey wont attack for at least several hours by then with luck well be gone\nwe dont have to maintain it very long mister scott in less than twenty four hours the enterprise will be forced to abandon its search in order to make a rendezvous if we cant maintain orbit after that time it wont make any difference if we burn up in a decaying orbit or die here on the planets surface we shall surely die doctor your phaser go to work mister scott\ntake this back to mister scott for conversion please doctor\nand give this to mister scott in the event i dont return\ni have a certain scientific curiosity about whats become of mister gaetano return to the ship please\nmost illogical reaction we demonstrated our superior weapons they should have fled\nof course\ndoctor i am not responsible for their unpredictability\ntheyre studying us for the moment\nmy opinion mister boma\nseal the windows\nmister boma your tone is increasingly hostile\ncurious most illogical\nstrange step by step i have made the correct and logical decisions and yet two men have died\ni do seem to have miscalculated regarding them and inculcated resentment on your parts the sum of the parts can not be greater than the whole a little less analysis and more action thats what we need mister spock\nhow much longer mister scott\nmister scott how much power do we have left in the ships batteries\nwill they electrify the exterior of this ship\nget to the centre of the ship dont touch the plates be sure your e insulated standby are you ready scott\nall right go again again\ni believe weve used enough mister scott i suggest you continue draining the phasers\nfor the moment\nthe moment they discover theyre not seriously hurt they ll be back meanwhile please check the aft compartment see if there s anything you can unload to lighten the ship\nit will of course have to be left behind\ni wouldnt recommend it the creatures wont be far away\nit would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril\ngentlemen all right mister boma youll have your burial provided the creatures will permit it\nhow about weight\nand how long can we hold it\nto land here again not a very attractive possibility\ndoctor mccoy mister boma when can we liftoff scott\ngentlemen the ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes you have that long to bury mister gaetano now it appears to be clear outside at least for the moment ill assist you hurry\nget into the ship immediate liftoff\nno go back liftoff go back no\nall right all right gogo gogo\ngo scott\ni told you to lift off\nget us off scott\nquite right mister scott theres somebody holding us down all systems are go but were not moving\nour boosters\nwould you rather stay here\nmay i remind you we have yet to achieve orbit nor can we maintain it long an hour from now we may be right back where we started from\ngentlemen by coming after me you may well have destroyed what slim chance you had for survival the logical thing for you to have done was to have left me behind\nthat is a most illogical attitude orbit in one minute mister scott fuel status\nit is the usual end of a decaying orbit\ninfinitely preferable to the kind of death wed be granted on the planets surface i should think\ndid li may have been mistaken\nthe enterprise is surely on course for mak us three by now if or one do not believe in angels\nyes my first command\ngalileo to enterprise galileo to enterprise come in please galileo to enterprise come in please\nperhaps mister boma\nno one out there to see it\ntotally illogical there was no chance\ncaptain\nquite correct captain\nquite simply captain i examined the problem from all angles and it was plainly hopeless logic informed me that under the circumstances the only possible action would have to be one of desperation logical decision logically arrived at\nwell i wouldnt put

deposits but no weapons in the conventional sense still i need to find one bare handed against the gorn i have no chance\na large deposit of diamonds on the surface perhaps the hardest substance known in the universe beautifully crystallized and pointed but too small to be useful as a weapon an incredible fortune in stones yeti would trade them all for a hand phaser or a good solid club yet the metro ns said there would be weapons if i could find them where what kind\nthis may be my last entry i am almost exhausted unless i find the weapon the metron mentioned i have very little time left native sulphur diamonds this place is a mineralogists dream yet there is something about sulphur something very old something if only i could remember\nwho is this theme tron\nall right what do you want\nlike you were at cestus three\nyou butchered helpless human beings\nnono i wont kill you maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost\nno i wont kill him do you hear you ll have to get your entertainment someplace else\nyour e a metron\nyou seem more like a boy\nhow\nwhat happened to the gorn\nno that wont be necessary we can talk may be reach an agreement\ni dont know i dont know all right everybody back to your posts lets get out of here\nmister sulu\ndont try and figure it out mister sulu just plot a course for us back to cestus three\nwere a most promising species mister spock as predators go did you know that\ni dont not anymore and may be in a thousand years or so well be able to prove it never mind mister spock it doesnt make much sense to me either take us back to where were supposed to be mister sulu warp factor one\nscanners reported a ship approaching we get them now and then they re all welcome to use our facilities you know that\nthey came in space normal speed using our regular approach route but they knocked out our phaser batteries with their first salvo from the non we were helpless we were nt expecting anything why should we we didnt have anything anyone would want\nthey poured it on like like phasers only worse whatever they were using i tried to signal them we called up tried to surrender we had women and children i told them that i begged them they wouldnt listen they didnt let up for a moment\nthey hit usa full day before you got there captain no messages came from us captain why did they do it why why did they do it there has to be a reason there has to be a reason\ni wonder if he brought his personal chef along with him to cestus three\nhow well we both know that\nspock isnt it enough the commodore is famous for his hospitality if or one could use a good non reconstituted meal\nyou bet your pointed ears i am ready whenever you are captain\ncaptain over there careful careful shock radiation burns internal injuries for certain\ncareful careful shock radiation burns internal injuries for certain hes in a bad way captain\nhell be dead in half an hour if we dont get him some decent

our weapons its just in conceivable that we are immobilised\nwe appeal to you in the name of civilisation put a stop to this\nif there were only some way we could contact him\nso\ncan that be true was cestus three an intrusion on their space\nthen we could be in the wrong\nthe gorn simply might have been trying to protect themselves\nwhat is it spock spock an invention doctor first potassium nitrate and now if he can find some sulphur and a charcoal depositor ordinary coal\nwhat she doing spock diamonds the hardest known substance impelled by sufficient force they would make formidable projectiles\nwhat force\ncan he do it\nwe are the metro ns you are one of two crafts which have come into our space on a mission of violence this is not permissible yet we have analysed you and have

planet with a suitable atmosphere you will be taken there as will the captain of the gorn ship which you have been pursuing there you will settle your dispute\nyou will be provided with a recording translating device in hopes that a chronicle of this contest will serve to dissuade others of your kind from entering our system but you will not be permitted to communicate with your ship you will each be totally alone\nit is you who are interfering we are simply putting a stop to it the place we have prepared for you contains sufficient elements for either of you to construct weapons lethal enough to destroy the other which seems to be your intention the winner of the contest will be permitted to go his way unharmed the loser along with his ship shall be destroyed in the interests of peace the contest will be one of ingenuity against ingenuity brute strength against brute strength the results will be final\nthere will be no discussion it is done\nwe are the metro ns your captain is losing his battle we would suggest you make whatever memorial arrangements if any which are customary in your culture we believe you have very little time left\nyour violent intent and actions demonstrate that you are not civilised however we are not without compassion it is possible you may have feelings toward your captain so that you will be able to prepare yourself we will allow you to see and hear what is now transpiring\ndoes my appearance surprise you captain\ni am approximately fifteen hundred of your earth years old you surprise me captain\nby sparing your helpless enemy who surely would have destroyed you you demonstrated the advanced trait of mercy something we hardly expected we feel there may be hope for your kind therefore you will not be destroyed it would not be civilised\nvery good captain there is hope for you perhaps in several thousand years your people and mine shall meet to reach an agreement you are still half savage but there is hope we will contact

completely broken up captain shall we turn off the tractor beam\nneither have i\ncaptain\nweve achieved a stable orbit out of earths atmosphere our deflectors are operative enough to prevent our being picked up again as a ufo and mister scott wishes to speak to you about the engines\ncaptain christopher\nwe can not return him to earth captain he already knows too much about us and is learning more i do not specifically refer to captain christopher but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain certain knowledge of mans future such a man could manipulate key industries stocks and even nations and in so doing change what must be and if it is changed captain you andi and all that we know might not even exist\nyes sir captains quarters kirk\ni have investigated it captain to correct the fault will require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of three weeks at a starbase\nit also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle\nwe put in at cygnet fourteen for general repair and maintenance cygnet fourteen is a planet dominated by women they seemed to feel the ships computer system lacked a personality they gave it one female of course\ni have run a computer check on all historical tapes they show no record of any relevant contribution by john christopher\nbridge to captain kirk\nhave some new information regarding captain christopher important i see you both immediately\nyes sir bridge out\ncrude methods but effective\ni made an error in my computations\ni find that we must return captain christopher to earth after all\npoor choice of words on my part i neglected in my initial run through to correlate the possible contributions by offspring i find after running across check on that factor that your son colonel shaun geoffrey christopher headed or will head the first successful earth saturn probe which is a rather significant\nthe doctor is correct unless we return captain christopher to earth there will be no colonel shaun geoffrey christopher to go to saturn\nacknowledging that we must return captain christopher there are several problems prime of which is the explanation of his return we tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crush edit it crashed in an open section of southern nebraska\nand captain christopher himself complicated the matter\ncaptain our tractor beam caught and crushed an air force plane it ll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine ufo possibly alien definitely destructive\na theory a reverse application of what happened to us logically it could work also logically there are a hundred variables any one of which could put us in a worse position than were in now\nnot at all youll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw a ufo\nfifteen minutes twenty eight seconds\nit is a fact doctor that prowling by stealth is more time consuming than a direct approach in our case\ni am\nyou may be correct doctor open communicator channel\nbeam up immediately\nwell know in a moment doctor\nspock here are you all right captain\ni dont believe there ll be trouble in that respect captain\nour guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is\nyour decision to beam up was quite correct mister sulu\nspock here\ndo so now engineer well need all power to test our theory\npoor photography\ni am aware of that doctor this is the first officer captain christopher to the briefing room\nquite logical captain can you give us the coordinates to be am down a landing party near those interrogation rooms\ni cant do that captain\nmister sulu you and captain christopher will be am down with me the captain will provide the coordinates for the transporter chief\none for you one for me set them on heavy stun force\nin fact i do but only to a certain point\nenergise\ndont you find that painful captain\nhe knew the exact beam down coordinates for this section of the base it was necessary to bring him along\ni suspected he might not wish to return with us\nmister scott and i both agree that the only possible solution is the slingshot effect like the one that put us here my computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun seek out its magnetic attraction then pull away at full power the whiplash will propel us into another timewarp\nlogically as we move faster and faster toward the sun well begin to move backward in time well actually go back beyond yesterday beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky then breaking free will shoot us forward in time and well transport you back before any of this happened\nsince

afraid so\ni have no objections sir\ni do sir\nnot guilty\nyes sir there was\nfirstly i am at a loss to explain the errors in the extract from the computer log we were in an ion storm everyone here in this court knows the dangers involved i was in command the decisions were mine no one else s charges of malice have been raised there was no malice lieutenant commander finney was a member of my crew and thats exactly the way he was treated it has been suggested that i panicked on the bridge and jettisoned the ion pod prematurely that is not so youve heard some of the details of my record this was not my first crisis it was one of many during it i did what my experience and training required me to do i took the proper steps in the proper order i did exactly what had to be done exactly when it should have been done\ngiven the same circumstances i would do the same thing without hesitation because the steps i took in the order i took them were absolutely necessary if i were to save my ship and nothing is more important than my ship\nwell need somebody in the pod for readings\npost him\nstandby on alert status mister spock\nwarp factor one mister hanson\ntie in\nmake it fast beni may have to go to red alert\nhold our course mister hanson\nengineering then ion pod\none third more thrust\nstandby to get out of there ben\nsteady as she goes mister hanson\nbut thats not the way it happened captains log stardate 29499 the evidence presented by the visual playback to my general court martial was damning i suspect even my attorney has begun to doubt me\nare you suggesting that i did\ntwo days ago i wouldve staked anything on my judgment\ni spent my whole life training for decisions just like that one my whole life is it possible that when the moment came noi know what i did you can pull out if you want to\nkirk here\nill tell you what you found nothing right\nnot bitter enough to forget to thankyou for your efforts\nno its not all bad mister spock who knows you may be able to be at your next captain at chess kirk out\njamie this is lieutenant commander finney s daughter\nits too late for that jamie but im glad you dont blame me anymore for what happened\ndont say anymore\ni know and i thankyou i have to go and change you ready\ni instituted a phase one search\nits a painstaking thorough attempt in and around the ship to find a man who s presumably injured and unable to respond\ni beg your pardon\nyes\npossibly\ngentlemen for the purposes of this experiment it ll be necessary for all personnel except for members of the court and the command crew to leave the ship i am ordering all others to report to the transporter room\nour impulse engines have been shut down well maintain orbit by momentum\nwe hope to be finished long before that\nready mister spock\ngentlemen this computer has an auditory sensor it can in effect hear sounds by installing a booster we can increase that capability on the order of one to the fourth power the computer should bring us every sound occurring on the ship\ndoctor mccoy all right mister spock\nturn it down a little gentlemen that sound is caused by the heart beats of all the people onboard the ship doctor mccoy will use this white sound device to mask out each persons heartbeat so that it will be eliminated from the sounds we are hearing\nthats all of us except for crewman in the transporter room mister spock eliminate his heart beat that accounts for everyone\nseal off b deck sections 18ythrough23d\nit would seem so commodore this is my problem id appreciate it if no one left the bridge\nsam cogley had gone ashore to bring jamie finney on board we felt jamies presence would make finney easier to handle in the event finney really were alive\nben\nben finney\nben where are you\nim glad you re alive\nben ben its not too late we can help you\nput the phaser down ben\nwhat about my ship\nmister spock whats our orbit status\nben why kill innocent people\ni logged the mistake ben blame me not them\nits not too late you can be helped but if you kill those people\nis jamie included in that deal\nshes onboard by now yes shes on board\nbeaten and sobbing finney told me where he had sabotaged the prime energy circuits\nthe damage hed caused was considerable but not irreparable with luck i would be able to effect repairs before our orbit decayed completely\nat the risk of sounding like a mystic that depends on the stars\ni didnt have much of a chance to thank him\ni wouldnt be a bit surprised\nlets try see no change discipline goes on\ngoodbye are el better luck next time\nshes a very good lawyer\nand when the orbit decays\ncome on jim lets go\njim\nif you have any doubt that was indeed captain james kirk of the enterprise\nin these trying times one of the few doctor leonard mccoy and you\nall of my old friends look like doctors all of his look like you well you might as well join me for a drink with this inquiry coming up hes going to need all the friends he can get\ni know something about it\nits possible\nhe could have\nno\nwait a minute i dont quite follow you\nwell yes i suppose it could happen\nnot captain kirk\nbut he s not that kind of a man\nyes its possible\nwell i had to see it to believe it\ntheyre about to lop off the captains professional head and your e sitting here playing chess with the computer\nmister spock your e the most coldblooded man ive ever known\nthats impossible\nso you tested the programme bank\nwell why are you just sitting there\nfirst the captain mister spock\nand lastly myself\nindeed she is back to the episode

lightly\nare you thats not what the rumours indicate\njim this could ruin you will you take some advice\nthe prosecution will build its case on the basis of kirk versus the computer now if your attorney tries to defend on that basis you wont have a chance\nthats up to your attorney and thats why he s got to be a good one\nno im busy\njim be serious your e not an ordinary human your e a starship captain and youve stepped into scandal if there s any way they can do it theyll slap you down hard and permanently for the good of the service\nsamuel t cogley attorney at law if anyone can save you he can hell be paying you a visit jim ive got to go\nbecause jim kirk my dear old love i am the prosecution and i have to do my very best to have you slapped down hard broken out of the service in disgrace\ni call mister spock\nmister spock as a first officer you know a great deal about computers dont you\nit is possible for a computer to malfunction is it not\ndo you know of any malfunction which has caused an inaccuracy in the enterprise computer\nthat answer is based on your mechanical survey of the enterprise computer ordered by the defendant prior to this trial is it not\nnow the stardate\nwhy do you say that\nin other words it reports that captain kirk was reacting to an extreme emergency that did not then exist\nis it were you watching him the exact moment he pressed the jettison button\nthen how can you dispute the finding of the log\noh on what do you base that statement\nplease instruct the witness not to speculate\ni do not see what that has to\nin your opinion\nthank you your witness mister cogley\ni now call the personnel officer for the enterprise\nin the course of your duties as personnel officer of the enterprise you would be familiar with the service records of all aboard\nwith reference to records officer finney was there in his service record a reported disciplinary action for failure to close a circuit\nwas the charge in that instance based upon a log entry by the officer who relieved him\nand who was that officer\nlouder please for the court\nnow the captain kirk who sits in this courtroom\nthank you do you wish to cross examine mister cogley\ni now call doctor mccoy to the stand\ndoctor you are on the record an expert in psychology especially space psychology patterns which develop in the close quarters of a ship during long voyages in deep space\nyou have just heard the testimony of your own personnel officer that it was an action of the then ensign kirk which placed an un erasable blot on the record of the then lieutenant finney psychologically doctor is it possible that lieutenant finney blamed kirk for the incident\nhe could have hated kirk down through the years blamed him for being passed over for promotion blamed him for never being given a command of his own correct\nnow let us hypothesise doctor is it normal for a person to return affection for hatred\ndo we not tend to at first resent and then actively dislike the person who hates us\nhypothetically would not captain smith begin to hate lieutenant commander jones once he learned that lieutenant commander jones hated and detested him\nthen i ask you is it not possible that captain kirk became aware of lieutenant commander finney s hatred toward him and perhaps even involuntarily began to reciprocate\nany normal human doctor is it possible\nis it theoretically possible doctor\nthank you your witness mister cogley\nmay it please the court\nthe prosecution concedes the inestimable record of captain kirk\nthank you\nthe prosecution does not wish to dishonour this man but facts are facts i must invite the attention of the court and captain kirk to this visual extract from the enterprise computer log playback what you are about to see is precisely what took place on the enterprise bridge during the ion storm\nreverse stop go forward with magnification on the panel freeze that captain kirk is now signalling a yellow alert go forward normal view\nfreeze that if the court will notice the log plainly shows the defendants finger pressing the jettison button the condition signal reads yellow alert not red alert but simply yellow alert when the pod containing lieutenant commander finney was jettisoned the emergency did not as yet exist\nsir the prosecution rests\nobjection counsel for the defence has rested his case\nmister cogley is well known for his theatrics\nyour honour that is ridiculous we produced the witnesses in court my learned opponent had the opportunity to see them cross examine them\ni protest your honour\nobject the witness would be making a conclusion\nwhat does that mean\nabsolutely no objection sir\nhow long will it be this time before i see you again\nsam cogley asked me to give you something special its not a first edition just a books am says that makes it special\nhes busy on a case hes defending ben finney he says hell win\ndo you think it would cause a complete breakdown of discipline if a lowly lieutenant kissed a starship captain on the bridge of his ship\nand so must the enterprise goodbye jim\ni had pretty good luck this time i lost didnt l\ncaptain i believe i\nmiss finney come with me please\ni know all about them\naffirmative\nnegative\naffirmative\nbut the computer is inaccurate nevertheless\nit reports that the jettison button was pressed before the red alert\nand that is impossible\nnoi was occupied the ship was already on yellow alert\ni do not dispute i time rely state that it is wrong\ni know the captain he is in\nlieutenant i am half vulcan ian vulcan ians do not speculate i speak from pure logic if i let go of a hammer on a planet that has a positive gravity i need not see it fall to know that it has in fact fallen\ngentlemen human beings have characteristics just as inanimate objects do it is impossible for captain kirk to act out of panic or malice it is not his nature\nyes in my opinion\nmister finney is top of duty roster captain\nattention commander finney report to pod for reading onion plates\nofficer posted captain\nacknowledged\ncaptain\nive run a complete mega lyte survey on the computer\nyou sound bitter captain\nfurther instructions\nchess\nexplain\nthat is true\nwhy thank you doctor ive just won my fourth game\nobserve for yourself rook to king spawn four\nnow this is the computers move and now mine checkmate mechanically the computers flawless therefore logically its report of the captains guilt is infallible i could not accept that however\nexactly i programmed it myself for chess some months ago the best i should have been able to attain was a draw\ntransporter room standby were beaming down\nfive in all\naffirmative\ni personally programmed the computer for chess months ago i gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own the computer can not make an error and assuming that i do not either the best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after stalemate and yet i beat the machine five times someone either accidentally or deliberately adjusted the programming and therefore the memory banks of that computer\naffirmative\nthe captain myself and the records officer\naffirmative until he was lost our records officer was lieutenant commander finney\naffirmative captain\nb deck in or near engineering\nacknowledged\ncompensate\ndecaying captain\ngentlemen if you ll please hurry to the transporter room\nvery well sir\nactivate port impulse engines one third power\nobviously\nmaintenance section eighteen the section is working on the intrepid reschedule the enterprise is on priority one that makes three times youve read it jim is there an error\nregulations captain and the extract from your ships computer log confirming this sworn deposition\nits a great pity the service cant afford to lose men like lieutenant commander finney\nill take that\nmister spock would you please\ncaptain kirk you say you jettisoned the pod after the red alert\nthen captain i must presume youve committed willful perjury this extract from your computer log says you jettisoned the pod before going to red alert consider yourself confined to the base official inquiry will determine whether a general court martial is in order captains log stardate 29485 starship enterprise remains in orbit around starbase eleven full repairs in progressive been ordered to standby on starbase eleven until the inquiry into the death of lieutenant commander finney can be conducted im confident of the outcome\nthis inquiry to determine whether a general court martial should be convened against captain kirk on charges of perjury and culpable negligence\nlet us begin with your relationship with commander finney you knew him for a long time didnt you\nits common knowledge that something happened to your friendship\ncontinue\nand he blamed you for that\ncomment service record of lieutenant commander finney to be appended this inquiry\nnow lets get into the specifics of the storm captain\nwhy finney\nif he blamed you\nthen why captain does the computer log from your ship made automatically at the time indicate that you were still on yellow alert when you jettisoned and not on red\nit would seem so could the computer be wrong\nstop recording now look jim not one man in a million could do what you and i have done command a starship a hundred decisions a day hundreds of lives staked on you making every one of them right your e played out jim exhausted\nthats the way my report ll read if you cooperate\npossibly\nadmit nothing say nothing let me bury the matter here and now no starship captain has ever stood trial before and i dont want you to be the first\nim thinking of the service i wont have it smeared\nall right by an evident perjure r whos either covering his bad judgment his cowardice or\nits in the transcript and computer transcripts dont lie im telling you captain either you accept a permanent ground assignment or the whole disciplinary weight of starfleet command is going to light right on your neck\nthen you draw a general court\nthis court is now in session i have appointed as members of this court space command representative lindstrom starship captains krasnov sky and chandra captain kirk i direct your attention to the fact that you have a right to ask for substitute officers if you feel that any of these

with real weapons or you might consider an alternative put an end to it makepeace\nall right its instinctive but the instinct can be fought were human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our hands but we can stop it we can admit that were killers but were not going to kill today thats all it takes knowing that we wont kill today contact vendi kari think you ll find that they re

about it isnt every first officer who gets to be l this captain several times\nbelieve me mister spock it was painful in more ways than one\nyou said they were benevolent and peaceful violent emotions overwhelm them destroy them i had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence thats the answer mister spock\ni had something else in mind can you put together a subsonic transmitter something we can hook into the communications station and broadcast over the communicator\ngood lets get to work\nwell if were both in the brig whos going to build the subsonic transmitter\nmister spock miss kalo mi is strictly your concern but should you talk to her while she s still under the influence of the spores\nthe captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the spore

choice elias he will stay\nthat can be explained\nlater\nand i never understood you until now there was always a place in here where no one could come there was only the face you allow people to see only one side you d allow them to know\ni missed you\nif i tell you how we survived will you try to understand how we feel about our life here about each other\nsomeone else might believe that your shipmates your captain but not me come\nits not much further\nits basic properties and elements are not important what is important is it gives life peace love\ncome i was one of the first to find

say i still love you you never told me if you had another name mister spock\npardon me captain biology report ready sir\ni heard sandoval saying they could grow anything here thats true sir they ve got a variety of crops in grains potatoes beans\nwell sir for an agricultural colony they have actually very little acreage planted theres enough to sustain the colony but very little more\non pure speculation just an educated guess id say that man is alive\nyou shook hands with him jim his flesh was warm hes alive theres no doubt about that\nthat ll be all thankyouverymuch\nive examined nine men so far varying in ages from twenty three to fifty nine theyre all in perfect condition textbook responses heart lungs excellent coordination excellent reflexes excellent if there are many more of them i could throw away my shingle\nno animals thats peculiar\nid like to see the medical records on the expedition\nim afraid ill have to bow out i have to continue with these medical examinations however if i find everyone else s health to be as perfect as yours i\nthis is mccoy jimi think you d better get back here\nno but id like you to see this for yourself\nsandoval s medical record four years ago when the expedition left earth he registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was a child no major operations but there was an appendectomy received all required inoculations etcetera\nnothing but i examined that man no more than two hours ago you know what his readings were perfect perfect and perfect just like everyone else ive examined here\nno i thought of that and tested it on myself it accurately recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs i had once it did not record the scar tissue on sandoval s lungs but it did record a healthy

going to examine some native plants he found did spock call in at all\nthat didnt sound at all like spock jim\ni didnt say that\nnot exactly he might be in trouble\nhow will you find spock\nwhat are you doing with those things de salle\nready to beam up hiya jimmy boy hey ive taken care of everything ally all gotta do is relax doctors orders\noh must be nigh onto a hundred by now\nim not interested in any physical psychological aspects jim boy we all perfectly healthy down here\nyeah thats right thats just what it is\nshonufheyjimboyy all ever have a real cold georgia style mint julep huh\nwho wants to counteract paradise jim boy\nmccoy out\nwell now its a little early to be counting stars miss leila\nwell now i think i can fix that for you enterprise\nwhat do you mean what sort of work im a doctor\noh no would you like to see how fast i can put you in a hospital\njust a minute you d better make me a mechanic then i can treat little tin gods like you sorry sandoval i dont know what made me do that\nyou cant stay here you cant survive without the spores after youve cleared at the starbase you could be relocated it depends upon what you want\nenterprise\nthis is mccoy sandoval would like to talk to the captain\nwell jim ive just examined the last of the colonists and they real lin absolutely perfect perfect health a fringe benefit leftover by the spores\nwell thats the second time mans been thrown out of paradise\napproaching omicron ceti three sir\nyes sir\nweve established orbits iran dive pinpointed a settlement\nabsolutely none captain berthold rays are such a recent discovery we do not yet have full knowledge of their nature it is known however that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposures and ovals group could not have survived after three years\ni am saying they knew there was a risk\nthe breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately we can risk a limited exposure\ncaptain this planet is being bombarded by berthold rays as our reports indicated at this intensity well be safe for a week if necessary but\ntheres also no question of the fact that berthold rays are incontrovertibly deadly theres no miracle connected with it doctor you know that no cures no serums no antidotes if a man is exposed long enough he dies\nspock here captain there seems to be a total absence of life on the planet with the exception of the colonists and various types of flora\nnot at the moment siri am conducting various tests with the tricorder but results are inconclusive\nnothing not even insects yet your plants grow and youve survived exposure to berthold rays\nplease do\ni have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct answer to any question\ni would like to know how your people have managed to survive here\nlogically you should all be dead\nemotions are alien to me im a scientist\nyouve not yet explained the nature of this thing\nwhat your e describing was once known in the vernacular as a happiness pill and you as a scientist should know that thats not possible\nspores\nno\nno i cant please dont\ni am not like you\niloveyou i can love you captains log supplemental we have been ordered by starfleet command to evacuate the colony on omicron three however the colony leader elias sandoval has refused all cooperation and will not listen to any arguments\nthat one looks like a dragon you see the tail and the dorsal spines\ni have on beren garia seven but ive never stopped to look at clouds before or rainbows you know i can tell you exactly why one appears in the sky but considering its beauty has always been out of the question\nyes what did you want\nyes captain what did you want\ni dont believe i want to tell you\nno i dont think so\ni dont think so sir\ni didnt want to jim\nthere ll be no evacuation jim but perhaps we should go back and get you straightened out\nvery well come with me\nmister sulu understands dont you mister sulu\ni can see the captain is going to be difficult\nalmost the entire ships complement has beamed down\nhe went off to create something called a mint julep thats a drink jim\nits impossible to say they drifted through space until they finally landed here you see they actually thrive on berthold rays the plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores until they find a human body to inhabit\nits a true eden jim theres belonging and love\nyou dont understand jim but youll come around sooner or later join us please\nyes jim what is it now\nwonderful jim when will you beam down\ngood leila and i will meet you at the beam down point\nspock here\nwhats keeping you jim we ve been waiting\ndo you want me to beam up a party\njust a moment it wont take long do you mind\nready to beam up jim\nthe term half breed is somewhat applicable but computerised is inaccurate a machine can be computerised not a man\njim i dont understand\ncaptain if you ll excuse me\nmy mother was a teacher my father an ambassador\ncaptain please dont\nthats enough\nyou did that to me deliberately\nthe spores theyre gone i dont belong anymore\nthat may be correct captain but trying to initiate a brawl with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical\nit can be done\ncaptain striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence\nthat is quite logical captain\nenterprise spock here\nyes yes im quite well\nare you still at the beam down point and is the doctor there\ngive your communicator back to doctor mccoy you wont need it to beam up itll take a few moments just wait there out\nill be back shortly captain\nit was

mister spock give us a report on life beneath the surface within range of our sensors there is no life other than the accountable human residents of this colony beneath the surface at least no life as we know it\nwe cant cover tunnel by tunnel on foot we must get production going again we must have that pergi um\ntoo many tunnels we couldnt possibly mister spock our sensors can pick up normal life functions at a considerable distance but what about abnormal life functions\nis there a replacement for that\nspock on board\nmister spock we seem to have been given a choice death by asphyxiation or death by radiation poisoning\ncan your i gone up its vital\nhow long\nforty eight hours is better than nothing gather what you need and beam down here with it bridge kirk\nhopefully well have found the missing part by then\nwell have to chief the alternative is to evacuate all you people up to the enterprise a dozen planets depend on you for pergi um for their reactor theyre already screaming reactors closing down life support systems\ndo you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the planet\nbut why now mister spock these production facilities have been in operation for over fifty years\nwhats that\nnot necessarily bones ive heard of the theoretical possibility of life based on silicon a silicon based life would be of an entirely different order its possible that our phasers might not affect it\nall right how about this a creature that lives deep in the planet below us at home in solid rock it seems to me that in order to survive it would have to have some form of natural armour plating\nbut our people have phaser number two\nyou may be right doctor but at least its something to go on mister spock have lieutenant commander giotto assemble the security troops and arm them with phaser number two you make the proper adjustments you seem fascinated by this rock\ndo they tie in\nspeculate\na short time mister spock we have very little\nhow sit going scotty\nit has to hold longer than a bit\nkirk here\nill be right there kirk out scotty ride herd on it kind words tender loving care kiss it baby it flatter it if you have to but keep it going\nyou will proceed from level to level checking out every foot every opening you are searching for some sort of creature which is highly resistant to phaser fire phasers will be set on maximum and remember this fifty people have died i want no more deaths\nthe creature mayor may not attack on sight however you must it is vitally important we get this installation back into production\nits one of the possibilities weve discussed i want your people to stay on the top level together at a safe place\nwell gentlemen you have your instructions lets get at it\nmister spock find something\ntraces\none of our people\ncome on\nits only been seconds since we heard him scream the creature must still be around\nthis tunnel my readings indicate it was made within the hour moments ago in fact\nare you certain\nthis tunnel goes back as far as the eye can see our best machinery couldnt cut a tunnel like this not even with phasers\ngone\nthese walls are hot\nyes perfectly\nyes we saw it where does the tunnel go\nyes we took a bite out of it\nits not animal tissue what is it\nthen your guess was right\nsummation\nthat would account for the tunnels\npowerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber\nits definitely phaser resistant we had our weapons set for silicon and on full power yet we only damaged it it still lives you mean its impossible to kill\nnono it might require amassed phasers\ncommander pass this onto your men we knew it was a killer now its wounded probably in pain somewhere back there theres nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal commander giotto instruct your men to concentrate the search in this sector remind them the creature is wounded\nwhat is it mister spock\none creature in a hundred miles\nthen were dealing with more than one creature despite your tricorder readings or we have a creature with an extremely long life span\nmister spock our mission is to protect this colony to get the pergi um moving again this is not a zoological expedition maintain a constant reading on the creature if we have to well use phasers to cut our own tunnels well try to surround it im sorry mister spock but im afraid the creature must die\ngood\nso it is wounded and therefore twice as dangerous stay in pairs if you see it concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to be its head concentrate it maintain it it is definitely resistant but it can be hurt and if it can be hurt it can be killed mister spock\nyour orders are shoot to kill protect yourself at all times commander giotto disperse your search parties\nmister spock captureit i dont recall giving any such order\ni will lose no more men the creature will be killed on sight and thats the end of it\nmister spock i want you to assist scotty in maintaining that makeshift circulating pump\nyou heard me its vital that we keep that reactor in operation your scientific knowledge\nmister spock you are second in command this will be a dangerous hunt either one of us by himself is expendable both of us are not\n22287to1 those are pretty good odds mister spock\nof course well i hate to use the word but logically with those kind of odds you might as well stay but please stay out of trouble mister spock\nkirk here\ncan you fix it again\nstart immediate evacuation of all colonists to the enterprise\nwe have nt enough phasers for you\ngood get everybody else aboard the enterprise the fewer people we have breathing the air down here the longer the rest of us will be able to hold out how much longer scotty\nwell do our best start feeding us constant status reports scotty van der berg you and your crew assemble at level twenty three checkpoint tiger kirk out\nteam up with the enterprise security personnel theyre better armed than you keep someone insight at all times van der berg take two men go through that tunnel there rendezvous with commander giotto appel and the rest of the men go through there and tie up with lieutenant osborne s detail mister spock and i will control the operation from a central point thats all\nmister spock\nare you sure intuition\nthe chart says both of these tunnels converge a few thousand yards further you take the left ill take the right\ntwo tunnels two of us we separate\nmister spock\nive found a whole layer of these silicon nodules of yours hundreds of them\nexplain\nyes mister spock im all right we seem to have had a cave in\nnon ono you d better not any disturbance might bring down the rest of the wall\nbesides it isnt necessary the chart said the tunnels meet further on\nvery well mister spock ill meet you at the other end\nkirk here\nits not necessary mister spock i know exactly where the creature is\nten feet away from me\nits not making any threatening moves spock\ni thought you were the one who wanted it kept alive captured if possible\nit seems to be waiting\nwell what do we do just talk it over\nwell you can be hurt cant you we just sit here its your move\nno no dont shoot come on over mister spock\nno it seems to be waiting i tried talking to it but it didnt do any good\nyes theyre all through here all over the place thousands of them\ndoes it means something to you\nyou think you can get through to that thing\nmister spock i know its a terrible personal lowering of mental barriers but if theres a chance\nno kill i what is that a plea for us not to kill it or a promise that it wont kill us\na horta a horta mister spock we need that retardation mechanism you must reestablish communications with it\nyes im aware of that if we could only win its confidence doctor mccoy this is captain kirk\ngrab your medical kit and come down here on the double ive got a patient for you\nnever mind just come down to the twenty third level youll be led to us by tricorder readings kirk out\nhesa healer let him heal mister spock you must reestablish communications i want to know why it suddenly took to murder\nweve seen how the creature destroys\nlieutenant commander giotto\nperfectly all right where are you\nunder no circumstances allow them in here yet the minute doc mccoy gets there send him through\nits wounded badly you ve got to help it\ngo take a look\nhelp it treat it\nyour e a healer theres a patient that san order mister spock tell it were trying to help the mechanism\nmister spock mister spock spock spock come out of iti found the unit in the reits in pretty good shape i also found about a million of these silicon nodules theyre eggs arent they\nthe miners must have broken into the hatchery their operations destroyed thousands of them no wonder\nhow are you doing doc\ndont fire first man that fires is dead\nyouve killed thousands of her children\nthose round silicon nodules that you ve been collecting and destroying theyre her eggs tell them mister spock\nthe horta is intelligent peaceful mild she had no objection to sharing this planet with you till you broke into her nursery and started destroying her eggs then she fought back in the only way she knew how as any mother would fight when her children are in danger\nthis is where they live they digest rock they tunnel for nourishment\nyes i know heres your circulating pump youve complained this planet is a mineralogical treasure house if you had the equipment to get at it gentlemen the horta moves through rock the way we move through air and it leaves tunnels the greatest natural miners in the universe it seems to me we could make an agreement reach a modus vivendi they tunnel you collect and process and your process operation would be a thousand times more profitable\ncan you help it\nhow\nwell spock im going to have to ask you to get in touch with the horta again tell her our proposition she and her children can do all the tunnelling they want our people will remove the minerals and each side will leave the other alone think shell go for it\nvery good mister spock\nfine yes chief kirk here\nim delighted to hear that chief once mother horta tells her kids what to look for you people are going to be embarrassingly rich\nour pleasure chief kirk out\nshe really liked those ears\nbecause she approved of you\ndoes not bear close examination

the usual sense anyway\nwell there are only fragments of bone and teeth left but the plants physician agrees with me a chemical corrosion almost as if he d been thrown into a vat of extremely corrosive acid\nstrong enough to eat anything else that you can think of\nyou recreating fantasies mister spock\nsilicon based life is physiologically impossible especially in an oxygen atmosphere\ni

beginning to think i can cure a rainy day\nhelp iti cured it\nwell i had the ship beam down a hundred pounds of that thermo concrete you know the kind we use to build emergency shelters out of its

those ears\ncan your i gone up its vital\nwhos there\ndidnt see a thing chief\nnobody ever does whatever the thing is its already killed fifty people in ever realised before how dark it is down here\nwhat goodwill that do you saw what happened to ed appel when he shot at it how about those other people before the monster got them\nokay chief ill do what i can\na lot can happen in three minutes chief is it true the enterprise is on its way\nyou think it could get here in the next four hours\na pergi um reactor no sir we dont have any spare circulating pump for a thing like that i havent seen apx kin twenty years\nwell siri can put together some odds and ends but it wont hold for long\nforty eight hours may be with a bit of luck\naye captain\nill be right down scott out\nwell sir its a plumbers nightmare but it ll hold for a bit\nsorry sir thats about the best i can do but i guarantee its not good enough\nill do what i can sir\nscotty here captain my brilliant improvisation just gave up the ghost it couldnt stand the strain\nnegative captain its gone for good\nthe reactor will go supercritical in about ten hours sir you have that long to find the mechanism\nim sure there is an answer it simply has not yet been discovered\nthere is no current volcanic activity on this planet captain\noh you mean shot at it\nfascinating\nmister van der berg what is this\nbut a geological oddity to say the least pure silicon\nive charted the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage here here and here if the times of these incidents are to be accepted as accurate the creature would have to have moved at an incredible rate of speed\nif we could force another appearance of this creature\ni wouldnt touch it captain an extremely active corrosive traces may linger\nthe same indication as shown at the door captain a very strong corrosive\nnothing for a device this antiquated captain\nthe missing pump wasnt taken by accident it was the one piece of equipment absolutely essential for the operation of the reactor\nit would seem so\ni dont know but there is a possibility\nlife as we know it is universally based on some combination of carbon compounds but what if life exists based on another element for instance silicon\ncertainly not phaser one which is far less powerful than phaser two\nit could explain much especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser one\nwhich i could adjust to be more effective against silicon\nit may be doctor that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment\nyes captain you recall that van der berg commented there were thousands of the seat a lower level the level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature\ni dont know\ni have already given doctor mccoy sufficient cause for amusement id prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time\ncaptain the security officers have gathered in chief van der bergs office\nmister van der berg may i ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon\nadjusting my tricorder to register for silicon captain interesting\na life form captain bearing one hundred eleven degrees elevation four degrees\nno sir silicon\nhe never even had a chance to fire captain\ncaptain what is it\nthis tunnel my readings indicate it was made within the hour moments ago in fact\npositive\nindeed captain im quite at a loss\ndisappeared astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly\nindeed this tunnel was cut within the last two minutes are you all right captain\nreadings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in that direction\nthe closest approximation i could come to would be fibrous asbestos a mineral captain\nit would seem so silicon based\nwe are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air\ncorrect this creatures body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive\nand it explains the murdered men\nor a single phaser with much longer contact\nive run a complete spherical check on all life forms radius one hundred miles ive located our men all of the man dive located one creature moving rapidly through native rock bearing two hundred and one and that is all\nexactly captain there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime\nor it is the last of a race of creatures which made these tunnels if so if it is the only survivor of a dead race to kill it would be a crime against science\ni see no alternative myself captain it merely seems a pity the search team is gathering in the main tunnel\ngentlemen if you ll examine your charts please i last located the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one this particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions in an effort to surround it and possibly capture it\nyou did not siri merely thought that if the opportunity arose\nvery well sir\nii beg your pardon sir\nis not needed there sir mister scott has far more knowledge of nuclear reactors than i do your e aware of that\ncaptain there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in this search against one creature the odds against you and i both being killed are 22287to1\nand they are of course accurate captain\nthat is always my intention captain\ncaptain we are being watched\nno sir were being watched\ncaptain fresh readings within the hour in each of these tunnels\nshould we separate\nyes captain\nindeed i find that most illuminating captain\nbe absolutely certain you do not damage any of them\nonly a theory i have\ncaptain are you all right jim jim\ni could phaser you out\nvery well but i find it extremely disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse please proceed with extreme caution is hall quicken my pace\ncaptain i just read some fresh signs\nthe creature is in this area ill take a life form reading\nwhere captain\nkill it captain quickly\nyou dont dare take the chance captain\nkill it\njim your life is in danger you cant take the risk\ni remind you its a proven killer im on my way spock out\nfascinating its made no moves against you\nyes i see\npossibly the answer captain but im not certain captain you are aware of the vulcan technique of the joining of two minds\nits possible\nill try\npain pain pain thats all i got captain waves and waves of searing pain its in agony\ni dont know captain evidently it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me in my brief contact with the creatures mind i discovered it is a highly intelligent extremely sophisticated animal in great pain of course because of its wound but not reacting at all like a wounded creature it calls itself a horta\ncaptain it has no reason to give us the device and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet\njimi remind you that this is a silicon based form of life doctor mccoys medical knowledge will be totally useless\nto obtain that kind of communication captain it will be necessary to touch it\nmurder of

they hatch she is the mother to them thousands of them this creature here is the mother of her race\nand they are the most inoffensive of creatures they harbour ill will towards no one\nexcept for one thing the horta is badly wounded it may die\nit seems logical captain the horta has a very logical mind and after close association with humans i find that curiously refreshing\nship ready to leave orbit captain course laid in\nchief engineer van der berg standing by on channel one\ncurious what chief van der berg said about the horta is exactly what the mother horta said to me she found humanoid appearance revolting but she thought she could get used to it\nnot specifically but i did get the distinct impressions he found them the most attractive human characteristic of all i didnt have the heart to tell her that only i have\ncaptain the horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature with impeccable taste\nreally captain my modesty\ncaptain i see no reason to stand

for it and our chemists were unable to analyse the corrosive agent\nyes it has i dont know what this butchering monster is but i know what its doing our maintenance engineers sent down to the drifts

it\nits a silicon nodule there are a millions of them are down there no commercial value\na few trace elements look we didnt call you here so you could collect rocks\nyoull have it just find that

stations look at that\nkirk quickly\nthe main circulating pump for the entire reactor is gone\nnon one its outdated but we never had any trouble with it\nwithout the pump mechanism the reactor will go

put a stop to this insane war\nit is being done\nunless both sides agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities all your armed forces wherever they may be will be immediately immobilised\nit is not rick commander we have simply put an end to your war all your military forces wherever they are are now completely paralysed\nno one has been killed captain\nto wage war captain to kill millions of innocent people to destroy life on a planetary scale is that what your e defending\noh eventually you will have peace but only after millions of people have died it is true that in the future you and the klingons will become fast friends you will work together\nyes please leave us the mere presence of beings like yourselves is intensely painful to us\nmillions of years ago captain we were humanoid like yourselves but we have developed beyond the need of physical bodies that of us which you see is mere appearance for your sake\nwe thank you for your altruistic offer captain but we really do not need your protection\nwe must be sure you are not harmed\na vulcan trader perhaps a dealer in kev as and trillium harmless to the klingons\nterrible to destroy\nbrave men\nit is necessary they may harm one another\nit will be hard\nwe have put a stop to your violence\nall instruments of violence on this planet now radiate a temperature of three hundred and fifty degrees they are inoperative\nwe

if they should emerge\nyou will evaluate the situation if there is a fleet of them youll get out of here mister sulu\nno but s youll get to safety and alert the fleet you will not attack alone mister

captain james t kirk of the starship enterprise representing the united federation of planets this is my first officer mister spock\ni would like to speak to someone in authority\nyou people are in great danger is there someplace we can go and talk\ngentlemen my government has informed me that the klingons are expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it a base of operation against the federation my mission frankly is to keep them from doing it\nno sir with the federation you have a choice you have none with the klingons the klingons area military dictatorship war is their way of life life under the klingon rule would be very unpleasant we offer you protection\nyou have this planet and its strategic location i assure you that if you dont take action to prevent it the klingons will move against you as surely as your sunrises we will help you build defences build facilities\ngentlemen i have seen what the klingons do to planets like yours they are organised into vast slave labour camps no freedoms whatsoever your goods will be confiscated hostages taken and killed your leaders confined youd be far better off on a penal planet infinitely better off\nyou keep insisting theres no danger i keep assuring you there is would you mind telling me\nthats the first thing that would be lost excuse me gentlemen im a soldier not a diplomatic an only tell you the truth\ncertainly\nthat doesnt seem likely\nthank you mister spock that might be useful\ngentlemen i must get you to reconsider we can be of immense help to you in addition to military aid we can send you specialists technicians we can show you how to feed a thousand people where one was fed before we can help you build schools educate the young in the latest technological and scientific skills your public facilities are almost nonexistent we can help you remake your world end disease hunger hardship all we ask in return is that you let us help you now\nexcuse me sir kirk here\npositive identification\nmister sulu follow your orders get out of here contact the fleet return if the odds are more equal kirk out gentlemen you kept insisting that there was no danger\ncan you verify that\nif you had listened to me\nhow does he know that\nso were stranded here in the middle of a klingon occupation army\nyou have a gift for understatement mister spock its not a very pleasant prospect at all captains log stardate 32017misterspockandi are trapped on the planet organi a which is in the process of being occupied by the forces of the klingon empire the organ ians have provided us with native clothing in the hopes we may be taken for organ ians\ndid you take them\ni must ask you to return them\nthey know that vulcan is a member of the federation\nwhat about the rest of you\nyou have a lot to learn sir and if i know the klingons youll be learning it the hard way\ni have a tongue\nmy what\nhes no spy\nhes done nothing nothing at all\nyour e here theres nothing i can do about it\nyou need my approval\nyou seem to be in command\nme i dont want the job\nand mister spock\nhe is my friend\ni dont understand\nand your e proud of it\nare you sure your e all right\nori will be killed\nthat mind sifter cant be all the terror they think it is\nill try and avoid it 2\nyou didnt really think i was going to be at his head in did you\nyour e right but as you say we still have a job to do\nmaybe but sooner or later theyll start resenting how the klingons run things if we could prove to them they could do something to strike back to keep the klingons off balance\nthats exactly what i had in mind mister spock did i or did i not see something that looked like a munitions dump outside of kors headquarters\ni think its time we did a little simple and plain communicating tonight\nwere short of tools\nokay so far sonic grenade\nyou were right mister spock a most satisfactory display\nof course we blew it up deliberately\nwe did it to show you that you can fight back you dont have to be sheep you can be wolves\nhistory is full of examples of civil populations fighting back successfully against a military dictatorship we may not be able to destroy the klingons but we can tie them up blow up their installations disrupt their communications make organi a useless to them\nwhy are you afraid of retribution does your personal freedom mean so little to you\nall i understand is that you apparently dont have the backbone to fight and protect your loved ones\ni speak of courage gentlemen does courage mean so little to you\naye l borne\nim used to the idea of dying but i have no desire to die for the likes of you\nno thank you\nwhat do you want from me\nyou think im going to sit here and just talk with the enemy\nsomething was destroyed nothing inconsequential i hope\nwere nothing like you were a democratic body\nits a very large universe commander full of people who dont like the klingons\ngo climb a tree\nit will take a lot longer than that commander\nhow much of the twelve hours do we have left\ni think we can count on them being punctual blowing that munitions dump wasnt enough if we get out of here we ve got to carry the attack directly to kor these organ ians\nnevertheless our orders still stand we ve got to make some attempt to neutralise the klingon occupation\nand there are guards every few feet down the hall\ngo\nyou turned us over to them you expect us to trust you now\nwe cant stay here this is the first place theyll look\nfirst you turn us in then get us out what are you doing now waiting for the klingons to post a reward so you can turn us in again and collect it\nwhat happened to them\nis thats all you can do smile\ni want to know how im free and why\nthis idiotic placidity of yours your refusal to do anything to protect yourselves\nthose are klingon phasers take the door get down gentlemen\ndid you hear them\nwell mister spock it seems its up to you and me\nthe federation has invested a great deal of money in our training theyre about due for a small return we have two hours with which to do it in\nno no more will die on account of us mister spock where are those phasers\nyouve told us a great deal about how you hate violence unless you tell me where those phasers are your e going to have more violence than you know what to do with\nits entirely up to you\ngentlemen i have no great love for you your planet your culture despite that mister spock andi are going to go out there and quite probably die in an attempt to show you that there are some things worth dying for\ncome on mister spock lets get out of here\nmister spock can we get those two guards what would you say the odds on our getting out of here\ndifficult to be precise 7824to1\nthats a pretty close approximation\nyou do quite well set your phaser on stun were after the top dog not the members of the pack\nbut if the situation calls for it we kill is that clear\nill take the one on the left fire\nif you dont tell me what i want to know ill kill you here and now is that clear\nis kors office down there\nwhat about the hostages talktalk\nto be killed\nmister spock\nwell what are the odds now\nless than seven thousand to one well getting better getting better\njust stay where you are commander\ncheckmate commander\ni dont intend to kill you unless i have to\ncover spock back\nwhat is it spock\nyou are stopping this you\nkirk to enterprise come in\nstandby sulu\nwhat have you done\nyour e talking nonsense\nyou cant just stop the fleet what gives you the right\nwe have legitimate grievances against the klingons theyve invaded our territory killed our citizens theyre openly aggressive theyve boasted that they ll take over half the galaxy\nyour e the ones who issued the ultimatum to withdraw from the disputed areas\nyou should be the first to be on our side two hundred hostages killed\neven if you have some power that we dont understand you have no right to dictate to our federation\nhow to handle their interstellar relations we have the right\nwell no one wants war but there are proper channels people have a right to handle their own affairs eventually we will have\nwhat do you mean beings like yourselves\nbut what about this planet the fields the buildings this citadel\nwell commander i guess that takes care of the war obviously the organ iansa rent going to let us fight\nim embarrassed i was furious with the organ ians for stopping a war i didnt want we think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe its

talk\nyoull talk either here now voluntarily or under our mind scanner the fact is captain i have a great admiration for your starfleet a remarkable instrument and i must confess to a certain admiration for you iknow of course that it was you who destroyed our supplies last night\nhardly they were quite important to us but they can be replaced you of the federation you are much like us\ncome now im not referring to minor ideological differences i mean that we are similar as a species here we are on a planet of sheep two tigers predators hunters killers and it is precisely that which makes us great and there is a universe to be taken\nexcellent then it shall be a matter of testing each others wills of power survival must be earned captain tell me about the dispersal of your

this culture\nit would seem so\ncaptain if you dont mind i should like to wander about the village and make some studies\ncaptain our information on these people and their culture was not correct this is not a primitive society making progress toward mechanisation they are totally stagnant there is no evidence of any progress as far back as my tricorder can register\nnevertheless it is true for tens of thousands of years there has been absolutely no advancement no significant change in their physical environment this is a laboratory specimen of an arrested culture\nnegative captain but it

strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the immediate problem accomplishing our mission here\ni thought you might\nwell receive no help from the organ ians\nverbal persuasion seems to be

that would explain a lot another universe perhaps in another dimension occupying the same space at the same time\nall right what would happen if another universe say a minus universe came into contact with a positive universe such as ours\nwhich is what we ve been experiencing the point where they come into contact couldnt that be described as a hole\nor what is outside to enter the invasion that

other out violently\nlike lazarus identical like both lazarus only one is matter and the other antimatter if they meet\nof everything that exists everywhere\nall available personnel on the double spock with me\nreport\nhes probably beaming down with the crystals right now im going after him you organise a security detail follow me as soon as you can\nenergise\nlazarus\nno him\nnot completely this is a parallel universe\nantimatter\nand if identical particles meet\nhe has two more\nexactly what did i pass through\nthis corridor is it what caused the magnetic effect the winking out phenomenon\nand the universe is safe\nsurely lazarus must realise what would happen if you should meet face to face outside the corridor\nso your e the terrible thing the murdering monster the creature\ni understand what do you want me to do\nyou cant hold him forever\nif i destroy his ship wont yours also be destroyed\nand your door will be closed\nyoull be trapped inside that corridor with him forever at each others throats throughout time\nim ready\nstand back\ni must destroy that ship completely\nand what of lazarus\nactivate phaser banks\nstandby to fire\nfire phasers\nall right mister lesley lets get out of here ahead warp factor one\neverythings all right mister spock for us\nthere is of course no escape how would it be trapped forever with a raging madman at your throat

its not too late we can still stop him but i but i need need your help\nthat show i came to be down there captain pursuing the devils own spawn a thin give chased across the universe hes humanoid outside but inside hesa hideous murdering monster ill get him captain i swear it\nnot man thing\nto the last man woman and child\ni was inspecting magnetic communications satellites you believe me dont you\nthat was hehe s death anti life he lives to destroy\nyes i give you my word is wear it\nthen youll join me in my holy cause help me in visiting justice and vengeance upon him\ncaptain you yourself said there were no other explanations why do you give credence to this man\nno youve come back in is it well dont stop here iam come at me again well finish it\ncome come itll do you no good ill chase you to the very fires of hell\ni saw it again the thing it attacked me\ni told you it was a thing all white black and empty a terrible emptiness\nhell kill us all if we dont kill him first kill kill kill kill kill captains log stardate 30883 we continue to orbit the dead planet which seems to be the source of the phenomenon which has struck the enterprise and all sections of the galaxy once again as for lazarus the story he tells me about the humanoid continues to trouble me\nyes but impatient have you decided to help me yet\nis something wrong\nyes thats it the dilithium crystals with their power we could do it\nyes we ve got him captain we ve got him\nthats just it thats the key thats the way to trap him thats the solution captain i beg of you ip lead i demand give me the crystals\nyou fool there wont be any ship if we dont kill him hell destroy all of you\ni warn you captain youll give me the crystals\nno threat intended captain ill have my vengeance\nand fact captain i didnt take the crystals im not the one find my enemy find the beast and you ll find the crystals\nhe did isnt that enough\ni tell you were dealing with a creature capable of destroying worlds\nfor the same reason that i do listen to me hes humanoid why he he can pilot a spaceship he can compute formulas to destroy race she can steal an energy source for his vehicle so he can escape from me are you deaf as well as blind\nthank you captain\nwhat do you believe now captain\ncaptain lookout\nthe thing the thing\nthe rock i\naches\nwhy should nti\ngo ahead its all right\nyou wouldnt believe me if i told you\nall right i distorted a fact in the interest of self preservation for my holy cause i needed help not censure freedom not captivity for being a madman i was afraid thats what you d call me if i told you the truth\nmy planet my earth or whats left of it is down there beneath us\nmyspace ship is more than just that its a time chamber a time ship and ii am a time traveller\noh yes he sf led me across all the years all the empty years to a dead future on a murdered plane the destroyed help me give me the tools i need to kill him the crystals dont let him get away dont let him get away\ni told you hes got them he took them the thing the thing\noh i didnt know\nill get you now i have a threshold run run ill get you now\nits done its done finished finished its done its done its done its done\ndone no dont not you\nno\nwelcome captain i wasnt expecting you\nyes him you understand\nof course\nher eyes\nthe end of everything civilisation existence all gone i tried to stop him captain thats why i took your dilithium crystals\nthats very bad captain if he comes through at a time of his own choosing but i think if we hurry and you will help me he can yet still be stopped theres little time left he meant to come through when you accidentally passed through it drained his crystal sitll take him about ten minute store energise with the equipment aboard his ship that should give us enough time\nthats hard to explain captain i call it an alternative warp its sort of a negative magnetic corridor where the two parallel universes meet its sort of a safety valve it keeps eternity from blowing up\nprecisely captain but not because of its existence because because my foe entered the corridor is like a prison with explosives at the door open the door and the explosives might go off stay inside\nboth universes captain yours and mine\nof course he knows captain but he smad you heard him he s lost his mind when our people found a way to slip through the warp and prove another universe an identical one existed it was too much for him he could not live knowing that i lived he became obsessed with the idea of destroying me the fact that it meant his own destruction and everything else meant nothing to him\nyes captain or he is it depends on your point of view doesnt it its ready captain if we can force him into the corridor while im waiting for him we can put an end to this but if he comes through at a time of his own choosing and breaks into this universe to find me\nfind him force him through his threshold while im waiting for him into the corridor and ill hold him there\ncanti captain you destroy his ship\nit will\nyes and so will his\nis it such a large price to pay for the safety of two universes\nsend him to me ill be waiting\nno no

constitution of a dinosaur recuperative powers ditto as we both know im a bright young medic with a miraculous touch why then when i returned there was nt a trace of that wound on his forehead not

this solar system simply blinked the planet below the mass of which were measuring attained zero gravity\nis nonexistence\ncaptain scanners now report a life object on the planet surface

a closer examination of the planets surface would be in order my job sir\nnegative captain anything from our guest\nlieutenant uhura communicated that information i ordered reconfirmation on our sensors they indicate no living creature on this planet i suggest captain that you ve been lied to\ni fail to comprehend your indignation sir ive simply made the logical deduction that you are a liar\nim trying captain\ncaptain readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this planet almost on this very spot\nnegative captain i can no more explain the occurrence of the second phenomenon than ican the first\nthat a single creature a humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude\nindeed\naffirmative\ncaptain i only know for certain that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that lazarus has his alleged confrontations\nrequest you come to the bridge captain\nsomething quite extraordinary\nmain screen on lieutenant\nsource of radiation captain\nbecause it is not there\nwhat i mean captain is that according to our usual scanning procedures there is nothing there that could be causing that effect\naffirmative i confess i am somewhat at a loss for words it may be described though loosely and in accurately as a rip in our universe\na kind of physical warp captain in which none of our established physical laws apply with any regularity however with the dilithium crystals i was able to localise it\nyou refer to the humanoid\nwhy does he need the crystals for what reason\nunable to locate the source of radiation\nit has simply disappeared captain\ntrue captain but more significant to me is the fact that our ships instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any object in our universe be it energy or matter\ncorrect which would seem to be impossible\nperfect working condition\nnor in our universe captain it came from outside\nthe possible existence of a parallel universe has been scientifically conceded captain\nunquestionably a warp a distortion of physical lawson an immense scale\nindeed i point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple container can either allow the contents to escape\nthere has been no evidence of a large scale invasion\ndifficult captain one moment paranoid the next calm mild rational almost as if he were two men\nthrough which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass\nthe cut on his forehead first he has it then its gone then he has it again\nquite right unquestionably there are two of him\njim madness has no purpose or reason but it may have a

miracle\naye\ngood luck gentlemen\nwhat happened sir you only left a moment ago\ni believe well have them plotted in a few more orbits captain\nthis is of great scientific importance captain were actually passing through ripples in time\nall plotted but one captain coming up on it now seems to be fairly heavy displacement\nthe hypo captain\nempty\nconfirmed by the library record tapes captain subjects failed to recognise acquaintances became hysterically convinced that they were in mortal danger and were seeking escape at any cost extremely dangerous to himself or to anyone else who might\nand the transporter at that time captain was focused on the centre of the time disturbance\nand of considerable age on the order of ten thousand centuries old\nunbelievable captain\nthis single object is the source of all the time displacement\ni cant for this to do what it does is impossible by any science i understand it is operating even now putting out waves and waves of time displacement which we picked up millions of miles away\nincredible power it cant be a machine as we understand mechanics\ni see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles\na time portal captain a gateway to other times and dimensions if im correct\nreally\nrelive the accident this time be certain that the hypo accident is avoided look at the speed with which the centuries are passing captain to step through on precisely the day we wish\ni am a fool my tricorder is capable of recording even at this speed ive missed taping centuries of living history which no man before has ever\nwith no past no future\ni was recording images at the time mccoy left a rather barbaric period in your american history i believe i can approximate just when to jump perhaps within a month of the correct time a week if were fortunate\nthere is no alternative\nseconds now sir standby\nand now\nit was called depression circa1930 quite barbaric\nim afraid im going to be difficult to explain in any case captain\nthat should prove interesting\nfascinating\ntheft captain\nyou were saying you ll have no trouble explaining it\nperhaps the unfortunate accident i had as a child\noh yes its quite untidy here let me help you\ncaptain i hardly believe that insults are within your prerogative as my commanding officer\nfirst i believe we have about a week before mccoy arrives but we cant be certain\nthere is a theory there could be some logic to the belief that time is fluid like a river with currents eddies backwash\nunless that is true captain we have no hope frustrating locked in here is the place and moment of his arrival even the images of what he did if only i could tie this tricorder in with the ships computers for just a few moments\nin this zinc plated vacuum tubed culture\nat what rate of payment i need radio tubes and so forth my hobby\nyes of course captain\nspeculation gifted insight\nwe have a what captain\none might have said so in the first place\ncaptain i must have some platinum a small block would be sufficient five or six pounds bypassing certain circuits through there to be used as a duo dyne tic field core\ncaptain your e asking me to work with equipment which hardly very far ahead of stone knives and bear skins\ncaptain captain in three weeks at this rate possibly a month i might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits\ni am endeavouring maam to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bear skins\ncaptain tools for finely detailed work\ni needed the fine tools for my radio work they d have been returned in the morning\ninteresting where would you estimate we belong miss keeler\nill finish with the furnace\ni may have found our focal point in time\nyes im overloading those lines i believe well have our answer on this screen captain\nand captain you may find this a bit distressing\nive slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex\nbad enough\nit would seem unlikely jim a few moments agoireada1930 newspaper article\nor captain edith keeler will die this year i saw her obituary some sort of traffic accident\ncaptain edith keeler is the focal point in time we ve been looking for the point that both we and doctor mccoy have been drawn to\nis the random element\nor perhaps he prevents her from being killed we dont know which\ncaptain suppose we discover that in order to set things straight again edith keeler must die\nill need at least two more days before id are make another attempt\ncaptain our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of thirty hours work infused and burned circuits\nthis is how history went after mccoy changed it here in the late 1930sa growing pacifist movement whose influence delayed the united states entry into the second world war while peace negotiations dragged on germany had time to complete its heavy water experiments\nbecause all this lets them develop the a bomb first theres no mistake captain let me run it again edith keeler founder of the peace movement\nshe was right but at the wrong time with the a bomb and with their v2 rockets to carry them germany captured the world\nand all this because mccoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in a street accident as she was meant to we must stop him jim\nwe can estimate general happenings from these images but i cant trace down precise actions at exact moments captain im sorry\njim edith keeler must die\ncaptain i did not plan to eavesdrop\ni must point out that when she stumbled she might have died right there had you not caught her\nwere not that sure of our facts whos to say when the exact time will come save her do as your heart tells you to do and millions will die who did not die before\nwhat is it\nno jim\nhe knows doctor he knows\nwe were successful\nwere holding orbit sir the helm is sluggish\nrecording sir\nlanding party to enterprise no sign of doctor mccoy search progressing\ncaptain ive lost contact with the ship i was talking to

readings have never looked like that before not even on mister spock\ndoctor thats not all your e going to do\ndoctor there is more of it in him entwined all through his body\nmister spock\nmister spock\nbridge this is sickbay tell doctor mccoy mister spock just left here\nhes delirious and possibly dangerous\nready doctor\ndoctor the results of the first tests on the creatures remains\nanything lieutenant\ntry gsk783subspacefrequency3\nim very well aware of that lieutenant try it\nevaluation mister spock\nand next inlined eneva bones whats your theory about the cause of all this\nbut it follows a definite pattern a systematic progression from planet to planet\nplot an interception course mister sulu warp factor eight lieutenant uhura try to contact that ship\nscotty tractor beams\nden evans hip this is the enterprise can you reverse your course acknowledge\nkeep closing den evans hip reverse your course do you hear me reverse your course acknowledge\nreverse course one hundred and eighty degrees about\nvery well reduce to sub warp speed take us to den eva\nthat den evans hip headed deliberately into the sun why\nkeep trying\nput it on audio\naurel an this is jim on the enterprise repeat your message\nreestablish\nim not interested in your excuses lieutenant reestablish contact with that transmitter\nkeep trying to raise them\nyes you were right a while back my brothers am lives on de neva hesa research biologist that woman sounded like his wife aurel an\nset your phasers on stun were going to be am directly into the capital city alert status mister spock\nill want a complete transcript of everything that happens down there yeoman\nlets go energise\nthere are almost a million inhabitants of den eva theres more than one hundred thousand in this city alone where is everyone\nmy brothers lab is over there they signalled us once there should be someone there lets find out whats happening\nstandby to fire fire\ndid you hear what they said mister spock\nthey tried to brain us with these clubs check them out bones\nto say the least\nfanout follow me security\naurel an\nbones aurel an your e safe now\nsam it is my brother was my brother\npeter\nget ready to beam up\nyes yes mister spock you heard my sister in law say something about they being here your guess\nit doesnt make sense there are no harmful life forms reported our sensors didnt pick up anything that didnt belong here\ntake charge of the landing party mister spock i want some answers to all this\ncan she talk\naurel an aurel an its jim\nhes dead but your sons still alive you ve got to help us\nyes im here you have to tell us what happened aurel an to you and the others\nwho\nwhat kind of things\naurel an its important that you tell us what kind of things\nreport\nyouve seen some kind of creature any alien form\nall right lets go find out what it is set your phasers on force three to kill were looking for some kind of creature and we already know it will kill\nspock\nform a ring fire\nand it can bear up underfull phaser power\nits too close in here it may be a trap in here lets move out\nspock spock its gone can you stand spock are you all right captains log supplemental whatever the creatures are they have apparently taken over all the inhabitants of den eva meanwhile ships surgeon doctor mccoy is examining a strange puncture wound left by one of the creatures on mister spock s back\nhow is he\ndid you operate on spock in time\nmy nephew\nrecommendations\nall decks security alert locate and restrain mister spock he may be dangerous use phasers on stun if necessary\nget him back to the sickbay use security restraints\nspock\nyour e only half vulcan what about the human half of you\ncan he control it the way he says bones\ni need you spock but we cant take any chances well keep you confined for a while longer if you can maintain control well see my nephew if here gains consciousness will he go through that\nhelp them i dont care what it takes or costs you ve got to help them\nmister spock i gave you an order to stay in the sickbay\nscotty\nmister spock your logic as usual is inescapable beam him down stay in constant touch with us give him your phaser hell need that too\nenergise\ni dont have to bones we both know he is\nyes that would answer a lot of questions\ni think so this may be one cell in a larger organism an incredibly huge organism in fact\nexisting so differently from any living matter or energy as we know it that it may have come here planet by planet from an entirely different galaxy\nbut not impossible mister spock the den evan that flew into the sun cried out that he was free that he dw on thats the angle to work on gentlemen i want an analysis of all this from medical and life science departments within the hour\nthen your e wasting your time there has to be something that ll kill the creature without destroying the human host\ni cant accept that bones we ve got fourteen science labs aboard this ship the finest equipment and computers in the galaxy\nno no bones theres more than two lives at stake here i can not let it spread beyond this colony even if it means destroying a million people down there captains log stardate 32898iam faced with the most difficult decision of my life unless we find a way to destroy the creatures without killing their human hosts my command responsibilities will force me to kill over a million people\ngentlemen\ni will accept neither of those alternatives gentlemen i can not let this thing expand beyond this planet nor do i intend to kill a million or more people to stop it i want another answer im putting you gentlemen on the hotseat with me i want that third alternative\nreport\nrequest denied\nrequest denied there must be another answer something in the sun killed that thing before the den evan died all right all right weve tried heat radiation what other qualities or properties does the sun have\nbut one other thing you havent mentioned its bright it radiates a blinding light if youre close enough\nnot to us but down on the surface the creatures stayed in the shadows for the most part suppose they were nt simply hiding suppose they re sensitive to light light like in a sun close up\nno but you can move the equivalent of the sun to den eva mister spock\ngood lets get on it\nyour figures are of course accurate\nit worked in a lab with the creature exposed to everything we can give it but what about the people who are infected\nmay be theres no time for may be s bones we need to know now\nyes wed have to put someone who s infected under that light\nwe have to duplicate the conditions on the planet and spock\ntheres no other way bones we have to duplicate the brilliance that existed at the moment the den evan declared himself freed\ni agree completely\nproceed\nspock are you all right\nwhat is it\nare you telling me that spock need not have been blinded\nbones take care of him\ngood scanners\nsatellite control this is the captain energise all satellites\nreport\nsickbay\ntell spock it worked\nbones it wasnt your fault\nbones\nbones\nyeoman record this for starfleet command\nthe alien creatures on de neva have been destroyed\nspock you can see\nmister spock regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience for most you ip resume felt nothing\nif you gentlemen are finished would you mind laying in a course for starbase ten mister spock\nwhats that doctor\nyou ve been so concerned about his vulcan eyes doctor you forgot about his vulcan ears ahead warp factor one mister sulu\naffirmative\ntheres no medical or scientific cause for what happened on those planets jim\ntheres one possibility the mass insanity may have reached this planet too\njim your brothers am and his family arent they stationed on this planet captains log stardate 32872 the mass insanity we have tracked across this section of the galaxy seems to have already touched de neva that planet colonised over a century ago is one of the most beautiful in the galaxy\njim did you know who that woman was\ntheres something wrong jim their nervous systems unconscious like this there should be just routine autonomic activity but im getting a very high reading as though even in their unconscious state theyre being violently stimulated\nis this your brother jim\nim sorry jim the boys unconscious but he s still alive\nid better get the boy and his mother back to the ship i cant do much for them down here\nmccoy to enterprise prepare to beam up party of four\nready to beam up captain id like you to be on board when your sister in law regains consciousness\ni wont be able to give you the exact cause until i get the plates back from the lab theyre both in extreme pain i sedated them heavily but your sister in law seems to have a high tolerance the tranquilli ser hasnt affected her much\nyes\nwhen she answers questions any questions its as if she s fighting to get the answers out as though something is exerting pain to stop her\nnurse thats the second time he s come out of it either hes fighting us or something inside of him is fighting us\nlets prepare to close nurse\nmiss chapel\nmiss chapel if you can not assist me as required call another nurse in here but do one or the other now\nto be very frank jim i dont know that i can do anything for spock or your nephew theyre pieces of some form of living tissue i removed one from spock s spinal cord the other from your sister in laws body theyre both the same the boys too weak to touch besides removal of the tissue wouldnt stop the pain anyhow as far as i can tell\nnoi just removed these for examination his body s full of these tentacles entwining and growing all about his nervous system\nthe same evidently when the creature attacks it leaves a stinger much like a bee or wasp leaving one of these in the victims body it takes over the victim very rapidly and the entwining is far far too involved for conventional surgery to remove\nim sorry jim the lab the science departments were all stumped\nthe k3 indicator registers the level of pain watch as i turn it on thats what he s been going through ive never seen anything like it no wonder the poor devils go mad\nwho knows jimi know the amount of pain the creature can inflict upon him but whether he can control it hour to hour\nyes\njim arent you for getting something there are over a million colonists on that planet down there just as much your responsibility they need your help too\njim this is ridiculous i dont want my patients running around he should be in bed\njim that man is sick dont give me any damnable logic about him being the only man for the job\nyou may be controlling the pain mister spock but your e far from all right\nim sorry captain ive tried everything i can variant radiation intense heat even as great as nine thousand degrees\nwhich happens to be my point the thing wont die even at temperatures and radiation which would burn spock and your nephew to ashes\ncaptain i understand your concern your affection for spock the fact that your nephew is the last survivor of your brothers family\ngentlemen i want it stopped too but not at the cost of destroying over a million people\nif killing five people saves ten its a bargain is that your simple logic mister spock\nim sorry jim we ve been over and over it made every conceivable test\njim we ve been through it and through it radiation heat\nnothing lethal about light\nyou cant moved eneva closer to the sun jim\nwell i can riga test cubicle in the biolab put our specimen in it but i dont\nput on your masks\ncompleted\nit worked we can do it whats the matter jim we can do it\nwell i dont know may be trial\nbut id have to put a\ndo you have any idea of the risk\ndo you know what one million candlelight per square inch can do to your optic nerve s\nall right ill rig up a protective pair of goggles\nunfortunately your e both right its the only thing we can do all right mister spock\nmister spock s the best first officer in the fleet\ncompleted\noh no\ni threw the total spectrum of light at the creature it wasnt necessary i didnt stop to think that only one kind of light might ve killed it\ni didnt need to throw the blinding white light at all jim spock i\nmccoy here\nyes captain hell be happy to hear that\nthe blindness was temporary jim theres something about his optical nerves which are nt the same as a humans\nt is a pity your brief blindness did not increase your appreciation for beauty mister spock\nunusual eye arrangement i might ve known hed turn up with something like that\ni said please dont tell spock i said he was the best first officer in the fleet\ngo back getaway we dont want to hurt you go back get out of here go on getaway go away get out of here we dont want to hurt you\ni did it its finally gone im free im\nout of range sir\ncaptain well get too close to the sun\naye they make regular trips from here carrying supplies to the asteroid belt for the miners and bringing cargo out ive made the run a couple of times myself as an engineering advisor\nnone sir just that noise we heard\nmister spock i thought you were still confined to sickbay\nhere now where do you think your e going\nnot likely mister spock\naye sir and im sorry i have to disobey it the captain said no one was to transport down mister spock\nfreeze right there mister spock or ill put you to sleep for sure this is mister scott in the transporter room get me the captain\nhe said he was transporting down to the surface sir your orders were that no one was to be am down unless you authorised it and knowing mister spock s determination on some things i thought id better hold him here until i got your orders\nscanners ready sir kirk very well ready helm\nall satellites operative captain\nas i speculated captain the overall pattern of mass insanity destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this section of the galaxy over here the beta port il in system the ancient civilisations archaeologists have given us information indicating that they were the beginning two hundred years ago levin i us five was swept by mass insanity then theta cygni twelve the last was ingraham b two years ago\nthe ship is a one man vessel of den evan configuration captain he does not seem to be out of control his course is straight for the sun\nouter hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and rising\nso are we hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising the suns gravimetric pull increasing\nall clear captain hull temperature falling gravimetric pull approaching tolerance level\nplanet development is normal captain originally colonised as a freighting line base in this area\nno federation contacts for over a year\nlieutenant uhura has had no further response to our signals sensors report the expected number of humans on the planet surface however they are strangely quiet very little activity\ntheyre here captain in the buildings strangely quiescent\ncaptain several people approaching\nindeed they seemed most concerned for our safety\ntheir attitude was inconsistent with their actions\ncaptain i understand how you must\nnotice the ventilator captain apparently they were trying to keep something outside from getting in obviously they were not entirely successful\nthat is correct i am at a loss to understand it\nthe streets are extraordinarily quiet captain weve seen no other den evans and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came out\na peculiar buzzing sound we were about to investigate it\nincredible not only should it have been destroyed by our phasers it does not even register on my tricorder\nit is not life as we know or understand it yet t is obviously alive it exists\ncaptain i suggest we risk taking it aboard\nno no\nno i wont\ni must take the ship\ndown i must take it down\ndoctor mccoy captain\nthese restraints will no longer be necessary nor will your sedatives doctor ill be able to return to duty i apologise for my weakness earlier when i tried to take control of the ship i simply did not understand what is there to understand mister spock\ni am a vulcan doctor pain is a thing of the mind the mind can be controlled\nit is proving to be an inconvenience but it is manageable and the creature with all of its thousands of parts even now is pressuring me it wants this ship but i am resisting\ni have my own will captain let me help\ni am a vulcan i am a vulcan there is no pain\ni was\ni have an errand on the planets surface you will be am me down to the same coordinates as before\nthat is an order mister scott\nuntil the pain was gone captain it has been discontinued by me\none of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed captain we did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when i was attacked since my nervous system is already affected as you pointed out doctor i dont believe they can do much more to me\ni am in complete control of myself doctor the fact that i am here proves that i do not belong in bed\nthank you captain\ncome in gentlemen i believe you ll find this interesting doctor your medical skill and curiosity are quite admirable but i assure you im all right\nunimportant at the moment doctor please observe interesting gentlemen a one celled creature resembling more than anything else a huge individual brain cell\ndo you understand what im suggesting captain\nand although it is not physically connected to the other cells it is nevertheless part of the whole creature guided by the whole drawing its strength from the whole which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons\nfrom a place where our physical laws do not apply we may therefore find it difficult to destroy captain\nyes sir\ni regret i see no other choice for you captain we already know this thing has destroyed three civilisations perhaps more\nincluding myself doctor and captain kirks young nephew understandably upsetting but once it spread spas there there are dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people\ni therefore request permission to be am down to the planets surface i also suggest that your nephew accompany me\ncaptain i do not make this request lightly i do not know how much longer i can hold out against the pain but i do know what the boy will go through should here gain consciousness\nit exists physically it occupies space it has mass therefore gravity it converts matter to energy\na possibility\nyes in essence it can be done a string of satellites around the planet with burning tri magnesite and trevi um\nof course the light of the sun at the proximity where the den evan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch if this works the satellites we orbit will produce light of such intensity that even someone in a closed darkened area will be affected by it\ncaptain youll need a host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body i am the logical choice\nthere ll be none on the planets surface doctor\nthe creature within me is gone i am free of it and the pain\nand im also quite blind an equitable trade doctor thank you\ninteresting just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans can not hear these creatures evidently are sensitive to light which we can not see\ndoctor it was my selection as well it is done\nan hereditary trait captain the brightness of the vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid which acts as a shield against high intensity light totally instinctive doctor we tend to ignore it as you ignore your own appendix\nquite the contrary captain i had a very strong reaction my first sight was the face of doctor mccoy bending over me\nmy pleasure captain\nwhy thank you doctor mccoy\ncaptain were picking up a ship on our sensors heading directly into the den evans un hell burn up\nhes too close captain\nhe burned up

there pairs\nyou d better check the starboard impulse packs those points have about decayed to lead\nim not joking lee you activate those packs and youll blow the whole impulse deck\nhes a fool a fool hed seen those points and he hadnt noticed their condition\nthe image of what he d seen was still in his mind\nim thirsty its like a man who has been blind all of his life suddenly being given sight sometimes i feel theres nothing i couldnt do in time some people think that makes me a monster dont they jim\ni can sense mainly worryin you jim safety of your ship\nprobably just what mister spock is thinking now kill me while you can\ni also know were orbiting delta vega jim i cant let you force me down the rei may not want to leave this ship not yet i may want another place im not sure yet just what kind of a world i can use\ni dont understand it all yet but if i keep growing getting stronger why the things i could do like like may be a god could do\nyou fools soon ill squash you like insects\nmy friend james kirk remember those rodent things on dim or us the poisoned darts they threw i took one meant for you\nso why be afraid of me now\ni was drugged then\nwhy dont you kill me then mister spock is right and your e a fool if you cant see it\nman can not survive if a race of true espers is born in time youll understand that\njim\nill just keep getting stronger you know that dont you\nyou should have killed me while you could james command and compassion is a fools mixture\nthen i shall make one behold youll soon share this feeling elizabeth to be like god to have the power to make the world anything you want it to be\na visitor a very foolish man youll enjoy being a god elizabeth blasphemy no let there be food kafer ian apples whenever we visited that planet i always favoured these can you hear me james you can not see me im not there you follow the right path james youll come to me soon\ngo to him elizabeth talk to him now that your e changing i want you to see just how unimportant they are\nim disappointed in you elizabeth ive been contemplating the death of an old friend he deserves a decent burial at least\nmorals are for men not gods\ntime to pray captain pray to me\npray that you die easily\nyour last chance kirk\nfor a moment james but your moment is fading\nlife sciences ready sir this is doctor dehner who joined the ship at the aldebaran colony\nthe only fact we have for sure is that the ss valiant was destroyed\nhes alive appears to be in shock\nperfect perfective never had a patient like you gary even the healthiest are generally off on some reading leaves\nit hit me too whatever it was kelso is dead strangled at least spock s alive\nshe went with mitchell\nyes there was some morning light they were headed across the valley to the left of the pointed peaks theres flatlands beyond\nbut captain\nmaterial is er ready sir\nyes sir its begun transmitting sir\nengineering division ready as always\nabout an hour ago the bridge controls started going crazy levers shifting by themselves buttons being pushed instrument readings changing\nit fits like a glove captain\noh did mister spock get the phaser rifle we sent down\nyour e a talented thief kelso everything you sent up seems to be fitting in place\nthe names smith sir\nyour move captain\nill have you check mated your next move\nirritating ah yes one of your earth emotions\nthe fact one of my ancestors married a human female\nnot large enough even for a lifeboat small enough to bring it aboard sir if you want to risk it\nmore like destroyed the ship in this case look at it burnt pitted\nhe played most illogically his next move should have been the rook\nthe tapes are burnt out trying the memory banks\ngetting something from the recorder now\ndecoding memory banks ill try to interpolate the valiant had encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this direction\nswept past this point about a half lightyear out of the galaxy they were thrown clear turned and headed back into the galaxy here im not getting it all the tapes are pretty badly burned sounds like the ship had encountered some unknown force now orders counter orders repeated urgent requests for information from the ships computer records for anything concerning in human beings\nsevere damage seven crewmen dead no make that six one crewman seemed to have recovered thats when they became interested in extrasensory perception more than interested almost frantic about it no this must be garbled i get something about destruct i must have read it wrong it sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy his own ship\nforce field of some kind\nsensor beam on\ndeflectors full intensity\ndeflectors say there s something there sensors say there is nt density negative radiation negative energy negative\nnegative\ndamage control reports all stations\nmain engines are out sir were on emergency power cells casualties nine dead\ni think we ve found that answer doctor\nbefore the valiant was destroyed its captain was frantically searching for information on his crew\nare there not also those who seem to see through solid objects cause fires to start spontaneously\ndoctor dehner is speaking of normal power\nhes reading even faster now than just a few moments ago is that gary mitchell the one you used to know\nour subject is not gary mitchell our concern is rather what he is mutating into\nhave you noted evidence of unusual powers\nand on my monitor screen i could see mitchell smiling each time it happened as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his amusement\nin less time than that he will have attained powers we cant understand and cant cope with soon well be not only useless to him but actually an annoyance\nwell never reach an earth base with him a board jim you heard the mathematics of it in a month hell have as much in common with us as wed have with a ship full of white mice\nrecommendation one theresa planet a few light days away from here delta vega it has a lithium cracking station we may be able to adapt some of its power packs to our engines\nit is the only possible way to get mitchell off this ship\nthen you have one other choice kill mitchell while you still can\nit is your only other choice assuming you make it while you still have time\nthe captain of the valiant probably felt the same way and he waited too long to make his decision i think weve both guessed that\nhes regaining consciousness\nfighting the force field drained his strength for a while at least he could be handled now\nhe tried to get through the force field again his eyes changed back faster he didnt become as weak\nbecause she feels i dont all i know is logic in my opinion well be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time\nif he should try to stop us\ni felt for him too\nastro sciences standing by captain\nif you want the mathematics of this mitchells ability is increasing geometrically that is like having a penny doubling it everyday in a month youll be a millionaire",

and strength which will cause ripples clear to the klingon empire\nyou will proceed to altair six as ordered you have your orders starfleet out\noh captain got a minute\nits spock have you noticed

the house down\nof course mister spock your reaction was quite logical\nin a pigs eye\nwhat is this\npoking and prying if i want anything from you ill ask for it\ncaptain i should like to request a leave of absence on my home planet on our present course you can divert to vulcan with a loss of but two point eight light days\ni have made my request captain all i require from you is that you answer it yes or no\nit is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is not hers\nyou have my request captain will you grant it or not\ncaptain surely i have enough leave time accumulated\nno nothing of that nature captain\nnoi must i wish to take my leave on vulcan\ni need rest im asking you to accept that answer\nthank you captain\nno were not captains log stardate

done so and no will go to my quarters\nexamine me for all the good itll do either of us\ncome\nit is a thing no out world er may know except those very few who have been involved a vulcan understands but even we do not speak of it among ourselves it is a deeply personal thing can you see that captain and understand\ncaptain there are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service\nit has to do with biology\nbiology\nvulcan biology\nthe birds and the bees are not vulcans captain if they were if any creature as proudly logical asus were to have their logic ripped from them as this time does to us how do vulcans choose their mates havent you wondered\nnono it is not we shield it with ritual and customs shrouded in antiquity you humans have no conception it strips our minds from us it brings a madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation it is the pon farr the time of mating there are precedents in nature captain the giant eel birds of regulus five once each eleven years they must return to the caverns where they hatched on your earth the salmon they must return to that one stream where they were born to spawn or die in trying\nnon or ami am anima vulcan id hoped i would be spared this but the ancient drives are too strong eventually they catch up with us and we are driven by forces we can not control to return home and take a wife or die\nlet me alone let me alone\nmiss chapel\ni had a most startling dream you were trying to tell me something but i couldnt hear you it would be illogical for us to protest against our natures dont you think\nyour face is wet\nvulcan miss chapel\nyes i know christine would you make me some of that plo meek soup\nit is obvious that you have surmised my problem doctor my compliments on your insight captain there is a thing that happens to vulcans at this time almost an insanity which you would no doubt find distasteful\nthen would you beam down to the planets surface and stand with me there is a brief ceremony\nit is my right by tradition the male is accompanied by his closest friends\ni also request mccoy accompany me\nthis is spock\ntp ring parted from me and never parted never and always

preferring ston n over me\nlogical flawlessly logical\nston n she is yours after a time you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting it is not logical but it is often true spock here standby to beam up live long t pau and prosper\ni shall do neither i have killed my captain and my friend energize\ndoctor i shall be resigning my commission immediately of course\nso i

apollo thats your business but you reno god to us mister\nand you ve got a lot to learn\nanalysis lieutenant palamas what do you know about apollo\nand this thing\ni think the appearance of this is for our benefit bones\nfine but what power and where is it scout around with your tricorder s find the source of that power bones\nbones i wonder if five thousand years ago\ni have an idea what if he is really apollo\napollo were willing to talk but you ll find we dont bow to every creature who happens to have a bag of tricks\ni have four hundred and thirty people on that ship up there\nscotty very impressive how d you do it\nbone show is he\nhe would have been rather difficult to stop\nmister chekov i think you d better continue your investigation\nhow do you feel scotty\nit would seem so\nmister scott i understand your concern over her but she volunteered to go with him hopefully to find out more about him shes doing her job i think its about time you started doing yours we ve got to find out the source of his power you ve got a tricorder use it if youre able to\nand one more thing i want no more unauthorised action against apollo or whatever he is that san order\nbesides you stiff necked thistle head you could have gotten yourself killed\napollos no god but he could have been taken for one though once say five thousand years ago a highly sophisticated group of space travellers landed on earth around the mediterranean\nespecially if they had the power to alter their format will and command great energy in fact they couldnt have been taken for anything else\nive just picked up readings for our own people sir\napollo has no difficulty focusing he taps that energy mister scott\nare you suggesting that he apollo taps a flow of energy and channels it through his body\nmister chekov i think youve earned your pay for the week but where is the source of that power\nis that all you have to offer\nbones is it possible\nwheres lieutenant palamas\nscotty\nall right mister you wanted worshippers you ve got enemies you want us to bow down youll have to\ntake care of scotty\nwheres apollo\ndont you mean the english story the cheshire cat\nall right allright all right\nvery good mister chekov that might very well mean something\nwe ve got to get out of here\nwell lets assume that five thousand years ago creatures like our friend apollo did indeed visit earth and form the basis of the greek classic myths\nmost mythology has its basis in fact if i remember my ancient legends the gods after expending energy required rest even as we humans\nsomething like that remember hes keeping a force field on the ship and he sex pending energy down here you said he looked pained and tired when he disappeared if we can wear him out over work him that might do it\nif we can provoke him so that he strikes one of us again theres a chance that hell be drained enough so the rest of us can jump him\nnot all of us bones when he comes back its a chance well have to take\nyou know nothing about our kind you know only our remote ancestors who trembled before your tricks your tricks dont frighten us neither do you weve come along way in five thousand

the ship depend on you\non you lieutenant reject him and we have a chance to save ourselves accept him and you condemn all of us to slavery nothing less than slavery we might never get help this far

same history the same heritage the same lives were tied together beyond any untying manor woman it makes no difference were human we couldnt escape from each other even if we wanted to that show you

with\nif that structure is the source of his power i want to know where he is when we attack it\nkirk out\nbones do you think that mysterious organ in apollos chest could have something to do with the

power lieutenant overloaded and burned out\nnomad\nnegative captain it has a protective screen i can not get through\na reasonable course\nit is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer\nan opinion is a belief a view a judgment\nyes it was reported destroyed there were no more in the series but if this is that probe\nchart 14asir\ni believe the history computer can answer that question ill have the readout in a moment\nthe usage is correct the creator was simply testing your memory banks\nive correlated all the available information on the nomad probe and im convinced that this object is indeed that probe\ntrue\npresumed destroyed by a meteor collision i submit that it was badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself\nthis is the creator of nomad perhaps the most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time his dream was to build a perfect thinking machine capable of independent logic you recall his name\nyes similar captain i believe that nomad thinks you are roy kirk that may well be why the attack was broken off it responded to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted\nessentially it is doctor i believe that more happened to it than just damage in the meteor collision it mentioned the other the unanswered question is the other what nomad was a thinking machine the best that could be engineered it was a prototype\nprecisely doctor and somehow that programming has been changed it would seem that nomad is now seeking out perfect life forms perfection being measured by its own relentless logic\ncaptain mister singh reports that nomad is no longer in the auxiliary control room\nthat unit is a woman\nnomad i have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed of the computer please do not draw the information faster than the machines capacity\nfascinating\nwell doctor\ncaptain if that is correct if there has been no brain damage but only knowledge erased she could be re educated\ndoes the creator wish nomad to wait elsewhere\ndoctor i interrupted you because nomad would not have understood your anger it has great technical skill but its reaction to emotion is unpredictable it almost qualifies as a life form\nthe study of it would be of great use captain\nan almost human stubbornness captain i have been unable to convince nomad to lower its screens for analysis without its cooperation i can do nothing\nthank you\nit is not sufficient captain i get certain references to the accident the other but nothing clear there are areas i simply can not scan\ncaptain i suggest the vulcan mind probe\nit seems the only way\nthere is a risk but i have formed a partial hypothesis i must check it out\ni am nomad i am performing my function deep emptiness it approaches collision damage blackness i am the other

are nomad we are complete we are instructed our purpose is clear sterilise imperfections sterilise imperfections nomad sterilise sterilise nomad sterilise\nfascinating captain the knowledge the depth\nit was it was damaged in deep space undoubtedly the meteor collision its memory banks were destroyed or most of them it wandered without purpose and then it met the other the other was an alien probe of great power somehow they merged repaired each other became one\nnot the nomad we lost from earth it took from the other a new directive to replace its own the other was originally programmed to secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets probably as a prelude to colonisation\ni beg your pardon\nyes its powerful its sophisticated but its not infallible its space happy it thinks im its mother\nand that is the only thing that has saved us until now yes\ncaptain ive examined the brig the force field door on the security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished i must assume they are dead\ni suspect it is about to reevaluate its creator captain it may have been unwise to admit to nomad that you are a biological unit in nomads eyes you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect\neven worse nomad just now made a reference to its launch point earth\ni do not believe there is much beyond nomads capabilities\nit will find the earth infested with imperfect biological units\nno response\nsince it specifically examined your history i suggest it has completed its reevaluation\nundoubtedly\nyour logic was impeccable captain we are in grave danger\nmy congratulations

beamed back to the enterprise and found it and the personnel aboard changed the ship is subtly altered physically behaviour and discipline has become brutal savage\nmister spock\nthe power beam jumped

going to make me a chief you could make me an officer\na commission\nyes sir\ni fell asleep we had quite a time in the chemlab picking up after the storm nothing compared to your day i gather i heard about chekov\nyou got lucky im surprised you could be caught off guard that way\nyour e still in trouble with starfleet command what you ve got in mind this time is beyond me your e scheming of course the hal kans have something you want or is it all some clever means to advance you to the admiralty kirk the cabinet itself\nreally well you must know what you redoing you always do if im to be the woman of a caesar cant i know what your e up to\nlets drink a toast to spock the only man aboard with the decency to warn you and hell die for it theyll never find another man like him\nare you going to act against the hal kans before the deadline\njust get him out of the way he and his men\nshall i activate the tantalus field youll at least want to monitor him wont you\ni hate this thing\nof course not it made you captain how many enemies have you simply wiped out of existence by the touch of a button fifty a hundred now i always thought that was funny the great powerful captain kirk who owes everything to some unknown alien scientist and a plundered laboratory\nyou dont rise to the command of a starship or even higher\nthat magnificent mind of his but it cant protect him from this i pressit and he dies now\nyou really mean it it doesnt matter if spock fails his order hell be killed anyway\nyour e not even afraid of starfleet command can your scheme bring you that much power so quickly and what about me how does marlena fit in\noiling my traps darling im afraid im a little out of practice may be thats what happened to us its very hard for a working officer to shine as a woman every minute and you demand perfection\ni remember when you used to talk that way\nprove it\nships business an important task on the crew deck well i guess its over commander ken no will take me temporarily hes made that quite clear ill call a yeoman to help me with my things\nare you feeling sorry for me doi see hesitation in your eyes about anything i want one thing captain transfer me on the enterprise i am humiliated on another ship i can hunt fresh game ive got my rank and dont i ive been a captains woman and i like it ill be one again if i have to go through every officer in the

what theyll do to me\nwhat about me\ncaptain kirk\nmarlena moreau i was just assigned last week\nyes sir\nwhat is this everythings all messed up and changed around out of place\nno not everything that spot i spilt acid there a year ago jim what in blazes is this\nan exchange if were here\nwhat about the hal kans we cant let them be destroyed\nhere here whats this\nand my sickbay is a chamber of horrors my assistants were betting on the tolerance of an injured man how long it would take him to pass out from the pain\nim a doctor not an engineer\njim the way this ship is run what kind of people are we in this universe\njim if were here what do you suppose our counterparts doing back in our universe\nthat ought to hold him for about six hours\nnow its up to the captain\nhelp me get him on the table wellcome on help me get him on the table hell die without immediate treatment\nwell get home this wont take long marlena is still watching on the tantalus screen\nshutup i can save his life\ndo you want me to stop jim itll only take a minute\na little time hell live\ni cant let him die jim you get onto the transporter room ill be there in five minutes\ni guarantee it now go on please\njimi think i liked him with a beard better it gave him character of course almost any change would be a distinct improvement\nim sure\ncaptain what is all this\naye\ni did\ncaptain the transporter chief mentioned a surge of power the transporter lock might have been affected by the ion storm and we just materialised somewhere else\naye sir\naye sir\nive been ordered to check phaser couplings for possible damage by the storm\ncaptains orders\nnever mind ill attend to it\nphaser report sir no damage\nmister sulu is security chief like the ancient gestapo\nmostly variations in instrumentation nothing i cant handle\neverythings exactly where it should be except us\nnot by myself ill need help and youd be too conspicuous\nnow youre an engineer ill have to tap the power we need from the warp engines and balance it for the four of us\ncaptain we can do it\nwe have to lay in the automatic transporter setting but when we interrupt engine circuits to tie the power increase into the transporter itll show up on sul us security board of course well only need a second\nscotty here sir\nwe ve got another deadline too sir\nthe two way matter transmission affected the local field density between the universes and its increasing we ve got to move fast\nhalf hour at the most\nwe couldnt get out of herein a century were ready to bridge power from the engines to the

gotten minutes\nits working sir\nfive minutes sir\nthe powers cut sir theyre on to us\naye its available\ni can get us the power but the automatic setting is linked to the transporter main if we

well try and find out whats going on down here kirk out\nsome kind of generator\nwhats that\npeculiar stuff to find in paradise\nspock spock security alert is he alive\nkirk to enterprise\nwere beaming up notify transporter room and make arrangements to pick up mallory and marple theyre scouting ahead of us\nall hands\nenergise\nscotty energise scotty whats the matter\nscotty is the transporter malfunction tied in with trouble your e having with the antimatter pods\nspock are you all right\njust what do you think you were trying to do\nstepped in front and took the thorns yourself\ni see well next time just yell i can step out of the way as quickly as the next man\ntrying to get yourself killed do you know how much starfleet has invested in you\nnever mind but thanks kaplan take the post\nnot only is something after us but its after the ship as well\nthirty seconds ago there was nt a cloud in the sky\ncome on\nphasers a beautiful day mister spock not a cloud in the sky just like paradise\nkirk here\nmallory mallory you all right come in\nmallory mallory you all right mallory\non the double\nmallory marple stand back watch it the rocks kaplan hen dorff i know kaplan s family now mallory\nhis father helped me get into the academy\ni couldve prevented all of it\na walk in paradise among the green grass and flowers we should ve beamed up at the first sign of trouble\ni also have the option to disregard those orders if i consider them overly hazardous this isnt that important a mission spock not worth the lives of three of my men i drop my guard for a minute because i like the smell of growing things and now three men are dead and the ships in trouble\nmarple chekov at attention gentlemen something or someone is behind that rock i want it marple cut around the rock to your right make a loud noise be careful spock you and chekov create a diversion and make it loud\ni wont hurt you do you understand i wont hurt you\nwell i wont strike you again you ve been following us watching us why\nwho is vaal\ndo you have a name\ntheyre not going to hurt you i promise you a kuta a kuta we come in peace we would like to speak to this vaal\nantennae\nyou speak of the people of vaal are they nearby\nkirk here\nscotty are the warp drives still out\nput it on maximum full emergency circuits\nstatus are you still holding\nmaintain full reverse thrust against the pull put a team on that warp drive get it working\nscotty your e my chief engineer you know everything about that ship there is to know more than the men who designed it if you cant get those warp engines working\nyour e fired\ntell me about vaal\ntake me to him i wish to speak to him\nill take my chances\nbut this is not the centre mister spock\na force field\nyou all right\na kuta how do you talk to vaal\nwell we cant get to it we cant talk to it unless it wants to talk to us\nwhen does he get hungry\nwhere are the others\nthe children\nlittle ones like yourselves they grow\nwell thankyou it does something for you\nnothing makes sense down here kirk to enterprise\nstatus report scotty\nim sick of hearing that word cant get that ship out of there\nthen use your imagination tie every ounce of power the ship has into the impulse engines discard the warp drive nacelles if you have to and crack out of there with the main section but get that ship out of there\ndo it kirk out\nreport\ni see opinion\nadd to that a simple diet a perfectly controlled temperature no natural enemies apparently novices no replacements needed maybe it is paradise after all\nmister spock\nwell the fields down people are going in lets see what kind of luck we have\nthats not the way\nbut it needs to eat frequently so it cant have any great power reserves\nwhat happens if vaal weakens around feeding time spock check the electromagnetic section of the astrophysics lab get an estimate of the total amount of energy being expended against the ship have them measure it hour by hour\nmess call\ngentlemen i think this philosophical argument can wait until our ships out of danger kirk here\ndid it maintain scotty\ngood keep monitoring how are you coming along with the circuit switchover\nthats cutting it a bit fine scotty\nkirk out\nyeoman your e wasting energy\nsit down and have something to eat\nthat hasnt happened yet i wonder what would happen yeoman speculate what would happen if someone on this planet died\naccidents happen\nthey d need a replacement opinion mister spock\nmister spock your e the science officer why dont you explain it to the young lady\nbones was right these people are nt living theyre existing they dont create they dont produce they dont even think they exist to service a machine\nthese are people not robots they should have the opportunity of choice we owe it to them to interfere\nill take my chances why dont you have a look around kirk to enterprise mister scott\nhow sit going scotty\nyou realise that within forty five minutes the ship will be pulled down into the atmosphere\nyes i\nkirk out what is it\nvaal we are on a peaceful mission we mean no harm to you or your people\nlets get out of here\nbones\nmarple\nput them in the hut find out where the women are put them in there too\nall right scotty put her in full reverse get her out of there\nscotty what happened\nyour e fired four hundred people\ntheyll die because i couldnt see a warning sign i had to follow orders always orders\nbones thats it stay with chekov keep those people from feeding vaal dont let them feed vaal keep them in the hut mister spock\nscotty do you still have phaser power\nlock all banks on the coordinates of the energy field located down here kirk on my command commence firing on those coordinates\nif my guess is correct they wont have to stand by\ntapping its energy cells\ngood the ships pulling away must have weakened it considerable it has to be fed but its reserve capacity could hold out for days\nmy plan exactly scotty\nscotty commence firing and maintain\ngood lets see how long he can do it\nscotty ceasefire\nmister scott status report\nscotty your e rehired as soon as the transporters fixed form an engineering detail with full analytical equipment and beam them down kirk out chekov bones let those people go\nyoull learn to care for yourselves with our help and theres no trick to putting fruit on trees you might enjoy it youll learn to build for yourselves think for yourselves work for yourselves and what you create is yours thats what we call freedom youll like it alot and youll learn something about men and women the way they re supposed to be caring for each other being happy with each other being good to each other thats what we call love youll like that too a lot you and your children\nthe little ones look like you just go on the way your e going you ll find out\nwell thats a good object lesson mister spock its an example of what can happen when a machine becomes too efficient does too much work for you\nyes of course im aware of it adam and eve tasted the apple and as a result were driven out of paradise\ndoctor doi understand him correctly are you casting me in

seem to have a problem here too\nwere losing potency in our antimatter pods i dont think its serious but were looking into it\nim not sure sir but weve run measurements on the electromagnetic field of the planet and they are a wee bit abnormal that might have something to do with it\nwell sir i didnt exactly say that\ni hear its nice down there\ni could do with a nice walk in a garden with green leaves and grass\nenterprise to captain kirk\nscott sir our antimatter pods are completely inert\ni couldnt stop it but i know why\nsomething from the surface its like a pail of water on a fire a beam maybe or a transmission and its still on im having it analysed but its like nothing ive seen before\nand its pinpointed in the area of that village we located down there\ntheres nothing you can do about it sir\nthere doesnt seem to be any immediate danger\nscott here sir\naye aye sir transporter room standby to beam up landing party\nstanding by sir\nenergise\nwe cant make transporter contact

kyle\nive done that captain they havent been able to do a thing its no good captain with maximum thrust against the pull\nwell only be able to maintain full power for sixteen hours then we burn up for sure\nill do everything there is to do sir scott out\nscott here\nno change captain the orbit is decaying along computed lines no success with the warp drive were going down and we cant stop it\nsir were doing everything within engineering reason\nsir im going to switch over everything but the life support systems and boost the impulse power but thats just about as dangerous\nscotty sir we have a reading on the power source mister spock requested when we first monitored it was generating alternating cycles totalling one hundred to the twentieth power waltham units\nno sir powers dropping bit by bit nominal but a definite drain\nwere putting everything but the kitchen sink into impulse power sir it will take us another eight hours to complete the work\naye but if we dont breakout id rather we didnt have to wait too long for the end of it\nhere sir\nalmost ready sir we need half an hour yet\ni know that as you said thats cutting things fine\nwere ready here sir all available power has been channelled into the impulse engines we have twelve minutes before entering atmosphere\nfull reverse mister kyle all engines\ncaptain were doing it were pulling away\ncaptain weve pulled away a little we gained may be an hour but we blew almost every system in the ship doing it\ntheres nothing left to try again i guess you ll have to fire me sir\naye but what\naye sir but they wont penetrate that force field\nscott here sir\nmister kyle all phasers commence firing\ntractor beam gone potency returning to antimatter pods\nill have all engineering sections working on the circuits immediately transporter ll be ready in an hour\nthe soil here is remarkably rich and fertile captain husbandry would be quite efficacious\noh quite sure readings indicate the entire planet is covered with growth

the way\ni shall do so\none hundred twenty two thousand two hundred\ncaptain to affect the ship at this extreme range would require a highly sophisticated planetary defence system\ncaptain those coordinates are a short distance in that direction\ncaptain in each case this was unavoidable\ni dont see how\nyou are under orders to investigate this planet and this culture\nno one has ever stated that starfleet duty was particularly safe youve followed the correct and logical course done everything a commander could do self recriminations captain our friend is back\nmister chekov your tricorder readings are totally inefficient\nensign i will not have you address me in that tone of voice\ncaptain this is fascinating if you will permit me sir\nfascinating a very high order of

feet beyond the figure in all directions conventional in composition and quite formidable\nyes indeed it does captain it makes me uncomfortable\nyes spock i am spock\ni fail to see what they find so amusing\nquite possible it checks with my atmospheric analysis their atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun\napparently our hypothesis is correct there is no living being there it is a machine nothing more\nevidently not this is no ordinary machine captain it may well possess a rudimentary intelligence\nthat may not be of any help the enterprise has only ten hours left in which to break free\nacknowledged\nin my view a splendid example of reciprocity\ndoctor you insist on applying human standards to nonhuman cultures i remind you that humans are only a tiny minority in this galaxy\nanother is their right to choose a system which seems to work for them\ndoctor these people are healthy and they are happy whatever you choose to call it this system works despite your emotional reaction to it\ni see no alternative\nwell i believe its safe safe to assume that they would receive the necessary instructions\ni am concerned captain this may not be an ideal society but

understatement\nthe good doctor was concerned that the vaal ians achieved true human stature i submit there is no cause for worry theyve taken the first step theyve learned to kill\nreadings are getting weaker captain wide variation in energy transmissions as though vaal were trying to draw on other sources\ni would assume so\nif it had to reinforce its energy field toward off a phaser attack it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves\na tremendous upsurge in generated power captain obviously vaal is trying to reinforce his energy field\nno power generation at all captain vaal is dead\nthats not unusual doctor\ncaptain im not at all certain we did the correct thing on gamma triang uli six\ncaptain you are aware of the biblical story of genesis\nprecisely captain and in a manner of speaking we have given the people of vaal the apple the knowledge of good and evil if you will as a result of which they too have been driven out of paradise\nnot at all captain\ni am not

megatons will result if a starship impulse engine is overloaded\nninety seven point eight three five will it be powerful enough to destroy that thing out there\nnot through it spock from inside it will it be enough\ndo the best you can and make it fast kirk to scott\ngood scotty can you set the ships impulse engines to overload\naye sir\nset it and get up here as fast as you can\nspock you dont know\ni intend to get a lot closer im going to ram her right down that things throat\nnono i dont intend to die mister spock weve rigged a delay detonation device youll have thirty seconds to be am me aboard the enterprise before the constellations impulse engines blow\na calculated risk mister spock\na chance ill have to take kirk out\nwhat about the detonator\nunderstood mister spock prepare to

beam me a board\nmister sulu easeus back to minimum headway conserve power as much as possible lieutenant palmer tell mister scott to expedite repairs on the warp drive poor matt he gave his life in an attempt to save others not the worst way to go\nindeed it shall mister spock ironic isnt it way back in the 20thcenturythehbomb was the ultimate weapon their doomsday machine and we used something

to have a look at those engines\ncaptain ive checked the engines the warp drive is a hopeless pile of junk the impulse engines are not too badly off we ought to be able to do something with them\nexhausted they didnt give up without a battle\ncomputer system is still intact we can playback the duplicate captains log from the auxiliary control room\nready with the duplicate log

for one man to handle\naye sir\ncontrols are all hooked up sir we should have some power for you soon\ncoming sir if i push these impulse engines too hard in the condition theyre in theyll blow apart\naye sir spock sir deflector shields are gone\nyou ve got it captain just enough to move us i cant do better\ncaptain i still dont know what were doing\nphasers you ve got emi have one bank recharged\ncaptain kirk\nive hooked in ships communication the best i can give you on impulse is one third power the shields are up but they wont last long\nhere sir the damage control party just beamed back to the enterprise\naye the shape the things in its hard to keep her from blowing i want you to riga thirty second delay detonation device and rig it so that it can be blown from up here\naye sir\nright away\na cranky transporters a mighty finicky piece of machinery to be gambling your life on sir\nive linked it in with the impulse control system its armed now press this one thirty seconds later poof once its activated theres no way to stop it\ngood luck captain\nwhats the matter with that thing\nitll never work like this its the main junction circuitry ill get it\nbridge transporter operational but this jury rigging wont last for long hes got to come off now\nill standby here\noch whats wrong with it\ntry her now mister kyle\ncaptain sensors show this entire solar system has been destroyed nothing left but rubble and asteroids\nnonetheless captain sensors show nothing but debris where we charted seven planets last year\ncaptain the two innermost planets of this system appear to be intact\ni have it on the sensors captain by configuration a starship stopped in spaces he appears to be drifting\nsensors not recording normal energy output\nshe may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar systems\nall power plants dead reserve energy banks operative at a very low power level\nalso operative at a low power level the entire bridge is damaged and

temperature of the inner planet is that of molten lead the other has an atmosphere poisonous to human life\nspock here captain\nunable to raise starfleet command due to heavy subspace interference\nattempting to remedy\nshe was attacked by what appears to be essentially a robot an automated weapon of immense size and power its apparent function is to smash planets to rubble and then digest the debris for fuel it is therefore self sustaining as long as there are planetary bodies for it to feed on\nunknown captain however mister sulu has computed the path of the machine using the destroyed solar systems as a base course projecting back on our star charts we find that it came from outside from another galaxy\nif it follows its present path it will go through the most densely populated section of our galaxy\nred alert red alert\nit came upon us fast captain but we seem able to maintain our distance\nit looks very much like commodore deckers planet killer and it is pursuing us\nwe are more manoeuvrable but it is gaining on us sensors indicate some kind of total conversion drive\nno evidence of life subspace interference level incredibly high\ni would say none captain the energy generated by our power nacelles seems to attract siti doubt we could manoeuvre close enough without drawing a direct attack upon ourselves\ni also believe the nature of this machine precludes the possibility of easy access to its control mechanisms\nclosing captain\nacknowledged\ntransporter room standby to beam landing party aboard\nevasive action mister sulu\ndamage report all

ignore anything as small as a ship beyond a certain radius well maintain a discreet distance and circle back to pick up the captain\ni am aware of the rigel systems population commodore but we are only one ship our deflector shields a restrained our subspace transmitter is useless logically our primary duty is to survive in order to warn starfleet command\nmister sulu you will lay in an evasive course back to the constellation\nyou will carry out my last order mister sulu\nyou have the right to do so but i would advise against it\nyou tried to destroy it once before commodore the result was a wrecked ship and a dead crew\nsensors show the objects hull is solid neutron iuma single ship can not combat it\nunfortunately starfleet order 104 section b leaves me no alternative paragraph 1a clearly states\nif you can certify commodore decker medically or psychologically unfit for command i can relieve him under section c\nyoull also be asked to produce your medical records to prove it\nthen your statement would not be considered valid\ndeflector shields at full power they cant take much more of this\ndeflectors holding but weakening we must retreat commodore the energy drain\ncommodore i urgently recommend immediate withdrawal\nit has ceased fire were being held in a tractor beam were being pulled inside commodore you must veer off\nwe have lost warp power if we dont break the tractor beam within sixty seconds we never will\nthat sir is illogical it is suicide attempted suicide would be proof that you are psychologically unfit for command if you dont veer offishall relieve you on that basis\nemergency impulse power\nits closing fast on the constellation\ncommodore i suggest\nthis machine seems to have a programmed defensive sphere any energy source entering that field is subject to attack\nwarp drive and deflectors will be out for a solar day repairs proceeding on transporter and communications\nwe can maintain this speed for only seven hours before we exhaust our fuel but it can refuel itself indefinitely\nillogical we can not destroy it therefore we can not save rigel we must transport the captain and the others from the constellation and escape this things subspace interference in order to warn starfleet command\ncan you raise starfleet\non audio lieutenant\ncommodore\nwarp drive out deflector shields down transporter under repair we are on emergency impulse power\nat least one solar day\nat our present rate of consumption well exhaust our impulse power long before then\ncommodore decker you are relieved of command\nyou may

constellation come in please\ncaptain kirk come in please\nsir may ioffer my condolences on the death of your friend it is most regrettable\nthe drop in power is definite captain but negligible the

the deneb ians contacted the vulcans\nthats what i would have done\nhe broke jail\nhe stole a spaceship\nthey fired at him\ngo on get on with it harry\nthey picked a fine representative\ni think not harry\nwho\nyesmyship2\nnorman who created you\nwhat became of them\nthen some of your makers survive\nall right we might later in the meantime would you mind leaving us\nbecause we dont like you now\nwell opinions\nthats a great help mister chekov bones\nspock and if you say were in a lot of trouble\ntry and find it the rest of you look around learn everything you can ill see what else i can find out from mister mudd lets go norman is behind a console whilst two hermans standby\nvery impressive\ni must say i like the styling\ndont you believe in male androids harry\ndont lose your head bones nobodys staying anywhere\nscotty you were ordered to stay aboard\nwhat does she mean the last one\nare you out of your mind you cant be am down an entire crew of a spaceship somebody has to be on board\nharry harry youll never get away with it\nstarfleet\nim trying not to\nyes i know thats what worries me how will my crew react in a world where they can have everything they want simply by asking for it\nis that the way your e going to do it mudd hit my people at their weakest point\nall right here we are birds in a gilded cage the question is how do we get out of here\nall right were getting back to the ship and dont you forget it straighten up this may be a gilded cage filled with everything you always wanted but its still a cage we dont belong here we belong on that ship up there 471\nnoyesmyship471\nto respond in that area\nyesiknow471\nalice give us back our ship to please us return us to our ship because we desire it471\nbut were unhappy here 471\nwe want the enterprise 471\nno its a beautiful lady and we love her 471\ninteresting\nbones have you had time to take any psychological readings of the androids\nyes thats what this crew needs a little sense of purpose\nmudd a few questions i want to ask you\nyes my ship\nharry i think they have something else in mind\nwe prefer to help ourselves we make mistakes but were human and may be thats the word that best explains us\nthe whole galaxy controlled by your kind\nso far this thing has had its amusing aspects but that threat the androids made about taking over all the humans in the galaxy is not very funny\nwhy shouldnt they answer our questions they dont think we can do anything to stop them\nall right what have we got to work with\ni agree what in your opinion does direct them\nnorman when it old one of the alices that the enterprise was a lovely lady and we loved her she said norman coordinate why norman unless\nnamed norman forming one gigantic highly intelligent mind and the glowing badges they indicate the mind in operation\nyes logical thats what it is and that in turn gives us a weapon that we can use against them we must use wild insane irrational illogic aimed right at norman\nlets get to the point harry you said you wanted to help do you\nthats fine harry the androids will be expecting us to make a break for it and thats where you come in\nnothing harry just go to sleep\noh harry i do believe your e putting on weight 1\nwe have a medical problem your exlordharrymudd1\nwe are caring for him but our doctor needs his medical equipment aboard the enterprise 1\nyou are programmed to serve if were not allowed access to our medical equipment harry mudd will die he will cease to function you will have failed to serve 1\noh yes\nuhura why did you tell her\nuhura beautiful\nnext we take the alice son a trip through wonderland 1182\nyes your attention 2\ntheyre celebrating 118\ntheir captivity do you enjoy the music 118\nshe likes him mister chekov the floor is no place for an officer attention now stand absolutely still\nthats better mister chekov118\nyour statement is illogical\ngood i wonder how spock s doing\nwell\nif norman is the control centre he should be in a bind by what weve done if we can overload him further we should be able to immobilise all of them does everybody remember what to do\nacknowledged\ni want you to surrender\nno we are stronger ill prove it to you can you harm a man that you reprogrammed to serve\nwhy not\nscotty scotty s dead he had too much happiness but now hes happier hes dead and well miss him let us hear it for our poor dead friend\nwhat is a man but that lofty spirit that sense of enterprise that devotion to something that can not be sensed can not be realised but only dreamed the highest reality\nhow did you like it\nour logic is to be illogical that is our advantage mister spock it is time the explosive\nwatch it watch it\nno observe fore boom\nare you all right\nhe lied everything harry tells you is a lie remember that everything harry tells you is a lie\ni am not programmed to respond in that area\ngood\nwhy thank you\na partnership arrangement you and me\nive got something else in mind lets go\ntouch bones\nyes mudd you ve been paroled to the android population of this planet\nno your e an irritant youll stay here and provide a first class example to the androids of a human failure theyll learn by close observation how to avoid ones like you in the future\nas long as you continue to be an irritant harry its up to you\nyes you are oh theres one more thing harry weve programmed a special android attendant to take care of your every need shell help you find an incentive to work with the androids and not exploit them\nyes1\ngoodbye harry have fun back to the episode listing star

man who never smiles whose conversation never varies from the routine of the job and who wont talk about his background\nspock i mean that its odd for a non vulcan the ears make all the difference\nmaybe but you cant evaluate a man by logical one besides he has avoided two appointments that ive made for his physical exam without reason\nohi find that shocking\nharry whats this\ndead\nthats very interesting you leave your wife and then bring her along\nthen your makers werent humanoid\ni think mister chekov s right we are in a lot of trouble\njim you should see the research facilities they ve got a lab down there that well i could spend the rest of my life studying it\ni wouldnt be bored i can tell you that\ni did and you can forget it theyre perfect flawless mentally and physically no weaknesses perfectly disciplined novices no fears no faults just a sense of purpose believe me theres nothing tougher to overcome even among humans\nhow do you know so much\noh\nyou wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself\nhe is dying 1\ncompletely inner directed oblivious to everything\nall right its worked so far but were not out yet\nyou offer us only wellbeing\nsuffering in torment and pain labouring without end\nhes dead\neasy now oh hes caught it\nwell you must be very unhappy mister spock\nwell we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours logical unemotional completely pragmatic and we poor irrational humans whipped them in a fair fight now you ll find yourself back among us illogical humans again\nwelcome aboard kirk its been a long time eh\nwell to be absolutely accurate laddy buck you should refer to me as mudd the first ruler of this entire sovereign planet\nwell im afraid theres a bit of a problem there\nalice\nnow now now now jamie boy lets have no unauthorised communications\ncome now\nentrepreneur\ndid i leave you with that impression\nand thereby hangs a tale yes but look around you kirk quite a place isnt it i hope your e all going to enjoy it\ni shall do that kirk when im ready\nand i do the telling on this planet kirk old boy you do the listening\nmerely that you might as well start enjoying yourselves its really a very very nice place and your e all going to be here quite probably for the rest of your lives\nsorry that dbe against the law my law decreed by mudd the first voted in by the resident population lovely arent they you must admit kirk that i still retain my eye for beauty i decreed that i should always be surrounded by it and my decrees always come to passive had five hundred of them made up to attend me all of them identical beautiful compliant obedient\ni have a fondness for this particular model mister spock which you unfortunately are ill equipped to appreciate\nyes well i organised a technical information service bringing modern industrial techniques to backward planets making available certain valuable patents to struggling young civilisations throughout the galaxy\nwell actually kirk as a defender of the free enterprise system i found myself in a rather ambiguous conflict as a matter of principle\nknowledge sir should be free to all\nthat sir is an outrageous assumption\nisold the deneb ians all the rights to a vulcan fuel synthesiser\nhow d you know\nits typical police mentality they ve got no sense of humour they arrested me\nworse than that do know what the penalty for fraud is on deneb five\nthe keyword in your entire peroration mister spock was death barbarians well of course i left\ni borrowed transportation\nthe patrol reacted in a hostile manner\ntheyve no respect for private property they damaged the bloody spaceship well i got away but i couldnt navigate so i wandered out through unmapped space and here i found mudd\nspock your e going to love it here they all talk just the way you do\nyes well right laddy buck so here iam in a planet with over two hundred thousand hard working happy androids all of whom exist merely to serve my every whim its absolute paradise\nthey wont let me go they want to study me they want to learn more about human beings\nwatch your tongue lady our e talking about mudd the first well anyway iran out of ideas i simply ran out of things for them to do and they insisted that i bring them more human beings they need human beings to serve to study so i had to promise them a prime sample a starship captain bright loyal fearless and imaginative any captain would have done i was lucky to get you so you are going to take over for me here and i can get off this rock and back to civilisation\nyou misunderstand mela dim not asking you im telling you youve no choice show them to their quarters and\nah that gentlemen is a shrine to the memory of my beloved stella\nstella my wife\noh no no no merely deserted you see gentlemen behind every great man there is a woman urging him on and so it was with my stella she urged me on into outer space not that she meant to but with her continual eternal confounded nagging well i think of her constantly and everytime i doi go further out into space\ni had the androids construct a perfect replica of stella so that i could gaze upon her and rejoice in her absence gentlemen attend stella dear\nshut up\nmarvellous isnt it i finally have the last word with her and with you\nthey were of course made to my personal specifications as indeed were the maisie series the trudie series and particularly the annabel series\nmale well i suppose they have their uses\nimmortality and eternal beauty\nim so glad you enjoyed it doctor\ni do so admire a man who devotes himself to knowledge\nstubborn kirk stubborn\nsplendid splendid welcome to mudd mister scott\ndidnt i tell you kirk i beamed a few dozen androids up to your ship they ve been sending your crew to the surface for the past couple of hours theyre all down now\nthere is an entire crew aboard an entire crew of androids they learn very quickly captain the fact is ive taken over your whole ship theres nothing you can do about it\nwell whos to stop me\nbut now captain now i have a ship of my own as fast as any in the fleet so how will they catch me eh just think of it laddy buck harry mudd with his own crew of lovelies aboard your vessel think about that\nalice\nafraid i wont have time to answer them my bags are all packed the androids will take the enterprise out of orbit in less than twenty four hours but its been a real pleasure having you here kirk is there anything i can get for you\nyour e a stubborn fellow arent you but i dont mind i dont mind that at all because ill be leaving here quickly enough and then you can be stubborn at your own leisure one last time stella dear\nshut up\nalice number 2my little love will you have my bags transported up to the ship\nwhat\nwhy not\nyes but thats what im saying put my bags on the ship\nnow look here you cant do that now listen to serve us you must obey us\nalice number one obey me put my bags on that ship\ntake my word for it they can\nyour e so smart kirk you and this point year ed thinking machine of yours well you d better do something because im as anxious to get off this ruddy rock as you are\noh yes\ncaptain you sing and dance as well as anyone ive ever seen but what the devil are you talking about\nopportunity now listen spock you may be a wonderful science officer but believe me you couldnt sell fake patents to your mother\nforget it\ncaptain the kind of a whole some antiseptic galaxy that these androids would run would be purgatory for a man like me\nwhat can i do\nwhat do you mean oh now now wait a minute gentlemen no what ii had in mind was actually more in the line of a few words of sage counsel as it were advice\nbut you already have norman laddy human beings do not survive on bread alone you poor soulless creature but on the nourishment s of liberty for what indeed is a man without freedom naught but a mechanism trapped in the cog wheels of eternity\nbrilliant bravo bravo captain\ndont panic women and children first mister spock isnt that too much for our purposes\naye aye\ndetonator fuse primer mash ie\ni lied\nlisten to this carefully norman i am lying\nkirk old man im beginning to develop considerable respect for you\nwould you consider entering a partnership arrangement with me ive got some ideas\nyes\nive never heard of anything so revolting well soon get to the bottom of this\nkir know whats this i hear about my having to stay here\nbut what do i do kirk im no scientist\nhow long\ni suppose that taking everything into consideration as it were and noting all the different possibilities i could manage and as detention sentences go this one isnt too uncomfortable and im back in the galaxy again\ni call that unexpectedly civil of you captain\nshut up\ni order you shut up stella 1\nkirk you cant do this 2\nits inhuman 2\nno number five hundred nonono500\nkirk its inhuman mercy\ngood morning sir doctor\nit will not be necessary captain\ni am in total control of your ship i have connected the matter antimatter pods to the main navigational bank a trigger relay is now in operation any attempts to alter course will result in immediate destruction of this vessel\ni assure you we are no threat to humanity or humanoid life we mean you no harm but we require your ship\ni control the trigger relay siri can not be overcome by physical means and if you attempt to use your phasers the trigger relay will be activated we shall continue on our present course for approximately four solar days at which time we shall arrive at our destination\ni am not programmed to respond in that area\ncaptain kirk the following individuals will be transported down to our planet yourself science officer medical officer communications officer and navigator\nif you do not come with me your engines will be destroyed and you will remain in orbit here for ever\nthere is a word among us there is no corresponding meaning but it seems to mean something to you humans\nplease\nour planets surface is what you classify ask type adaptable for humans by use of pressure domes and life support systems i have brought them 1\nyes my lord mudd\nyou ll find this quite comfortable your quarters are down the hall1\nthe makers designed us they came from the galaxy of andromeda\nthey were as you say quite humanoid but unlike your civilisation robots were common we performed the necessary service functions and freed our makers to evolve a perfect social order\nour home planets sun became a nova only a few exploratory outposts survived this unit myself was part of one such outpost in your galaxy\nno captain they died over the stretch of time\nwe lack edit for a long time 1\ni trust you are enjoying yourself mister spock\nit is our central control complex\ntwo hundred and seven thousand eight hundred and nine\ni am not programmed to respond in this area\nyou may command us to make anything for you or do the work yourself for pleasure you may have the services of any number of craftsmen exclusive use of the computer facilities anything\nwe only wish to make you happy and comfortable captain if we are to serve your kind we must understand you our lord harry mudd was only one example for us now we are learning a great deal from all of you\nwe can no longer take your orders harry mudd\nour makers were wise they programmed us to serve\nyou are correct captain harry mudd is flawed even for a human being we recognised this from the beginning but used his knowledge to obtain more specimens your species is self destructive you need our help\nwe will not harm you but we will take the starship and you will remain on this planet\nwe can not allow any race as greedy and corruptible as yours to have free run of the galaxy\nwe shall serve them their kind will be eager to accept our service soon they will become completely dependent upon us 99\nwe shall take care of them\nyes captain and we shall serve them and you will be happy and controlled\nwhat are you doing here\nthat is illogical we can move more quickly than you we are in vulnerable to attack we are much stronger\nno\nthat is contradictory it is not logical mister spock explain\nyou can not have killed him you have no weapons\nthat is irrational illogical dreams are not real\nthere is no explosive\nbut there was no explosion\nwhat\nyou say you are lying but if everything you say is a lie then you are telling the truth but you can not tell the truth because everything you say is a lie you lie you tell the truth but you can not for illogical illogical please explain\nyou are human only humans can explain their behaviour please explain\nsecurity lieutenant rowe here sir\nacknowledged\ntake care of him\nsecurity to captain kirk\nlieutenant rowe siri min auxiliary control ensign jordans been knocked out\nthe directional master controls have been jammed theyre totally unworkable\nno sir hes gone ive put out a full security alert on all decks\nhere your e not allowed\ncaptain hes here\nlet go of me now what are you doing what kind of a woman\nharry mudd oh you bogus frat you youre the cause of all this are you\nayes i randi stayed until that female gargantua threw me into the transporter beams\nabsolutely fantastic hand worked to the finest tolerances microvision and a nano pulse laser ive never seen the like before\ncaptain you should see this shop why they have facilities weve never even thought of\nwhat did they offer you uhura\nwell captain androids and robots theyre just not capable of independent creative thought\nhow does it look\nfood and drink and happiness mean nothing to us we must be about our job\ndying and crying and lamenting over our burdens\nicann ago on im tired of happiness im tired of comfort and pleasure im ready kill me kill me\ngoodbye cruel universe\nexplosive\nsomething wrong\nperhaps your e making a rather hasty judgment mister norman has only been aboard seventy two hours\nspecifics doctor labels do not make arguments\ni see\ni find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic\nthats not at all surprising doctor hes probably terrified of your beads and rattles\ninteresting\nconfirmed captain hes taken out all the override controls if we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is we could extinguish ourselves\nand most sophisticated\nhe simply appears to have turned himself off captain and since we can not repair the damage he has done without destroying the ship\nfive hundred of the same model that seems rather redundant\nhe did not pay royalties\nthe guilty party has his choice death by electrocution death by gas death by phaser death by hanging\nyou went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship here logically you must have a compelling motive\nthen im unable to discern your problem\nwhom do you serve now\nwe are and we must direct our attack to the heart of the matter obviously this many androids can not operate independently there must be a central control system which guides the entire android population\nvery interesting very interesting this is a most unusual device\ndid i understand there are more than two hundred thousand of you\nthis would seem to be a simple relay centre are all of you controlled through this device\noh thats quite understandable 263\ncaptain ive just had a most fascinating meeting with norman and im convince dive discovered a very important inconsistency\nhe could successfully accomplish it captain ive questioned a number of the androids and theyre totally loyal to mudd perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can literally provide anything a human being could ask for in unlimited quantity\nunhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled 471\nfascinating\nim curious norman just how do you intend to stop them\neminently practical\nindeed it is not they may quite possibly be able to accomplish it\nwhatever method we use to stop them we must make haste they have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the enterprise and they ll be able to leave orbit\ni asked them\nyet the device that norman claims to be their central control is totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred thousand of them\nthere are a large number of alices and trudie s maisie s annabel sand according to my research a herman series an oscar series a whole plethora of series in fact but only one norman\nto function as they do each android mind must be one component of a mass brain linked through a central locus\nthat would seem logical\nwhat would seem to be a sound and perhaps our only opportunity\ni fail to understand why i should care to induce my mother to purchase falsified patents\nof course your computations would inevitably lead to a total description of the parabolic intersection of dimension with dimension 27\nthank you 210\ni love you however i hate you 210\nyes of course that is exactly why i hate you because you are identical\nfascinating\nsuccess captain we ve been pruning the leaves and branches of the tree now it is time to get to work on the root\naffirmative\nlogic is a little tweet ing bird chirping in a meadow logic is a wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad are you sure your circuits are registering correctly your ears are green\nvery well captain\ni believe that is the correct amount captain mister mudd are you ready\nbe careful i would not want you to drop it\ni believe they are all immobilised captain\nthat is a human emotion doctor with which i am totally unfamiliar how could i be unhappy\nwhich i find eminently satisfactory doctor for no whereami so desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans\nthe androids are being reprogrammed their original purpose was to adapt this planet for productive use theyll begin that work again\nharcourt harcourt fenton mudd what have you been up to nothing good im sure well let me tell you you lazy good for nothing\nnothing thing thing\nharcourt fenton mudd where have you been what have you been up to have you been drinking again you miserables ot you good for nothing\nthing thing thing\nharcourt harcourt fenton mudd what have you been up to have you been drinking again you answer me\nyou miserable conniving toad\nstaying out all night then giving me some silly story 2\nharcourt harcourt fenton mudd you ve been overeating again and drinking\nyou need constant supervision\ni can see ive got my work cut out for me500\nharcourt\nwhat have you been up to\nthere san unplanned course change being fed into the instruments sir\ni cant sir\nsir auxiliary control is on total override\nturning on three oh seven degrees mark eight being executed now sir\nsir the instruments wont respond\nsir were picking up speed warp five six warp seven sir\ni cant sir all the controls are jammed\naye sir\ni should say so\nhow long does a body like that last 19\nfive hundred thousand years 263\nand it is a very pleasant place captain\noh nothing really important just immortality\nno they relying its a trick doctor mccoy injected something into harry mudd to make him look sick its a trick to get back on board and sabotage the ship 1\nbecause i want an android body i want immortality ill live forever captain ill be young and beautiful 1\nthank you 1\ni half believed it myself scott well the androids were expecting an attempt and now weve made it\nthank you kinds ir2",

have\nmister cochrane you say you were brought here a hundred and fifty years ago you dont look over thirty five\nyou say you can communicate with it perhaps you can find out what were doing here\nyou wouldnt mind telling us\ni already dont like it\nyou mean you brought us here\nspock run additional tricorder readings learn anything you can find me a weapon to use against this thing\ni intend to do whatever s necessary to get us off this planet and commissioner hed ford to the hospital if the companion stands in the way then we push it out of the way clear spock\nvery well you have your orders mister cochrane if you left here what would happen to you\ndo you want to leave here\nwere on a thousand planets and spreading out we cross fantastic distances and everything s alive cochrane life everywhere we estimate there are millions of planets with intelligent life we have nt begun to map them interesting\nits all out there waiting for you but well need your help to get away\nyou seem to think this companion of yours can do almost anything\ncould it cure her\nhow do you communicate with it\nwe ve got to try were helpless see if it can do something\nhow do you do it\nbones what do you make of that\nexactly what i think not exactly like a pet owner speaking to a beloved animal would you say\nagreed more like love\nwell\nthen shell die\nit troubles you cochrane\nits also keeping you prisoner\nwere getting out of here cochrane face up to it ill do anything i have to to save all of our lives\nplease outside\nnori tours\nnow\nyeah\ncochrane got it off of us but i dont know whether he did usa favour or not\nhow do you fight a thing like that ive got a ship up there somewhere responsibility for four lives here one of them dying because of me\nim in command bones it makes it my fault how do you fight a thing like that\nspock\nthe universal translator on the shuttlecraft we can try that talk to that thing\nadjust it change it the trouble with immortality is its boring adjusting the translator will give you something to do\nright down your alley spock get it here and get to work that thing is still out there better go that way\nany change\nthere are certain universal ideas and concepts commontoall intelligent life this device instantaneously compares the frequency of brainwave patterns selects those ideas and concepts it recognises and then provides the necessary grammar\nwith a voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on the sending end not one hundred percent efficient but nothing ever is ready mister spock\nmister cochrane call the companion\ncompanion we wish to talk to you\nfeminine no doubt about it\nim way ahead of you\nno al over companion it is wrong to keep us here against our will\none of us will cease to exist if we dont get her to a place where we can care for her\ncompanion try to understand it is the nature of our species to be free just as it is your nature to stay here we will cease to exist in captivity\nthis isnt a classroom im trying to get us out of here\nthis isnt the time companion what you offer us is not continuation it is nonexistence we will cease to exist even the man will cease to exist\nwe didnt\nthe idea of male and female are universal constants cochrane theres no doubt about it the companion is female\nwhat are you complaining about it kept you alive\ncompanion do you love the man\nis he important to you more important than anything is he as though he were a part of you\nhe will not continue he will cease to exist by your feeling for him you are condemning him to an existence he will find unbearable he will cease to exist\nyou speak of his body is peak of his spirit companion inside the shelter a female of our species is dying she will not continue that is what will happen to the man unless you release all of us\nour species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome you take away all obstacles without them to strengthen us we will weaken and die you regard the man only as a toy you amuse yourself with him\nbut you cant really love him you havent the slightest knowledge of love the total union of two people you are the companion he is the man you are two different things you cant join you cant love you may keep him here for ever but you will always be separate apart from him\ntry to convince her of the hopelessness of it love sometimes expresses itself in sacrifice i thought maybe if she loved him shed let him go\ni tried\nbones\nwhat\nbones\nwe\nspock check out the shuttlecraft engine communications everything\ngo ahead cochrane we have a few things to do\nperfectly all right can you get a fix on us\nvery good ill continue transmitting assume standard orbit when you arrive well transport up in the shuttlecraft\ninteresting story

instruments they date from the time indicated from your ship mister cochrane\nyou ask me to find a weapon do you intend to destroy it\nquite clear captain\nyes quite all right doctor a most fascinating thing happened apparently the companion imparted to me a rather quaint old fashioned electric shock of respectable voltage\nevidently unquestionably a large part of its substance is simple electricity\nquite correct doctor\nput this in the proximity of the companion throw this switch and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce it can not fail\nwe may simply

emotional reaction is most illogical your relationship with the companion has for one hundred and fifty years been emotionally satisfying eminently practical and totally harmless it may indeed have been quite beneficial\nfascinating a totally parochial attitude\nbut she or it is in human captain you can not expect her to react like a human\ncompanion you do not have the power to create

ier than a raw antimatter pile over this cori dan question\nhow does that vulcan salute go\nthat hurts worse than the uniform\nambassador\nmister ambassador i understand you had retired before this conference was called for give my curiosity but as a doctor im interested in vulcan physiology isnt it unusual for a vulcan to retire at your age after all your e only a hundred and two\nspock ive always suspected that you were a little more human than you let on mrs sarek i know about the rigorous training of the vulcan youth but tell me did he ever run and play like the human children even in secret\nseh lat\na teddy bear\na teddy bear\nhis neck was broken by an expert\nwell from the nature and location of the break id say the killer knew exactly where to apply pressure to snap the neck instantly\ninteresting spock do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect\nhis neck was broken mister ambassador by what spock describes as tal shaya\nits difficult to say with vulcan physiology but i believe its something to do with his cardiovascular system\ni dont know that yet either\nas far as i can tell from instrument readings our primesuspect has a malfunction in one of the heart valve its similar to a heart attack in a human but with vulcan physiology its impossible to tell without an operation mrs sarek has he had any previous attacks\nim not sure its tough enough on a human on a vulcan an ordinary operations out of the question\nwell im glad somebodys asking me something around here well the procedure theyre discussing would require tremendous amounts of blood for the patient\nyes\nyes id say that sr are\neven you couldnt give that much blood spock it would kill you\nmrs sarek you must understand the chances are extremely small to find a way to produce sufficient t negative blood\ni see it spock but that was a rigelian\nsimilar is not good enough its still experimental\nspock we would need such great amounts of blood that even if the drug worked on the vulcans as well as a rigelian which im doubtful it would still drains are k to a critical level\nplus the factive never operated on a vulcan before oh ive studied the anatomical types i know where all the organs are but thats a lot different from actual surgical experience so if i dont kill him with the operation the drug probably will\na chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body its only experimental\nit places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver ins are ks condition the stimulant would kill him\nwhat has that got\nit could damage you internally it could kill you im sorry spock i cant sanction it\nits a bad wound punctured left lung a centimetre or so lower it d have gone through the heart\nspock your father is much worse theres no longer a choice i have to operate immediately we can begin as soon as your e prepared\nwhat\nyou can turn command over to scotty\nnow let that be a lesson to you just lie there and be happy your e still alive\nnot good if i could only operate\ni was when you became injured spock assumed command hes going to stay there until your e back on your feet even if it costs sarek his life regulations\njim if you stand you could start to bleed again\nive certified him physically fit mister spock now since i have an operation to perform and both of us are required\nreadings nurse\ni wish i knew whether that was good or bad initiate sterile field\nwhere do you think your e going\nmy patients dont walk out in the middle of an operation\nso is your fathers life\none more like that and im going to lose both these men\ncardio stimulate\nthen get me that old portable cardio stimulator\ncall engineering and have sickbay systems put on priority\nare you quite through shaking the ship around\ni dont mind telling you you sure make it difficult for a surgeon trying\nthat pig headed vulcan stamina i couldnt have pulled them through without it\norion\nif you keep arguing with your

a rite was murdered i was quite incapacitated\nnone\nbecause of the construction of the vulcan heart\nyes unquestionably\nmy blood type ist negative somewhat rare even for a vulcan\nmutual suspicion and interplanetary war\ni dont understand\nspock acted in the only logical manner open to him one does not thank logic amanda\nshe has always been that way\nat the time it seemed the logical thing to do\nwhy must you know tell a rite\nmy apologies captain\nhave you met gav before ambassador\nhe is the lev a minor member of my staff i know nothing of him except that he has served adequately\nmy people are a violent race but we veno quarrel with captain kirk\nyou suggest a plot how could it profit us to harm the captain\nperhaps you should forget logic and devote yourself to motivations of passion or gain those are reasons for murder\nvulcan honours us with your presence we come to serve\ncaptain ambassador sarek and his wife are my parents captains log stardate 38423 we have departed vulcan for the neutral planetoid codenamed babel since it is in our sector the enterprise has been assigned to transport ambassadors of federation planets to this vitally important council the issues of the council are politically complex the passengers explosive\nhumans smile with so little provocation\nthe situation between my father and myself has not changed\nyes captain\nif you will excuse me captain\nnot precisely doctor on vulcan the teddy bears are alive and they have six inch fangs\nsensors indicate the size of a scout ship but the configuration is unfamiliar most unusual\nstarfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except ours\nguess captain is hall need more data for my estimate\nvessel changing course heading toward us at high warp speed\ninteresting they were travelling at approximately warp ten\nvulcans on vulcan the method is called tal shaya it was considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times\nindeed captain interesting\nvulcans do not approve of violence\nno captain im merely saying it would be illogical to kill without reason\nif there were a reason my father is quite capable of killing logically and efficiently\nmother if only on circumstantial evidence he is a logical suspect\nyes captain i get sensor readings of tri tr itanium from the alien ships hull\nyes it could adversely affect our mission\nworry is a human emotion captain i accept what has happened the ships hull seems to have a high density level or is cloaked against sensor probes it is manned but sensors can not make out specifics\ni think it unlikely it is one of theirs\npossibly captain but i can not decode this transmission\nit is in no known code theres no detectable pattern no standard references apply\nonly negative it fits none of our computer records and it is alien\ndoctor do you propose surgery for the heart defect\ni suggest that a cryogenic open heart procedure would be the logical approach\nmy blood ist negative doctor\nit should be possible to filter out the human factors\nindeed i would estimate the odds\ndoctor\nrigelian physiology is very similar to vulcan\nbut it does look promising\ni consider the safety factor low but acceptable\nit has been used successfully on test subjects on rigel five\nmiss chapel i underwent a physical examination last week would you pull those records please\nit would seem the only answer\nthen you automatically condemns are k to death and you doctor have no logical alternative either if you do not operate sarek will die you now have the means to perform the operation i am volunteering myself as the blood donor ill be at my station until you require me the andorian pulls a knife and stabs kirk before getting kicked unconscious\nspock here\ncaptain captain captain captains log stardate 38434 first officer spock in temporary command the captain has been critically wounded by one of the delegates to the babel conference the ship is on alert status we are still being followed by the intruder vessel\nill be in the brig questioning the andorian prisoner\nno doctor\nmy first responsibility is to the ship our passengers safety is by starfleet order of first importance we are being followed by an alien possibly hostile vessel i can not relinquish command under these circumstances\non what grounds doctor command requirements do not recognise personal privilege ill be in the brig interrogating the andorian\nhe has been subjected to questioning under verifiers can and truth drug he reveals nothing i suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan\napparently the lev did\ni do not know there is no logic in the levs attack upon the captain there is no logic ing avs murder\ncome in\nmother when i was commissioned i took an oath to carry out responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified\nany competent officer can command this ship under normal circumstances the circumstances are not normal were carrying over one hundred valuable federation passengers were being pursued by an alien ship were subject to possible attack there has been murder and attempted murder on board i can not dismiss my duties\ni know but this must take precedence if i could give the transfusion without loss of time or efficiency i would sarek understands my reason\nmother how can you have lived on vulcan so long married a vulcan raised a son on vulcan without understanding what it means to be a vulcan\nit means to adopt a philosophy a way of life which is logical and beneficial we can not disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain no matter how important that gain might be\ncan you imagine what my father would say if i were to agree if i were to give up command of this vessel jeopardise hundreds of lives risk interplanetary war all for the life of one person\nmother\ni can not\ncaptain\ncaptain are you quite all right\ni must see the captain\nthe alien ship ive just realised that if their power utilisation curve is not the norm it should be possible to identify them this way very important\ncaptain i believe you ll find the alien\ni think you ll find he san orion doctor\nintelligence reports that orion smugglers have been raiding the cori dan system\nthe thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve it made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us that ship was constructed for a suicide mission since they never intended to return to their home base they could use one hundred percent power on their attacks the thing i dont understand is why i didnt think of it earlier\nthat hardly seems likely\nemotional isnt she\nindeed why did you marry her\ndoctor ill return to my station now\nindeed captain ive never seen him look so happy\nthat was intended from the beginning captain\nfind your own answers captain you havent long to live\nspeculation captain\nwhat are you doing\nyour e baiting him your e trying to lure him in\nthey could not surrender captain they had orders to self destruct\nonly temporarily captain you see i had orders to self destruct too slow poison quite painless actually but theres no known antidote i anticipate another ten minutes of life\ni seem to have miscalculated\nbridge to captain kirk\ncaptain ive picked up some sort of signal just a few symbols nothing intelligible\nthats what bothers me sir impossible to locate there was nt enough of it sensors show nothing in the area but it was a strong signal as though it was very close\nive tried all frequencies and hooked in the universal translator no response sir kirk maintain translator broadcast check records for authorised ships\ncaptain starfleet acknowledges report on our situation and confirms no authorised federation vessel in this quadrant\ncaptain i picked up the last part of a transmission just like that other one i put the recorder and the directional locator on it immediately\nsir the direction allocator indicates reception point somewhere within the body of this ship\nyes sir\nnone sir\ncaptain im picking up the alien signal again but its coming from inside the enterprise\nfrom the brig sir\ncaptain the intercoms are jammed all the ambassadors

the annual check of every scientific expedition is routine\nquite impossible doctor iran a personnel check on this expedition before we beamed down i assure you that none of them were theyve come to pay their respects to alvin\nsensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life the atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays\ni have already begun investigation into that possibility captain\nive rechecked the sensors captain gamma hydra four checks out as a class m planet with a conventional oxygen nitrogen atmosphere and normal mass i can find nothing at all out of the ordinary\nwere checking it on itive reached no conclusions as yet the comet was a rogue and has never been investigated\nall research lines negative captain\nim doing that captain as per your previous order we discussed that earlier\nacknowledged\nbased on what doctor mccoy gave me i estimate that physically we each have less than a week to live also since our mental faculties are aging faster than our bodies we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably lesser time\nyes captain in a very short time\ni must differ with you doctor im having difficulty concentrating which is most disturbing my eyesight appears to be failing and the normal temperature of the ship seems to me to be increasingly cold\ncaptain you sent such a message this morning\ncaptain i believe captain captain\nyes sir quite understandable\nyes sir we have the cause of the affliction\nthe orbit of gamma hydra four carried the planet directly through the comets trail on conventional radiation settings we discovered nothing on resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range of the scale undetected radiation appeared below normal radiation levels but definitely present and undoubtedly residue from the comet\nquadrant fourfour eight sir\nmister sulu what is our present position\npossibly doctor because my thinking processes are not as efficient as before\ni have a question for the doctor doctor the ships temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me ive adjusted the environment in my quarters to one hundred twenty five degrees which is at least tolerable however i\ni wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my sensitivity to cold\nyes asi always suspected\ncommodore\ni am aware of that\nfor what sir\non what grounds commodore\nneed i remind you sir that i too have contracted the same affliction\nim half human sir my physical reflexes are down my mental capacity is reduced i tire easily no siri am not fit for command\nsiri do have duties to perform\ni resist that suggestion commodore\nvery well sir the hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred hours\nlet it read that this competency hearing was ordered by commodore stocker and reluctantly called by myself\non the contrary commodore as presiding officer and as second in command of the enterprise the responsibility is mine captain kirk would you like to make a statement\nit is quite impossible captain the regulations are quite specific you are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses immediately after the board has questioned them\nmister sulu how long have you served with captain kirk\nto your knowledge has he ever had any difficulty making decisions\ndid he order you to maintain standard orbit around gamma hydra four\ndid he not several minutes later repeat that order\ndid he order you to increase orbit\ndid he not several minutes later repeat that order\nmister sulu please answer the question\nthank you mister sulu yeoman atkins you handed captain kirk a fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses which he read and signed is that correct\nyeoman you will simply answer the question\nyou guess\nthank you yeoman you may leave lieutenant uhura i have here a bulletin from starfleet command which states that the romulans have broken code two are these your initials which appear at the bottom\nand whose initials are those which appear directly below yours\ndid captain kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which passed gamma hydra four\nusing code two\nafter you reminded him that the romulans had broken code two\nthank you lieutenant doctor mccoy doctor mccoy\nseveral hours ago at the request of this board you ran a complete physical examination of captain kirk\nmedical banks compute described subjects physical age using established norms as comparative base\ndoctor mccoy\nwill you give us your professional evaluation of captain kirks present physical condition\nis not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly\ndoctor you heard the computers analysis of captain kirks physical age do you agree with it\ndo you agree with it doctor\nthis board has no further questions unless you commodore stocker have something that you would like to add\ndo you wish to call any witnesses captain kirk\ncaptain i would suggest\ngamma hydra four captain\nyour e inability to remember having given commands reading and signing important orders and then for getting them your physical analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon all these things would appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental conditions\nwe have no more questions captain\nthere ll be no more questions captain if you would leave the room so the board can vote\nsir you have never commanded a

was unfit for command commodore stocker is ranking officer\ni can not captain\nno sir only commodore stocker can give a command order on board this ship\nit would seem to be the place where i can be of the most use\nno not all the time captain he left us for a few moments\nyes yes indeed captain doctor you remember\nquite possible doctor perhaps a sufficiently efficacious compound could be developed\ndoctor i made the necessary computations and produced this serum it is crude and dangerous but we have no time for refinements\nit could cure or kill doctor\ndoctor wallace give him the shot\nromulans giving ground captain obviously they tapped in as you expected them to\nyes sir\nthe romulans were caught off guard captain theyre falling behind\ni am quite ready now doctor\nthat is very considerate of you doctor\ni appreciate that sir\nim sure you understand that im anxious to get to starbase ten to assume my new post\nthank you sir\ncaptain kirk\nfacilities at starbase ten are much more complete than those on board ship it seems to me that your investigations would be facilitated if we proceeded there i assure you all cooperation\nid hoped for a few words with you at your convenience\nif i may say so sir we have a due date at starbase ten\ncaptain im watching four very valuable and one almost irreplaceable members of the starfleet failing before my eyes i want to do something to help\nspock can i have a word with you\nmister spock a starship can function with a chief engineer a chief medical officer even a first officer under physical par but its disastrous to have a commanding officer whose condition is any less than perfection\nplease understand me my admiration for captain kirk is unbounded he is a great officer but mister spock i need your help and your cooperation\ni would like you to take over command of the enterprise\non the grounds that the captain because of his affliction is unable to perform his duties\nyes but your e a vulcan you have a much greater lifespan you show the affects to a much smaller degree\nwell if you are not with your vulcan physique then obviously captain kirk can not be\nmister spock i do not like what im about to say but regulations demand it and as a starfleet flag officer i must follow regulations as second in command of the enterprise you must convene an extraordinary competency hearing\nits not a matter of choice when a captain is unfit physically or mentally a competency hearing is mandatory please dont make me quote a regulation which you know as well as i do\nmister spock may i make a statement i have had to resort to these legal grounds in order to save the lives of some very valuable members of the starfleet i have tried to convince captain kirk of the necessity of proceeding to starbase ten but ive been overruled in each case the responsibility of this hearing is mine\nthe computer differs with you captain\nno i am quite satisfied mister spock\nwell since the senior officers are incapable and iam of flag rank i am forced by regulations to assume command\nwhat would you have a junior officer with far less experience than i have\nmister spock we have to save these people mister sulu set a direct course for starbase ten warp five\nimmediately mister sulu all officers are to return to their posts\nthank you mister sulu lieutenant uhura let me know if we contact any romulan\nkeep trying to raise the romulans\nif i could talk to them explain to them why we violated the neutral zone\nopinion mister sulu\nwell then we have no alternative but to surrender\nwhat ami going to do ive got to do something\ncaptain i just wanted to assure you that i did what i thought best to save you and the men\nif i may say so captain i am now quite aware of what a starship can do with the right man at the helm\nstandard orbit captain\nyou already gave that command sir\nyoull live\nmaintaining standard orbit captain\naye aye sir\nyou mean another twenty thousand

admired a great man\nno just you\na few years ago on aldebaran three my husband and i tried various carbohydrate compounds to slow down the degeneration of plant life\nyes sir\nwe both go in the same direction\nlook we know the problem we know the progress of the affliction therefore once we find the proper line of research its only logical we find the solution\nno problem is insoluble not even ours\nour situation doesnt have its roots in logic the heart is not a logical organ when i married theodore wallace i thought i was over you i was wrong\nwhat\nwhat difference does that make\ntwenty

and i think i know something else now\nkirk here\nopen the vent on my way to the bridge kirk out ensign garro vick\nyou were on the bridge when we were attacked\nvery commendable ensign what was your

saying what he thought you wanted to hear\ni intend to find out ill be in the medical record library\nensign did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud\ndid you get any subconscious impressions that this was a creature a living thinking thing rather than just a strange cloud of chemical elements\nyou were a little hard on the boy jim\ninterrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance mister spock its a relief\nthen i need a drink\nyou need advice from me you must be kidding\njim and his creature\nno with all these deaths and injuries ive only had a chance to scan the tapes there are eight or ten hours of record tape there\nthe same as our ensign\nmind if i come in\nsometimes they do if were lucky monsters come in many forms you know the greatest monster of them all jim guilt\njim when a young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the first time he s under tremendous emotional stress now we all know that\nam ii was speaking of lieutenant james t kirk of the starship farragut eleven years ago you were the young officer at the phaser station when something attacked according to the tapes this young lieutenant kirk insisted upon blaming himself\nyou had a normal emotion you were startled you delayed firing for a grand total of perhaps two seconds\nthe ships exec didnt seem to think so his log entry was quite clear on the subject lieutenant kirk is a fine young officer who performed with uncommon bravery\ncaptain garro vick was very important to you wasn the jim\nyou dont know that jim you dont know that any more than you know that garro vick could have destroyed it\nto be so obsessed\nthat you could destroy yourself your career a young boy who reminds you of yourself eleven years ago\nim not jim this is professional captain i am preparing a medical log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional condition of a starship captain which requires a witness of command grade\nthey need those vaccines on theta seven captain now why are we delaying here\nyou state that it happened just as you lost consciousness a semi conscious mind is a very tricky thing a man never knows how much is real or how much is imagination\nyes theres no doubt about that\njim were not trying to gang upon you\nat this point my medical log remains open\nwhats that\na survey on cygni an respiratory diseases i thought you took garro vick some food what were you doing with this\none man has a chance for survival the other is dead you can add that little price tag to your monster hunt\nits not enough you didnt care as long as you could hang your trophy on the wall well its not on it captain its init\ncreature mister spock\nim sorry jimi was wrong\njim spock may be dying\nits that green blood of his\nill be the left a bad taste in the creatures mouth too\ni assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it\nits the time factor that bothers me those drugs are perishable\ni presume you intend to use that ha emo plasm to attract the creature\ndo something\ncrazy way to travel spreading a mans molecules all over the universe\nwell then thank pitchforks and pointed ears as long as it worked jim\nyes sir\nseemed to read dik iron ium for a minute and then i lost it its almost like something out there know sim scanning it it kind of keeps changing itself into something different that isnt possible nothing can do that\ncaptain\ncaptain\ntheres a strange cloud sir\ncloud cloud\nhelp me help\nremember im cold im so cold\nyes yes a smell a strange smell it was like being smothered in honey\nit was trying to draw strength from us i felt it it was it was it was there\nacknowledged captain theyll send one fast enough for this richa find\nready to beam back aboard captain\nthe yorktown is expecting to rendezvous with us in less than eight hours captain that doesnt give us much time\ncutting in ifi may captain the yorktown is expecting to rendezvous with us in less than seven hours\ncaptain while were waiting ive taken the liberty of cleaning the radioactive disposal venton number two impulse engine but well be ready to leave orbit in under half an hour\nthe medicine for theta seven colony is not only needed desperately and has limited\nagreed sir\ncaptain we cant maintain warp eight speed much longer pressures are approaching the critical point\naye sir\ncaptain we cant do it if we keep

four times as hard to be exact\nwe wont be able to break it captain ill phaser off a specimen\nwere in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet there are doubtless many pollen aromas\ncaptain dik iron ium exists only in laboratory experiments\nrizzo s alive barely\nyou think you know what it was captain\nspock here ready to leave orbit captain\nspock again captain those medical supplies are badly needed on planet theta seven they are expecting us to get them there on time\ncontinuing scanning still no readings of life forms on the planet\nyou mentioned dik iron ium captain\nive scanned for that element captain theres no trace of dik iron ium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere\nto hide from a sensors can it would have to be able to change its molecular structure like gold changing itself to lead or wood changing itself to ivory\nchekov takeover on scanner\nwhat was the size of the thing you saw ensign\ncomposition\ncaptain scientifically\ni hope im not disturbing you doctor\ni need your advice\ni do not understand your reasoning\ni do not joke doctor perhaps i should rephrase my statement i require an opinion there are many aspects of human irrationality i do not yet comprehend obsession for one the persistent single minded fixation on one idea\nprecisely have you studied the incident involving the farragut\nfortunately i read somewhat faster in brief doctor nearly half the crew and the captain were annihilated the captains name was garro vick\nhis father among the survivors was a young officer on his first deep space assignment james t kirk and there is still more i suggest you study this\ncorrectly phrased captain as recommended in the manual our reply also as recommended is sir we have noted in your recent behaviour certain items which on the surface seem unusual we respectfully ask permission to inquire further\nsir the yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point it carries perishable drugs\ncreature captain\nyou say you could sense its intelligence captain how did it communicate with you\nobviously captain if it is an intelligent creature if it is the same one if it therefore is capable of space travel it could pose a great threat to inhabited planets\nwe are barely closing in on it captain we could be pursuing it for days\nconflicting data captain it seems to be in a borderline state between matter and energy elements of both it could possibly use gravitational fields for propulsion\nextremely efficient captain whether that indicates intelligence is another matter\nthe deflectors will not stop it captain\ni should have surmised this for the creature to be able to use gravity as a propulsive force it would have to have this capacity\nmay i suggest that we no longer be labour the question of whether or not we should have gone after the creature the matter has now been rendered academic the creature is now after us\nit turned and attacked doctor its method was well considered and intelligent\nimpossible to tell captain until i can make a closer survey of the creature\ncaptain the creatures ability to throw itself out of time sync makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser hits there is therefore no basis for yourself recrimination if you had fired on time and on target eleven years ago it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago captain garro vick would still be dead the fault was not yours jim in fact there was no fault\nensign ami correct in my assumption that you ve been disturbed by what you consider to be a failure on your part i would like you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself is an hereditary trait of your species when suddenly faced by the unknown or imminent danger the human will experience a split second of indecision he hesitates do i have your attention ensign\ni know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than\nkindness mr garro vick is another human emotion and i believe we have enough of that is imply would like you to accept the fact that your reaction has its basis in physio do you smell something\nget out of here ill attempt to seal it off\nfortunately neither of us is dead ensign the reverse pressure worked the vent is closed\nmy haemoglobin is based on copper not iron\ncolloquially expressed but essentially correct\ndo you believe you re in communication with the creature\nit was bearing one two seven mark nine but ive lost it now\nit has changed course before to mislead us captain logic would dictate that\ni do not understand captain\nand you know where home is captain\nprecisely\ndoctor evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn if so it will reproduce by fission not just into two parts but thousands\nan ounce should be sufficient we can drain it from the ships engines and transport it to the planet surface in a magnetic vacuum field\nthere is still one problem captain\nexactly a matter antimatter blast will rip away half the planets atmosphere if our vessel is in orbit and encounters those shock waves\nalso we can not be certain the transporter will operate under those conditions if a man is beaming up when that hits we may lose him\ncaptain there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood the creature could not harm me extensively it therefore seems logical for me to be the one\nit will require two men to transport the antimatter unit\nspock here captain\nacknowledged\nspock here captain holding at thirty thousand kilometres\nspock here\nreset energise\nwe are doctor cross circuiting to

computer which will in turn notify us doctor mccoy has already fed the computer his medical reports our laboratory experts are examining the murder weapon and will give their data to the computers for analysis shall we begin\nmister scott will you take the stand\ncomputer identify verification\nsubjects present physical condition\nsufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional

scott did you kill kara\ndid you kill lieutenant tracy\ncomputer accuracy scan\nafter we take the testimony here well run a psycho tricorder analysis of mister scotts memory which is what we wanted to do on the surface that will give us a complete record will that satisfy you mister hengist\nthere will be no error as for the rest of it the readings will show you can step down mister scott if there are no objections\nwe can ask no more mis term or la will you take the stand\nwhere were you at the time that kara was murdered\ndid you kill lieutenant tracy\ndid you kills y bo\ncomputer verifications can\nall right mis term or la i think you can step down now sy bo spoke of a hunger that never dies something that thrives on fear terror death mister spock may be were going about it in the wrong way lets assume that sy bow as a sensitive that she did sense something something evil\nall right then what was its he said exactly a monstrous evil ancient terror\nshe said something else words that didnt make sense\nobscure meaningless words\nah mister spock check them out\njack the ripper\nyes all men die and jack the ripper couldnt be alive if he were a man but everything weve uncovered points to jack the ripper which is an impossibility isnt it or is it\nwe know that someone or something killed three women if its impossible for it to be human it has to be something else something driven to kill\nno mister hengist not ghosts possibly not human but not ghosts mister spock check out the possibilities\ncomputer could the described entity assume physical form\nno ive seen the mellitus myself in its natural state its gaseous when its at rest its solid mister spock lets assume the existence of this creature\ndoesnt seem likely does it\nall right mister spock what do we have a creature without form that feeds on horror and fear that must assume a physical shape to kill\ncomputer criminological files cases of unsolved mass murders of women since jack the ripper\nyes when man moved out into the galaxy that thing must ve moved with him computer identify the proper names kes la and berat is\nyou come from rigel four\nno but what were investigating is would you mind taking the stand mister hengist\nand you were unaccounted for when lieutenant tracy was murdered\nperhaps mister spock the murder weapon\nnow then mister hengist\nbut thats impossible\nand the computer controls the ship\naudio cut off spock\nit means that thing can control the entire operation of the ship including the life support systems\nall hands this is the captain stay at your posts remain calm captain out bones whats the sedative situation\ngood start distribution immediately the longer we can hold back that fear the more time well have to get that thing out of the computer prefect youll all be safer here spock come with me\nspock dont you have a compulsory scan unit built into the computer banks\narent there certain mathematical problems which simply can not be solved\nthat ought to do it\nspock\ntoo quickly bridge\nout of control put it on manual bridge\nthat was due to be next life support malfunction\nyou said it yourself spock it wants terror not just

briefing room\ni doubt very much whether the computers will be inhabited by more than a group of figures for awhile\nhow are you doing\nyes but where to bones what would happen if that thing entered a tranquilli sed body\nyou say everyones had a shot but you and jar is\nwell im willing to take a chance on mister spock better give yourself a shot doc\ndo as i say\nextend your arm mister jar is\nlets

me mister spock id have gotten round to it\nthats an understatement if i ever heard one this is a completely hedonistic society\nmy work jim this is prescription stuff dont forget the explosion that threw scotty against a bulkhead was caused by a woman\noh yes yes as a matter of fact considerable psychological damage could have been caused for example his total resentment toward women\nof course in my professional opinion when he gets back to the ship hes going to hate you for making him leave arg eli us but then he will have lost total resentment toward women\noh yes i know the place lets go\nshes dead jim\nyour e not a native of arg eli us sir\njim if he says he cant remember he probably doesnt you know scotty\nyou dont think by any chance that scotty\nbut you dont just throw him to the wolves\nbut he s suffering from a severe concussion\nthe arg elian empathic contact\nprefect it will give us a detailed account of everything thats happened to mister scott in the last twenty four hours\nprefect the psycho tricorder will require privacy to be effective\ncaptain under normal conditions scotty would have never done such a thing\nof course there s another possibility\nhysterical amnesia when a man feels guilty about something something too terrible to remember he blots it out of his conscious memory\nshes dead jim just like the other one\ngo ahead scotty\nis that all that happened\nit could be jim that head injury\nlocks can be picked jim\nsorry jim the lock mayor may not have been picked it would be hard to tell even with the tricorder\ni dont care what the

can be\nthat devours all life and light\nyes redjacberatisanderkesla\nsy bo said it feeds on death\nyes but she said more than that not just death but fear she said it also feeds on fear\nextremely possible there are many such examples that exist in nature\njust after you left jar is house we discovered the murder knife was missing\nhes dead jim\nscotty give me a hand\nive got some stuff that would tranquilli sean active volcano\nif you drive it out of the computer sitll have to go somewhere else\nim almost finished just jar is and me\nwell it might take up knitting but nothing more violent than that\nand you and mister spock captain\nno i dont think so i think i ought to stay clear\nyou d better be careful your e going to hurt somebody with that thing\nwell jar isis all right\nthat thing cant die\ni dont know five or six hours i gave them a pretty big shot jim\ni know the place jim\nplease i know nothing about it i didnt kill anyone\nmor la of cantab a street prefect i was there i have nothing to hide\ni know it was wrong but i just couldnt help myself i loved her and when she went over to the table with these men i could not stand to watch so i left and went home\nprefect i didnt kill anyone i couldnt\nbut that doesnt mean anything captain with a room that small the lights were out anyone would ve had time to kill the lady\nim not sure walking home i assume i was angry\nive never done violence in my life i dont think i could you ve got to believe me i wouldnt kill her i couldnt i loved her and she loved me\nno\nno\nyou mean it could kill us all\nyes sir\nyes sir\ncaptain i think im going to like arg eli us\nyou mean to tell me all these women that all this is\naye why should nti\nnow thats what i call a real captain always thinking of his men\nnow no one has to tell an old aberdeen pubcrawler how to applaud captain\nt is a fine foggy night tonight and i doubt if anyone s ever told you of the marvellous fogs we have in aberdeen\nwell then why dont is how you theres nothing like a walk in the fog with a bonny lass\nyou dont mind do you i might even get back to the ship on time\nii dont remember\nwe were walking in the fog i was up ahead trying to lead the way i heard the girls cream i remember starting to turn i dont remember another thing\ni certainly hope so sir i cant stand this not knowing\nlieutenant captain wheres\ndead but i\ni was sitting there she was taking her readings and now im sitting here\ni tell you i dont remember i must have passed out\ncaptain ive been trying i cant even believe this

did not kill your wife or the other ladies\naye\naye i understand captains log stardate 36154 with mister scott in a technical state of arrest we have beamed aboard the enterprise to continue the

circle was broken i heard the poor lady scream and as i was near the head of the table anyway i went toward her but there was something in my way\nno captain something cold it was like a stinking

go see\nenterprise spock here\nacknowledged coordinates received\nspock here captain may i have a word with you\nconcerning the situation you related to us in my opinion the arg elian empathic contact

breeding animals is not against regulations only breeding dangerous ones and tribbles are not dangerous\nprecisely and at six credits ahead well that is a body it mounts up now if you ll excuse me\nif i did what would happen to mans search for knowledge well i must be tending my ship au revoir\nreally captain kirk i must protest this treatment\nthey do i cant understand it the last time i saw one act this way was at the bar\nklingons him for one\nwell captain i suppose im free to go now\ncaptain one little tribble isnt harmful captain you wouldnt do a thing like that to me now would you would you\ncaptain kirk friend friend kirk surely we can come to some sort of mutual understanding after all my tribbles did put you wise to the poisoned grain and they did help you to find the klingon agent you saved a lot of lives that way\nyes\nit would take years\nseventeen point nine years\ncaptain your e a hardman all right all right\nill do it\ngood mister chekov this flight is supposed to

way\nanother technical journal scotty\ndont you ever relax\nyou running a nursery lieutenant\ndid you get this at the space station\nkirk here\npipe it down here will you mister chekov\nyes mister bar is what can i do for you\ni was not aware mister bar is that twelve klingons constitutes a swarm\nmister baris i have guards around the grain i have guards around the klingons the only reason those guards are there is because starfleet wants them there as for what you want it has been noted and logged kirk out\nsickbay with a headache\nbones what have you got for a headache\nboth how many of these did uhura give you\nbut you ve got er eleven\nhow do they how do they\na fat tribble\nwell bones all i can suggest is you open up a maternity ward\nall you men going on shore leave to stay in groups avoid trouble with the klingons\narent you going on shore leave scotty\ni want you to go on shore leave make sure that everybody stays out of trouble\nscotty enjoy yourself\ni want to know who started it im waiting free man who started the fight\nall right chekov i know you you started it didnt you\nwho did\ni dont know siri want to know who threw the first punch all right your e all confined to quarters until i find out who started it dismissed scotty not you you were supposed to prevent trouble mister scott\nwho threw the first punch scotty\nmister scott\nyou did mister scott what caused it scotty\nmust have been some insult\nyou threw the first punch\nyou held why did chekov want to start a fight\nno this is not off the record\nis that all\ni see\ni get the picture scotty\nafter they said all this thats when you hit the klingons\nno\noh yes\nwhat was it they said that started the fight\ni see and thats when you hit the klingons\nyou hit the klingons because they insulted the enterprise not because they\nall right scotty dismissed scotty your e restricted to quarters until further notice\ndoctor mccoy would you mind coming up to the bridge lieutenant uhura how did all these tribbles get on the bridge\ndoctor mccoy\nexplain that\ni know but really\ntoo much of anything lieutenant even love isnt necessarily a good thing\nget the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship and then contact mister l urry and tell him im beaming down\nhave him find cyrano jones and hold him\nand get these tribbles off the bridge\noh really\njust incredibly prolific\nyou should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this thing\non the contrary sir i think of this project as very important it is you i take lightly\nthats a serious charge to whom are you referring\ncyrano jones a klingon agent\ni heard you\nwhat evidence do you have against mister jones\nyes yes go on what else do you have\ndo you have any proof of that\npeople have disrupted stations before without being klingon agents sometimes all they need is a title mister bar is unfortunately disrupting a space station is not an offence now if you ll excuse me i have a ship to tend to au revoir\nmy chicken sandwich and coffee this is my chicken sandwich and coffee\ni want these off the ship i dont care if it takes every man we ve got i want them off the ship\nhow\nand in the storage

tells me\nyes bones i want the tribbles the grain everything analysed i want to know what killed these tribbles\nuntil that inquiry im still the captain and as captain i want two things done first find cyrano jones and second close that door\nah mister jones with an armful a few questions\nwhat do you want\nan apology\nwell well see about that but before i take any official action id like to know just what happened who put the tribbles in the quadro triticale what was in the grain that killed them\nyes\nhold on a minute i thought you said tribbles liked everybody\nwhat was in the bar\nyour e right mister jones they dont like klingons but they do like vulcans i didnt know you had it in you\nobviously mister bar is they like you well theres no accounting for taste they dont like you mister darvin i wonder why bones\ni wonder what starfleet command will say about that what about the grain bones\nthey starved to death in a storage compartment full of grain they starved to death\nmister darvin are you going to talk\nand the tribbles had nothing to do with it\ncaptain kolo th about that apology\nyou have six hours to get your ship out of federation territory\nyou know i think i could learn to like tribbles\nno your e not theres something i want to show you you know what the penalty is for transporting an animal proven harmful to human life\nthere is one thing you can do\npick up every tribble on the space station if you do that ill speak to mister l urry about returning your spaceship\nconsider it job security\nyoull do it\ngood that means shermans planet will get its quadro triticale only a few weeks late i dont see any tribbles around here\nbones how did you do it\nscotty where are the tribbles\nof course spock\ngentlemen i dont want to interrupt this mutual admiration society but id like to know where the tribbles are\nmister scott where are the tribbles\nyou used the transporter\nwhere did you transport them scott you didnt transport them into space did you\nwhere are they\nwhere\nyou gave them to the klingons\nfrankly i never liked earthers they remind me of regula n bloodworms\nah my dear captain kirk\nlet me assure you that my intentions are peaceful as ive already told mister l urry the purpose of my presence is to invoke shore leave rights\ncaptain we klingons are not as luxury minded as you earthers we do not equip our ships with how shall i say it non essentials\ni might also add that under terms of the organi an peace treaty you can not refuse us\ncaptain kirk theres been no formal declaration of hostilities between our two respective governments so naturally our relationship will be a peaceful one\nof course\ncaptain kirk\nan official apology addressed to the klingon high command i expect you to assume full responsibility for the persecution of klingon nationals in this quadrant\nyes youve harassed my men youve treated them like criminals you ve been most un courteous captain kirk if you wish to avoid a diplomatic incident\nmister spock as far as shermans planet is concerned captain kirk has already given it to us\ncaptain kirk before you go on mayi make a request\ncan you get those things out of here\nyes\nwe have been in space for five months what we choose as recreation is our own business\nget it away from me\nget out of herewith that parasite\ntake it away\nthe earthers like those fuzzy things dont they\nnoi just remembered there is one earth man who doesnt remind me of a regula n bloodworm thats kirk are gul an bloodworm is soft and shapeless but kirk isnt soft kirk may be a swaggering overbearing tin plated dictator with delusions of godhood but he s not soft\nthats right and if i think that kirk is a deneb ian slime devil well thats my opinion too\nof course id say that captain kirk deserves his ship we like the enterprise we we really do that sagging old rust bucket is designed like a garbage scow half the quadrant knows it thats why they re learning to speak klingon ese\nyour e right i should i didnt mean to say that the enterprise should be hauling garbage i meant to say that it should be hauled away as garbage captains log stardate 45256 a small disturbance between the klingon crew and members of the enterprise crew has broken out aboard space station k7iam forced to cancel shore leave for both ships\nthis is mister lurrymanagerofk7i must apologise for the distress call\nwell perhaps you better beam over ill try to explain\ncaptain kirk this is nil zbar ishes out from earth to take charge of the development project on shermans planet\nmister spock\nquadro triticale is the only earth grain that grows on shermans planet we have several tons of it here on the station its very important that grain gets to shermans planet safely mister bar is thinks that klingon agents may try to sabotage it\ncaptain couldnt you at least post a couple of guards we do have a large number of ships passing through\ni dont think the klingons are planning to attack us\nbecause at this moment the captain of the klingon ship is sitting right here in my office\ncaptain may i speak to you a minute look i dont want them here but i dont have the authority to refuse\nwhats wrong\nhow long have you had that thing lieutenant\nwell in that case you got a bargain\nlieutenant do you mind if i take one of these down to the lab to see what makes it tick\ni wont harm a hair on its head wherever that is\nhi jim\nlet me guess klingons bar is\njust one\nyou noticed that huh here this ought to take care of it\ni havent figured that out yet but i can tell you this much almost fifty percent of the creatures metabolism is geared for reproduction do you know what you get if you feed at ribble too much\nno you get a bunch of hungry little tribbles\nwhats the matter spock\ndont tell me you ve got a feeling\ndoes everything have to have a practical use for you theyre nice soft and furry and they make a pleasant sound\nits a human characteristic to love little animals especially if they re attractive in some way\nspock i dont know too much about these little tribbles yet but there s one thing that i have discovered\ni like them better than i like you\nyes\nwhats that\nyes did you want to see me jim dont look at me its the tribbles who are breeding if we dont get them off this ship were going to be hip deep in them\nthe nearest thing i can figure out is they reborn pregnant which seems to be quite a timesaver\nand from my observations it seems theyre bisexual reproducing at will and brother have they got a lot of will\njimi think ive got it all we have to do is quit feeding them we quit feeding them they stop breeding\na lot of them are dead a lot of them are alive but they wont be for long\ni havent figured out what keeps them alive yet all right if i find out anything ill let you know\nheartbeat is all wrong his body temperature is jim this man is a klingon\noh yes it was poisoned\nyes its been impregnated with a virus the virus turns into an inert material in the bloodstream the more the organism eats the more inert matter is built up so after two or three days they reached a point where they couldnt take in enough nourishment to survive\nthat is essentially it\nand you wont find a tribble on this entire ship\ni can not take credit for another mans work scotty did it\ntell him spock\naye\ni am relaxing\nill tell them before they go sir\nwhy no sir\nbut captain aye sir\nuh no thanks\nwhen are you going to get off that milk diet lad\nwhere i come from thats soda pop this is a drink for a man\naye\neasy lad you ought to be more forgiving\ntake it easy lad everybodys entitled to an opinion\ndont do it mister and that san order\nforget it its not worth fighting for were big

back\nwell the klingons iris this off the record\nwell captain the klingons called you u hat in plated overbearing swaggering dictator with delusions of godhood\nno sir they also compared you with a deneb ian slime devil\nand then they said you\nyes sir\nno sir\nno i didnt you told us to avoid trouble\nand i didnt see that it was worth fighting about after all were big enough to take a few insults arent we\nthey called the enterprise a garbage scow sir\nyes sir\nwell sir this was a matter of pride\nyes sir thank you sir that ll give me a chance to catch upon my technical journals\ntheyre into the machinery all right and theyre probably in all the other food processors too\nprobably through one of the air vents\no her captain it was really mister spock s recommendation\ni used the transporter captain\naye\ncaptain kirk that dbe in human\ni gave them a good home sir\ni gave them to the klingons sir\naye sir before they went into warp i transported the

myx\nbrooding captain\ncaptain im neither brooding nor sombre but i do have reservations about your solution to the problem of the io tians\nhighly irregular to say the least captain im also curious as to how you propose to explain to starfleet command that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut\ncaptain if the io tians who are very bright and imitative people should take that

all i see here is you and a couple of your boys i dont see no federation\nwhat a couple of boys\nhe was talking about a percentage\nlook you figure may be forty percents enough\ncaptain i have received vocal contact from an official station they relayed us to a man named ox myx his title is boss\nlieutenant uhura here mister spock\nmister spock what are you doing on this frequency\nmister spock mistero x myx is making contact from the surface\nthat was the jail breakers with their latest recording on request time brought to you by bang bang the makers of the sweetest little automatic

did he sent it back with postage due\nlisten we pay our percentages were entitled to a little service for our money\nhold it okay pally were going for a ride\nlisten pally this could either be a taxi

their feet\nyeah we can handle it jim\nmccoy here\nworse theyre backed up into the corridor\non my way mccoy out\na stimulant\ntwo thirds of the personnel are affected\nno you know youll get everything i can tell you but when there is nothing what should i say\nnurse\ni have one i recommend survival lets get out of here\nsickbay to captain kirk\njim according to the life indicators the energy levels\naccording to the life monitors were dying\nwere all dying captains log stardate 43088 it is now ten minutes since we entered the zone of darkness we have stopped engines while we seek a defence against the energy drain which seems to pervade the zone\nstimulants i dont know how long we can keep this up\nbut at a dangerously low level well were still alive i suppose that s something\nall i can contribute is the further we travel into this zone of darkness the weaker our life functions become and i have no idea why im all right its those stimulants they catch up with you\nthat is an amoeba\nyes for lack of a better term its a very simple form of life in fact its a much simpler form of life than what you re looking at now but that thing can apparently perform all the functions that qualify it as a living organism it can reproduce it can breathe it can eat although i dont know what\nits one of the things we ve got to find out we ve got to take a closer look at it\nperhaps we could risk the shuttlecraft perhaps with a protective shield\nwe could send one man in pinpoint its vulnerable spots\nwho said anything about an order jim you ve got a volunteer ive done the preliminary work\nall rights oid know enough to go slow when we penetrated its vulnerable spots\ndo you think i intend to pass up the greatest living laboratory since\njust because the vulcans failed\nyou dont think your e going\njim that organism contains chemical processes weve never seen before and may never see again we could learn more in one day\njim\nright ill get a few things i need jim\nnothing has been proven yet spock the code analyser will give you the fundamental structure of the thing youll need readings on three light wavelengths from the enzyme recorder\nyour e determined not to let me share in this arent you\nvulcan dignity how can i grant you what i dont understand\ngood luck spock\nyou want to bet\nwell all i know is that soon there ll be two four eight and more the entire anti life matter that that thing puts out could someday encompass the entire galaxy\nhow do you feel\nspock is it me jim am iso sentimental that i just have to keep believing that he s still alive in that mass of protoplasm\nits a disease like a virus invading the body of our galaxy\nmillions\nnow isnt that a though there we are antibodies of our own galaxy attacking an invading germ it would be ironic indeed if that were our sole destiny wouldnt it\ntechnically no medically yes between the stimulants and the pressure i would suggest you try to stay off your feet for a few minutes\nwe couldnt use it wed cook ourselves along with that mess of protoplasm out there\nwhat\nhow close are you going to it\nwhy the probe has a range of\nhow long do you think you can keep taking that stuff itll blow you apart\ndespite what spock said its still plenty sensitive\nspock\nshut up spock were rescuing you\ndont be so smart spock you botched the acetylcholine test\nwe lost five percent of our energy reserve sir our deflector shields are weakened\naye if we dont lose any more dont ask me how it happened\nyes\nim sorry sir im not sure i was trying to recalibrate and we went into reverse\ni dont know sir all i know is that the power levels are down twelve percent and steadily decreasing ive never experienced anything like it\ni dont know sir it goes against the rules of logic\nbut\nthats doing it sir were slowing down but were not stopping were still being dragged forward\nas to the power levels are concerned everything is acting backwards but the drain is continuing on the static test i could only get sixty percent power were still being dragged forward\nbut what\naye captain but ill reserve some for the shields in case we dont get out\nthat ought to do it engineering to captain kirk\nready to try it when you are sir\ni hope so captain\nits no good sir the best we can do is to maintain thrust against the pull and hold our position\naye sir\nat this rate plus the drain on all systems two hours\nengineering to captain kirk\nyou asked me to keep you informed on the power drain all levels are down fifty percent now\nand still draining we can maintain thrust for another hour and fifteen minutes\nsir\nall systems clear for shuttlecraft launch sir\ncaptain he wont have enough power to get back out if he diverts it to his shields\ncaptain the pull from that organism is increasing and the power drain from our shields is getting critical\nno more than an hour now sir\naye sir\nscott here sir\nwere down to forty three percent sir were slipping a bit against the pull that beasties putting on us\nwe cant last more than forty five minutes at this rate of decline less if i have to apply more thrust\ncut the engine thrust wed be sucked into that thing like being caught in a wind tunnel sir\nswitching power to shields impulse in reserve cutting thrust to zero now\ncaptain weve only twenty six percent power reserves after entry\ni saved all i could sir but i dont know whether we have enough to get back out again or time either\naye we are but were committed to what we have no power for the phasers\nthen what the devil begging your pardon sir are we doing\nwe cant use the power to destroy it\naye it couldnt swallow that\nits on its way sir\nsix may be seven minutes sir\naye sir\ncaptain we dont have enough time to do it we only have a fifty three second escape margin\naye sir tractor beams on\naye sir i cant guarantee itll hold when the warhead explodes the power levels are the power levels are dead sir\npowers coming back sir\ni dont know how sir but its still with us\naye sir\ninteresting no indications of magnetic storms in this sector\ncaptain the intrepid it just died and the four hundred vulcans aboard all dead\ndoctor i know what i know\ncaptain\nyes sir\ni assure you doctor i am quite allright the pain was momentary it passed quickly\ni sensed it die\ndoctor even i a half vulcan could hear the death scream of four hundred vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us\ncall it a deep understanding of the way things happen to vulcans but i know not a person not even the computers onboard the intrepid knew what was killing them or would have understood it had they known\nive noticed that about your people doctor you find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of a million you speak about the objective hardness of the vulcan heart yet how little room there seems to be in yours\nit might have rendered your history a bit less bloody\nindications of energy turbulence ahead unable to analyse iven ever encountered readings like this before\ni would assume that\nnot very likely ensign\nstill not able to analyse captain sensors are feeding data to the computers now whatever this dark zone is it lies directly in line with the course i calculate for the intrepid and the gamma seven a system\ni have none captain insufficient data\nlieutenant\nno analysis due to insufficient information\ni am well aware of that captain but the computers contain nothing on this phenomenon it is beyond our experience and the new information is not yet significant\nit is not liquid gaseous or solid despite the fact we can not see through it\nit is not a galactic nebula such as the coal sack and since our deflectors were activated by it it would seem to be some form of energy but nothing our sensors can identify\nvery possible\ncaptain\nanalysing now captain\nnegative captain all systems functioning properly\nunknown captain\nthat sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of a boundary layer captain\nunknown\nbetween where we were and where we are\nit would never occur to me captain\nwe still have no specifics but we seem to have entered a zone of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical processes as we draw closer to the source it grows stronger and we grow weaker\nbridge to captain kirk\nsir we are accelerating we are being pulled toward the centre of the zone of darkness\nunknown captain i suggest you order mister scott to give us reverse power\nin that case captain i would suggest we apply forward thrust\nits logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs all forms of energy whether mechanically or biologically produced whatever it is it would seem to be the same thing which drew all the energy out of an entire solar system and the intrepid\ni would say not captain the analysis of the zone indicates it is a negative energy field however illogical that may sound but it is not the source of the power drain\ni submit mister scott if we do not get out the shields would be extraneous it would only prolong our wait for death by a short period of time\ncaptain the intrepid would have done all these things too and yet they were destroyed\ntrue it is also true they never knew what was killing them their logic would not have permitted them to believe they were being killed\nvulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory the memory goes back so far that no vulcan can conceive of a conqueror i knew the ship was lost because i sensed it\nthe touch of death\nastonishment\ni can not say what it is captain but i would say it has found us\ngetting very confused readings captain but this is definitely the source of the energy drain\nprobe will impact in seven point three seconds\nreadings coming in now captain length approximately eleven thousand miles width varying from two thousand to three thousand miles outer layer studded with space debris and waste interior consists of protoplasm varying from a firmer gelatinous layer to a semi fluid central mass condition living\nthat is what is drawing us toward it captain the same way it drew the intrepid to her death\nenergy itself perhaps drained from us i would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus\nthe intrepid must have come across the organism while it was still low in energy still hungry we are not safe captain we merely have a little more time than the intrepid did\ni must differ with you captain we have sent unmanned probes into it they have given us some information but they have not told us what we need to know and we can not afford the power to take blind shots at it hoping to kill it\nthe thing evidently has reflexes the unmanned probe we sent in must have stung it when it entered the lurch we felt was the turbulence of its reaction\nyou have a martyr complex doctor i submit that it disqualifies you\nthe vulcans saw it first and died\ni am more capable\nwhich makes you indispensable captain further you are not a science specialist\nwe dont have one day doctor we have precisely one hour and thirty five minutes of power left\ncaptain i\ndo not suffer so doctor this is not the first time superior capability has proven more valuable than professional credentials\ni am familiar with the equipment doctor were wasting time the shuttlecraft is ready\nthis is not a competition doctor whether you understand it or not grant me my own kind of dignity\nthen employ one of your own superstitions wish me luck\nshuttlecraft to enterprise\npower drain is enormous and growing worse\ndiverting all secondary power to the shields ill continue communications as long as there is power to transmit\ni heard captain\nwe discussed that possibility earlier but you will need this information\nslowing now contact in eighteen point three seconds brace yourselves the area of penetration will no doubt be sensitive contact\nin six seconds\ni am undamaged captain relay to mister scott i had three percent power reserve before the shields stabilised\nthere was nothing to spare i shall continue my test so hand doctor mccoy you would have not survived it\ni am moving slowly now establishing course toward what appears to be the nucleus\ncalculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven minutes\nhowever i am able to identify the chromosome structure\nchanges indicate the organism has stored sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence\nim having difficulty maintaining ship control\nim losing voice contact i will transmit internal coordinates of chromosome bodies\nthis is spock\ni am slowly losing life support and minimal shield energies according to my calculations\nthe nervous energy of the organism is maximal just within its outer protective membrane relatively insensitive to interior irritation i believe sufficient charge of could destroy the organism tell doctor mccoy he should have wished me luck captains log stardate 43094 we have determined we can destroy the creature provided we can do it from inside the organism spock clearly knew how to destroy it but was unable to transmit that information\npersonal log commander spock enterprise i have noted the passage of the enterprise on its way to whatever awaits it if this record should survive mei wish it known that i bequeath my

spock as you are but if the klingons are breaking the treaty it could be interstellar war kirk to bridge\nmccoy andi are transporting back down inform ships stores that well need native costumes\ni understand well arrange a rendezvous schedule kirk out captains log stardate 42114 keeping our presence here secret is an enormous tactical advantage therefore i can not risk contact with starfleet command i must take action on my own judgment ive elected to violate orders and make contact with planet inhabitants\nperfect tyree scamps a quarter of a mile away\nno interference with normal social development im not only aware of it it was my survey thirteen years ago that recommended it\nindeed and i intend to see that they have that chance you coming with me\ncontact ship took full poison fangs\nthey left out of orbit\ntyree some of his men cure\nbones i had the strangest dream\ntired very tired you did a fine job bones i think ill sleep\nbones what are you doing here tyree my old friend\nwhat ami doing here am uga to bite i remember i told him to take me to tyree scampi knew you d find a kahn uttutocuremethekahnuttu is the local witch people here theyve studied theyve studied the roots and the herbs\nyes of course i shouldve guessed congratulations tyree we must talk now the villagers their new weapons i want to hear all about that we must make plans\nyou say they make the fire sticks themselves how can you be sure\ncan you take us to their village while its still dark\nyouve seen how these work\nwere simply strangers from\ni am grateful\nwe once were as you are spears arrows there came a time when our weapons grew faster than our wisdom and we almost destroyed ourselves we learned from this to make a rule during all our travels never to cause the same to happen to other worlds just as a man must grow in his own way and in his own time\nperhaps not as fast or in the way another think she should but were wise enough to know that we are wise enough not to interfere with the way of a man or another world\nthats what s bothering me the something we may have to do\ntyree supposing you had to fight what then\ntyree\nthe gun ammunition doctor\nlets take a look inside\nwell heres your forge peoples exhibit number on each rome steel drill point\nmake recorder and scanner tapes of everything\nbones\nmove fast\nmen this is the pan this is the hammer the hammer striking the pan causes a spark ignites the powder and fires the flintlock now aim it as i showed you hold your breath and squeeze the trigger gently well done very very very good\nnot here bones in the cave yutan your turn\nexactly each side receives the same knowledge and the same type of firearm\nsuperstition\nis its he wants superior weapons thats the one thing neither side can have bones bones the normal development of this planet was the status quo between the hill people and the villagers the klingons changed that with the flintlock s if this planet is to develop the way it should we must equalize both sides again\nall right doctor all rights a yim wrong say im drugged say the woman drugged me what is your sober sensible solution to all this\nbones do you remember the twentieth century brush wars on the asian continent two giant powers involved much like the klingons and ourselves neither side felt could pull out\nwhat would you have suggested that one side arm its friends with an overpowering weapon mankind would never have lived to travel space if they had not he only solution is what happened back then balance of power\nthen we armour side with exactly that much more a balance of power the trickiest most difficult dirtiest game of them all but the only one that preserves both sides\nno probably not but im going to have to try and make him understand i never had a more difficult task\nwell war isnt a good life but its life his wife is the only way to reach him if i tell her were going to supply guns may be shell convince him\nid like to talk to you\ni would like\ni feel dizzy yes you are lovely your e beautiful\nnon a\nno no im all right my phaser she took it\ntomorrow in the palm of her hands\nnot what i wanted bones what had to be kirk

understand\nyou said you wanted our help what is it you wish\ni am sargon\nhe is unharmed i have taken his body to demonstrate\nlungs filled with air again to see again heart pumping arteries surging with blood again a half a million years to be again your captain has an excellent body doctor mccoy i compliment you both on the condition in which you maintained it\nhave no fear your captain is quite unharmed although his mind generates insufficient energy for him to speak from there as i do\nin the next room there are other receptacles the other two of us that survived you doctor ann mulhall and you mister spock we require your bodies also we must have captain kirk and you so that we may live again\neven for usa half million years is almost too long to wait two others still survive henoch and thalassa thalassa my thalassa i am pleased you survived with me forgive me it has been so very long\nonly the best minds were chosen to survive thalassa my wife as you may have guessed henoch from the other side realising our mistake we attempted to perpetuate both sides we built this chamber here in order to preserve our essence in this fashion\nwe knew the seed that we had planted on other planets would take root that one day you would build vessels as we did and one day you would come here\nand search the heavens with my mind probing waiting probing and then one day my mind touched your vessel and brought you here\nto steal to take them from you no no my children you misunderstand we mean only that you should lend us your bodies for a short time\ni will return your captain to you before the body limit has been reached\nto build to build humanoid robots we must borrow your bodies long enough to have the use of your hands your fingers\nno our methods our skills are far beyond your abilities it is time\nyes sargon borrowed my body i was floating in time and space\nspock i remember when sargon and i exchanged as we passed each other for an instant we were one i know him now i know what he is and what he wants and i dont fear him\nsargon\na simple transference their minds and ours\nscotty i need your approval too since youll work with them furnishing them all they need to make the android robots you wont be working with them youll be working with us our bodies they ll be inside us and well be\nbones theyll show us medical advances miracles you never dreamed possible scotty engineering advances vessels this size with engines the size of walnuts\nthey selected us as the most compatible bodies\nbones you could stop all this by saying no thats why i called you all here together well all be deeply involved it must be unanimous\nthey used to say if man could fly hed have wings but he did fly he discovered he had to do you wish that the first apollo mission hadnt reached the moon or that we had nt gone on to mars and then to the nearest start hats like saying you wish that you still operated with scalpels and sewed your patients up with catgut like your great great great great grandfather used to im in command i could order this but im not because doctor mccoy is right in pointing out the enormous danger potential in any contact with life and intelligence as fantastically advanced as this but i must point out that the possibilities the potential for knowledge and advancement is equally great risk risk is our business thats what the starship is all about thats why were aboard her you may dissent without prejudice do i hear a negative vote engineer standby to beam aboard three receptacles\nready sargon\nthe transference is complete\nhere in this body\nand i too am pleased beloved\nkiss\nwe will vacate at once until you can administer a metabolic reduction injection\nhenoch your condition\nfortunate we will vacate at

perhaps\nyes i wanted to be certain there was no error formula is correct dont be concerned it is an excellent body there you see i feel better already\nthat will take months perhaps years we havent that choice thalassa\nno beloved if we torment ourselves\nour thoughts will intertwine\nyes im fine bones\nit was necessary\nbones prepare a hypo the fastest deadliest poison to vulcans spock s

kept\nis there any way we can help you sargon\ni promise beloved\nforever beloved forever\nwell im sure that sargon appreciated your cooperation doctor mulhall\njim why no briefing on this id at least like to know what were getting into\ninside solid rock\nlets get back to this solid rock business just how much rock are we going to go through\nmiles are you joking\nno no if id be useful as long as your e going down i might as well take a medical look at whatever this is\nthe air seems fresh it must be recirculated somehow\nbut you once had a body of some type\nwhere sour captain wheres jim kirk\ni wont go along with this back to where you were sargon or whatever you are\nare you aware of whats happening to his body heart action doubled temperature a hundred and four degrees\nand destroy them just as your e burning that one up now heartbeats two hundred and sixty two spock entire metabolic rate correspondingly high\nis it you jim good his metabolic rate is back to normal\nhe doesnt appear to be harmed physically anyway\nthats the most ridiculous statement ive ever heard an alien practically hijacks your body and then corks you into a bottle and\nand what if we should decide against you\nno comment\nquite simple happens every day\nit all seems rather indecent to me\ntheyre giants and were insects beside them they could destroy us without meaning to and all he wants is the body of our captain and our second in command too coincidence\nwhats your attitude on that doctor\nthen ill still want one question answered to my satisfaction why not a list of possible miracles but a simple basic understandable why that overrides all danger and lets not kid ourselves that there is no potential danger in this\nthe extreme power of the alien mind will drive the heart action dangerously high and the body functions will race many times their normal metabolism so were going to have to monitor this very carefully\nwell i guess were as ready as well ever be jim\nvulcans

mankind must perish too captains log stardate 47683 the enterprise is in orbit above a planet whose surface our sensors tell us is devoid of all life a world destroyed and dead for at least a half

much as yours my children although our minds were infinitely greater\nbecause it is possible you are our descendants captain kirk six thousand centuries ago our vessels were colonising this galaxy just as your own starships have now begun to explore that vastness as you now leave your own seed on distant planets so we left our seed behind us perhaps your own legends of an adam and an eve were two of our travellers\nin either case i do not know it was so long ago and the records of our travels were lost in the cataclysm which we loosened upon ourselves\na struggle for such goals and the unleashing of such power that you could not comprehend\nand we survived our primitive nuclear era my son but there comes to all races an ultimate crisis which you have yet to face\none day our minds became so powerful we dared think of ourselves as gods\ni understand my son go to your vessel all who are involved must agree to this after all these centuries we can wait a few more hours\nthen you may go as freely as you came\ni am pleased my beloved it is good you have found the truth yourself\ni have power even henoch does not suspect beloved\ni could not allow your sacrifice of one so close to you\nno doctor i allowed you to believe that to be true so that henoch would read your thoughts and believe it also\nbut henoch believed and fled the body he is destroyed\nwe now know we can not permit ourselves to exist in your world my children thalassa and i must now also depart into oblivion\nyes my son you can allow thalassa and me to share your bodies again a last moment together\ni dont like it sir the transporter coordinates preset by an alien of some sort you could materialise inside solid rock\ncan you readme captain\nthey refine they just didnt de materialise\ni dont like it sir\nyour e going to what are they all right in the head doctor\nach your e joking\na starship engine the size of a walnut thats impossible but i dont suppose the red be any harm in looking over

purpose\nthen you intend to construct mechanical bodies move your minds into them and then return our bodies to us\ncaptain do you know what happened do you remember any part of it\nonce inside their mechanical bodies engineer they can leave this planet travel back with us with their knowledge mankind could leap ahead ten thousand years\nno hes not\nhello oh you are a lovely female a pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years\nyour e welcome\nthis is an excellent body doctor i seem to have received the best of the three strength hearing eyesight all far above your human norms im surprised the vulcans never conquered your race\nyes of course just as we do doctor\nit will be unnecessary doctor this vulcan body is accustomed to the higher metabolism\nill prepare the formulas argon\ni can continue in this body for several hours\nthis woman will assist me you will take me to your pharmacology laboratory\nnow this formula will reduce the heart action and the bodily functions to normal while the bodies are occupied you will administer one injection often ccs each hour\nthis hypo you will code mark for thalassa and this one you will code mark for me\nthis one you will administer to captain kirk while sargon is in his body\nnot hats correct but since i will arrange for you to administer each of the injections no one else will notice\nwhat were you saying\nyes well you were about to say that you watched me prepare the formula and fill each of the hypo s\nvery good you see sargon would not permit me to keep this body it is therefore necessary for you to kill your captain so that sargon will die with him enterprise medical log stardate 47691 three alien minds now inhabit the bodies of captain kirk science officer spock and doctor ann mulhall\nin two days youll

build another one and well lock ourselves into it for another thousand years and another and another sargon has closed his mind to a better way with these bodies\nwhen you awoke in this body thalassa you said how good it was to breathe again to have eyes and to see again to feel to live and feel again thalassa just think how much we can do for mankind are these bodies too much to ask for in return would you prefer this\nthis is your new home thalassa once occupied ill add female features and some texturing you no doubt want the mechanism to at least appear to be a woman it is ready thalassa\nyou have no excuse to keep the real body any longer sargon wouldve required that you enter the mechanism immediately\nmust i make an example of you too helm\npain captain and you my dear\nfortunately doctor i know every thought of every mind around me see take the hypo from him and inject him with it\nfools ill simply transfer to another place another body\nsargon no sargon

gathering mission on planet alpha 177 unknown to any of us during this time a duplicate of me some strange alter ego had been created by the transporter malfunction\nit might profit you to let doctor mccoy give you the once over\ntransporter breakdown continue circuit testing we beamed up this animal and well look for yourself its in this specimen case\na few seconds after they sent this one up through the transporter that duplicate appeared except its not a duplicate its an opposite two of the same animal but different one gentle this one mean and fierce that some kind of savage ferocious opposite captain we dont dare send mister sulu and the landing party up if this should happen to a man\ni dont know sir but when fisher came up his suit was covered with a soft yellow or e that had highly unusual properties it may have caused an overload cant tell not yet\nyes sir but we dont dare bring up the landing party it might be duplicated like this animal\ncant say sir\nwere doing everything we can sir\ncaptain kirk\nmister scott sir on the lower level of the engineering deck\nive found a new trouble with the transporter the casing has a wide gap ripped init the main

were acting like a wildman demanded brandy\nhmm well in that case if you ll excuse the intrusion captain ill get back to my work\ncaptain\ndoctor mccoy reports that you demanded this brandy in sickbay and left with it i found this bottle in yeoman rands quarters\nyou can go now yeoman theres only one logical answer we have an impostor aboard captains log stardate 16729 on the planets surface temperatures are beginning to drop our landing party therein growing jeopardy due to the malfunction of the ships transporter an unexplained duplicate of myself definitely exists\nabout your double captain\nwe cant take a chance on killing it we have no previous experience no way of knowing what would happen to you\nhow shall we explain it to them captain the search parties are to capture you\nthe search parties captain\ncaptain no disrespect intended but you must surely realise you cant announce the full truth to the crew your e the captain of this ship you havent the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew you cant afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect if you do they lose faith and you lose command\nunderstood captain captains log stardate 16731

locked\nthermal heaters were transported down they duplicated they wont operate\nspock here\nacknowledged continue the search\napparently this double however different in temperament has your knowledge of the ship it screw its devices this being the case perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move knowing how the ship is laid out where would you go to elude a mass search\nset and locked on base cycle to stun not to kill what about your phaser captain dont you think we ought to get some help captain\ncaptain you ordered me to tell you\njudging from my observations captain your e rapidly losing the power of decision\nyes always doctor we have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind or to examine in earth terms the roles of good and evil in a man his negative side which you call hostility lust violence and his positive side which earth people express as compassion love tenderness\nyes and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader we see indications that its his negative side which makes him strong that his evil side if you will properly controlled and disciplined is vital to his strength your negative side removed from you the power of command begins to elude you\nif your power of command continues to weaken youll soon be unable to function as captain you must be prepared for that\nif i seem insensitive to what you re going through captain understand its the way i am\nthis is spock mister sulu youll have to hold on a little longer theres no other way survival procedures mister sulu\ncaptain kirk\nspock here would you come to the transporter room we think we may have found an answer\nweve attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference tied directly into the impulse engines there shouldnt be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance i suggest we send the animal through captain\nits painless and quick the animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes\nenergise reverse\nthe shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him\nfor once i agree with you\nno autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified confused it was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again thus shock induced by blind terror\nit couldnt understand you can you have your intelligence controlling your fear\narent you for getting something captain\nyour men on the planet surface how much time do they have left\nbeing split in two halves is no theory with me doctor i have a human half you see as well as an alien half submerged constantly

gill your fuhrer hes one of our people\nim captain james kirk of the united spaceship enterprise this is my first officer mister spock john gill your fuhrer was sent hereby the federation as a cultural observer\nthat was not his mission ever he was sent here to observe not to interfere something went wrong and thats why were here to find out and to correct we must see him\nmaximum security

dar as secretary to the national socialist party\nthe colonel is drunk hes had a little too much to drink\nyes he thought he would embarrass the fuhrer\nnor do i but luck is something you also fail to recognise mister spock\nlets go\nwatch his mouth\nrandom sentences strung together\ngentlemen i want a picture of you two with the hero of the fatherland listening to the stirring fuhrer s speech get

through to him with a mind probe if you cant bones youll have to use a stronger stimulant no matter what it does\nthat would mean the death of thousands of ekos ian spacemen\nwe could save zeon but what about ekos\nwell done spock theyve kept whats left of him as a figurehead\ngill gill why did you abandon your mission why did you interfere with this culture\nbut why nazi germany you studied history you knew what the nazis were\nbut it was brutal perverted had to be destroyed at a terrible cost why that example\nwhy gill why\ngill gill gill can you hear me you ve got to tell those people

simply that their leaders were evil psychotic men they were but the main problem i think was the leader principle\ngentlemen gentlemen weve just been through one civil war lets not start another

the fuhrer has ordered our glorious capital to be made zeon free starting at dawn our heroic troops have begun flushing out the zeon monsters who ve been poisoning our planet\nthe fuhrer s headquarters reports repulsing an attack by zeon spacecraft our missiles utterly destroyed the enemy\nat this patriotic demonstration deputy fuhrer mel akon presented the iron cross second class to dar as hero of the fatherland everywhere preparations go forward toward the final decision death to zeon long live the fatherland long live the fuhrer\nstarfleet s been trying for six months if he s alive isnt it unlikely that hed receive us now\nthats generations ahead of where these people should be technically how d they manage that\nhe must be dead and whats going on down there one kos\nwhat have you got jim\nstupid computer made a mistake in the measurements the right boots too tight\nhow do you do what in blazes is this\nhe looks drugged jim almost at a cat alep tic state\ni have to

risky\nim working in the dark i could kill him\nthe stimulants working\nhes reaching a level of consciousness its almost like he sin a light sleep now thats as much as id are do\nhes still alive but the drug they use is too strong if i give him another shot\ni dont dare\nwhat he s saying spock is that a man who holds that much power even with the best intentions just cant resist the urge to play god\nit also proves another earth saying absolute power corrupts absolutely darn clever these earth men wouldnt you say\nspock you obviously dont understand\nhail the fuhrer\nthe fuhrer has given us our orders and we pledge him our lives in this sacred task death to zeon\nbut despite our best efforts they remain like a cancer eating away at our state\nten minutes ago on our fuhrer s orders our troops began their historic mission\nin the cities the eliminations have started within an hour the zeon blight will forever be removed from ekos\ni now announce the glorious final solution\nour entire solar system will forever be rid of the disease that was zeon\nour space fleet is on its way toward zeon both manned and unmanned weapons\nthis is the time of destiny hail victory\nwhat is this\nno not a zeon definitely not\nvery difficult note the sinister eyes and the malformed ears definitely an inferior race\nnote the low forehead denoting stupidity the dull look of a trapped animal you may take him now for interrogation but i want the body saved for the cultural museum hell make an interesting display\ngo to the booth see to the fuhrer at once he sill turn off that camera\ni suggest we leave and let our fuhrer rest\nlieutenant what have we here aze on\nwith all zeon pigs lieutenant\nwith pleasure today we have a surprise planned for you zeon\naye sir whatever your condition\nyou z eons what kind of monsters are the zeon s sending against us\nwhat do you mean\npassing outer planet zeon\ni never met john gill but i studied earth history from the text he prepared\nwhat impressed me most was his treatment of earth history as causes and motivations rather than dates and events\nyes but it must be a zeon ship zeon s do have a crude interplanetary capability reaction powered a small rocket it is on an intercept course that would mean it has sophisticated detection devices which neither zeon nor ekos should have\ncaptain it san unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a warhead\nfascinating a thermonuclear warhead\nmost interesting we were attacked by a thermonuclear missile from a planet which should have no such weapon\naccording to our records the ekos ians are a primitive warlike people in a state of anarchy the other planet zeon has a relatively high technology and its people are peaceful\nready captain\nthe ekos ians are humanoid so there is apt to be a similarity in architecture interesting\ncaptain the noninterference directive\nmid twentieth century earth the nation state called nazi germany\nvirtually impossible captain yet the evidence is quite clear\nfascinating\nyou propose we pass ourselves off as nazis captain\nthats very well taken captain\nyes obviously hes not one of us i captured him is that not correct procedure with enemies of the fatherland\ntake charge of him\nyour uniform captain\nquite correct you should make a very convincing nazi\nyes is hall tend to it major\nobviously\nwhy do the nazis hate zeon s\nis zeon a threat to them\nit would seem the assumption was premature\nthat would coincide with the time of john gills arrival\ncaptain the flaw in the plan is this locked door and the guard beyond it to the logical mind the outlook is somewhat gloomy\nyes\nof course the rub indium crystals in the transponders\nyes we must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance which i believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres\ntwenty seven point two millimetres would be approximately there that is of course a crude estimation\nyes to reach that light i shall require some sort of platform\nnow the rub indium crystals should find enough power here to achieve the necessary stimulus as i recall from the history of physics the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary excitation even using crude natural crystals\nyes of course captain you realise that the aim will of course be very crude\ncaptain why should i aim at such a structure\nmay i remind you we did not intend to fight\npossibly\ni do not see them\ncaptain without phasers and until we are able to communicate with the ship it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against the entire military force of this planet\ncaptain i suggest the most profitable use of our time would be to reassemble our communicators may iwork undisturbed somewhere\nby using parts from both ive completed one communicator i do not know if the circuits are correct captain there is no way to test it except in actual use\nthe one receiving a medal\nthis young lady is a nazi a hero of the fatherland we saw her being decorated\nthat is correct\nas an honoured member of the party she could get us past the guards\ncaptain im beginning to understand why you earth men enjoy gambling no matter how carefully one computes the odds of success there is still a certain exhilaration in the risk\ncaptain it was john gill but he never moved never once looked up\nor a deep psychosis\nit may not have the range it had in fact it may not work at all\nspock to enterprise spock to enterprise come in enterprise\nif there s going to be a delay in transporting the doctor i suggest we cancel our\nthere is a logical way to proceed doctor point your toe apply equal pressure to either side of the boot and push we have no time for emotionalism\nyes a doctor should have more pride\ncaptain i do not understand how he failed to recognise us\ntrue i shall reconsider\ncaptain the speech follows nological pattern\nwhat drug\ncaptain i have created a condition in which gill can not initiate speech or any other action but he can reply to questions\nquite correct for the last few years the real power has been mel akon\nquite true captain that tiny country beaten bankrupt defeated rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global domination\nperhaps gill felt that such a state run benignly could accomplish its efficiency without sadism\nis he dead captain\nindeed captain with the union of two cultures this system would make a fine addition to the federation\ncaptain i never will understand humans how could a man as brilliant a mind as logical as john gills have made such a fatal error\nthank you doctor i was able to gather the meaning\nyes earth men like ramses alexander caesar napoleon hitler lee kuan your whole earth history is made up of men seeking absolute power\nobviously doctor you fail to accept\naye aye sir\ncaptain no response on any starfleet channel\nnothing sir\ncaptain no response from john gill on any channel\nenterprise lieutenant uhura\nyes sir captain were not reading you

explode on my signal\nyour people are most efficient captain\nhana r start the neutralising operation\nyou humans are troublesome for us we needed you to get us through the barrier but there are nt enough of us to efficiently guard all of you of the time further the food synthesisers can not manufacture enough food for the entire journey we are therefore neutralising all nonessential personnel\nthe procedure is already underway no was to bridge personnel drea we have no need for communication\nand since drea is capable of handling the ship from here on\ndo you not agree that this is better thing for them than exploding the ship as your engineer had thought to do we detected it of course to mar has devised a mechanism to prevent any further tampering please accept your

theyll attack anything that moves\nour medi scanners revealed this planet as perfectly harmless the villagers the koh ms here were friendly enough once they got over the shock of my white skin as youve seen we resemble the yangs the savages my landing party transported back to the ship i stayed down here to arrange for the planet survey with the village elders the next thing i knew the ship

some natural immunisation that protects everyone on the planet surface i dont know what it is\nyou dbe dying by now along with the rest of the enterprise crew youll stay alive only as long as you stay here none of us will ever leave this planet captains log supplemental the enterprise has left the exeter and moved into close planet orbit although it appears the infection may strand us here the rest of our lives i face an even more difficult problem a growing belief that captain tracey has been interfering with the evolution of life on this planet it seems impossible a star captains most solemn oath is that he will give his life even his entire crew rather than violate the prime directive\nill be sending the next message jim\nenterprise come in\ncaptain tracey of the exeter\nim afraid i have some bad news your captain and landing party must have beamed down too late for full immunisation\nthey ve been found unconscious but im doing everything ican for them now\ntheres no point in risking

this will put him in there\nno messages kirk the savage in the cell with you did you set him free you sent him kirk you sent him to warn the tribes the yangs must ve been warned they sacrificed

scotty turn it off\nthat wasnt a minor difficulty that wasnt a robot that thing murdered one of my crewman and you tell me you cant turn it off\nand how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way\nspock scotty come with me\nreport spock\nwell reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an hour we must regain control of the ship by then\nscotty\nhow long\nmake it less\nhes with the m5unit watching it i think it surprised even him\ndid you find anything\ngenius is an understatement at the age of twenty four he made the duo tronic breakthrough that won him the nobel and zee magnes prizes\nisnt that enough for one lifetime\nall right its difficult whats your point\ngenius doesnt work on an assembly line basis did einstein kazan ga or sitar of vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule you cant simply say today i will be brilliant no matter how long it took he came out with multitronic sthem5\nand he wont let spock near it what are you saying that he s tampering with it that he s making it act that way why\nnow hes got you talking about that machine like a personality\nkirk here\ngood get day strom were on our way lets go\nwere going to find out doctor\nspock\ngood go ahead\nday strom were going to do our best\nspock\nbridge this is kirk sulu\nwe ve got helmand navigational control turn us about have mister chekov plot a course back to the space station\nkirk here\ngo to the engineering station\nwhile it was getting ready for what spock\ndoctor day strom doctor day strom i want an answer right now im tired of hearing about the m5s new approach what is it exactly what is it\nwell doctor\nyour new approach\nkirk here what is it\nthe main attack force the war games\ncorrection bones those four ships dont know it sm5sgameandm5 is going to destroy them\nput it on\ndays tromdoesm5 understand that this is only a drill\nfull strength\nthats no miscalculation\nestimate damage on lexington spock\ntheres got to be a way of getting to the m5 theres got to be away\nlieutenant\ntheres your murder charge deliberate calculated its killing men and women four starships sixteen hundred men and women\nday strom\nwhose engrams\nthe computer tie in you spoke to it before it knows you\nyou can save them 5 if you talk to it and make it stop the attack\nyou d better pray that the m5 listens to the sound of himm5\nspock the m5 is not responding to him like a computer its talking to him\nthe m5 must be destroyed\nsecurity take him to sickbay\ntake care of him doctor\nbattle status\ngo on\ntheyve just signed their own death warrant m5 will kill them to survive\nsuppose its still open to impression suppose it absorbed the regret day strom felt for the deaths it caused the guilt\nthe instrument of his death will not be the enterprise if i can help itm5tieinm5\nthis is captain kirk you will be under attack in a moment m5\nyou have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly crippled many lives were lost m5\nwhym5\nthere were many men aboard those ships they were murdered must you survive by murder m5\nwhym5\nbut you have murdered scan the starship excalibur which you destroyed is there life aboard m5\nbecause you murder edit what is the penalty for murder m5\nand how will you pay for your acts of murder m5\nm5\nscotty spock before it changes its mind get down to engineering pull out every hookup that makes m5run pull out the plug spock\nlieutenant\nintership communications this is the captain speaking in approximately one minute well be attacked by federation starships the m5 no longer controls the ship but neither do we control itthem5 has left itself and us open for destruction for whatever satisfaction we may get from the knowledge our nineteen lives will buy the survival of over one thousand of our fellow starship crewmen\nkirk here\ni need communications\nthen cut power\ncut power keep those shields down\nthats exactly the situation i was hoping for when i forced them 5 to realise it had committed murder\nday strom felt such an act was against the laws of god and man the computer that carried his engrams also believed it\ni wasnt sure any other commander would have simply followed orders and destroyed us butik new bob wesley\ni gambled on his humanity\nbridge his logical selection was compassion\nmister sulu take us back to the space station ahead warp

me in on it\nvery funny if it could they wouldnt have to replace me id resign because everybody else aboard would be nothing but circuits and memory banks you know the type spock jim you havent had much to say about this\nfrankly the only fact that im concerned about is if this thing doesnt work there are not enough men aboard to run the ship thats begging for trouble\ndoctor leonard mccoy senior medical officer\nis it supposed to do that\ndid you see the love light in spock s eyes the right computer finally came along whats the matter jim\ni think its wrong too replacing men with mindless machines\njim weve all seen the advances of mechanisation after all day strom did design the computers that run this ship\nwere all sorry for the other guy when he loses his job to a machine when it comes to your job thats different and it always will be different\njim if you have the awareness to ask yourself that question you dont need me to answer it for you why dont you ask james t kirk hes a pretty honest guy\nall the sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the m5is informed there are patients to be cared for\nduns el who the blazes is captain duns el what does it mean jim spock what does it mean\nthis isnt chicken soup i maybe just a ships doctor but i make a finagle s folly thats known from here to orion i strongly prescribe it jim\nto james t kirk captain of the enterprise\nsimple but effective\nit saline from a poem a very old poem isnt it\njim\nfantastic machine the m5no off switch\nnormal that things trying to tell us nothing has happened\nthere certainly does your brilliant young computer just destroyed an or e freighter in fact it went out of its way to destroy an or e freighter\nin which case you d be guilty of murder\nand communications and fire control\nill get the man responsible in the first place where is day strom\nplease spock dome a favour and dont say its fascinating\nhave you found a solution a way to shut that thing off\nlearning to kill\nthat thing is a danger to us all now find some way to shut it off\nthe biographical tape of richard day strom\nnot much aside from the fact hes a genius\nin his early twenties jim thats over a quarter of a century ago\nmay be thats the trouble where do you go from up you publish articles you give lectures then spend your life trying to recapture past glory\nthe m1throughm4 remember not entirely successful thats the way day strom put it\nright the government bought it then day strom had to make it work and he did but according to spock it works illogically\njim if a man had a child who d gone antisocial killed perhaps he d still tend to protect that child\nim afraid thats the way he thinks about it\ndecoy edit wanted us to waste our time\nbutm5 doesnt know its a game\nif that thing cuts loose against unshielded ships were in\nof course\ni dont like the sound of him jim\njim hes on the edge of a nervous breakdown if not insanity\nhell have to be committed to a total rehabilitation centre right now hes under sedation and heavy restraints\ncompassion thats the one thing no machine ever had maybe its the one thing that keeps men ahead of them care to debate that spock\nbut tell me which do you prefer to have around\ni was just trying to make conversation spock\nhe was here doctor\naye aye sir mister harper\ncaptain power shutdowns on deck four lights environmental control\nthe powers gone of fondeckfivem5\ncaptain ive located the source of the power shutdown sits the m5unitsir that things turning off systems all over the ship\nreverse thrusts will not engage sir manual override isnt working either\ncaptain i suggest we disconnect it at the source\nso now it has virtually unlimited power captain what ll we do\naye i can take them out and cut in the manual override from there\nif mister spock helps me may be an hour\naye thats got it mister spock\nthats it mister spock\nbut it was active ids take all that i know that it was\nsystems coming back i can give you power for the shields sir\nthat ll take longer\nsir\ncommodore wesley how do you do sir\nthe most ambitious computer complex ever created its purpose is to correlate all computer activity aboard a starship to provide the ultimate in vessel operation and control\niholdana7 computer expert classification commodore im well acquainted with doctor days troms theories and discoveries the basic design of all our ships computers are doctor days troms\nwe are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently than man\nthe most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship surgeon\ni am honoured doctor\nfascinating doctor this computer has a potential beyond anything youve ever done even your breakthrough in duo tronics did not have the promise of this\nthe m5 has been perfected commander its potential is a fact\nif i can be of assistance doctor\nm5 has performed admirably so far\ncaptain i am forced to agree with doctor day strom with the course information plotted into i this computer could have brought us here as easily as the navigator in fact it might have been a further demonstration of m5s capability\nenjoy captain no im merely gratified to see doctor days troms new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly efficient manner m5 is another distinguished triumph for his career\nthe planet is class m captain oxygen nitrogen atmosphere suitable for human life support two major landmasses a number of islands life form readings\nm5s readout captain\ncaptain the computer does not judge it makes logical selections\ni am not familiar with these instruments doctor you are using an entirely new type of control mechanism however it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before\ndoctor this unit is not a human body the computer can process information but only the information which is put into it\ncaptain sensors report two contact snow one on the port bow one on the stern distance two hundred thousand kilometres and closing\nwe are not scheduled for wargames in this area this may be a surprise attack as a problem for the m5\nphaser hit on port deflector four captain\nattacking vessels are moving off\nminor hit on deflector screen four no appreciable damage\nthe ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have manoeuvred her tactics deployment of weapons all indicate an immense sophistication in computer control\npractical captain perhaps but not desirable computers make excellent and efficient servants but i have no wish to serve under them captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man and nothing can replace it or him\nduns el doctor is a term used by midshipmen at starfleet academy it refers to a part which serves no useful purpose\nanother contact captain a large slow moving vessel\nunidentified this is not a drill\nm5 has identified her captain the woden listed in starfleet registry as an old style or e freighter converted to automation no crew coming into visual range\nno effect on any of the m5 controls captain\ncaptain photon torpedoes locking on target full power\nall systems report normal captain\ni would say captain that m5 is not only capable of taking care of this ship it is also capable of taking care of itself\nm5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines tapping the matter antimatter reserves\nthe multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly from the warp engines the computer now controls all helm navigation and engineering functions\nthere is one possibility the automatic helm navigation circuit relays might be disrupted from engineering level three\nmost illogical of all people he should have known how the computer would perform of course the m5 itself has not behaved logically\nno but it is interesting\ngood\nspock to captain kirk\nwe are ready captain\nmister scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter as he does so i shall trip the manual override into control\nmanual override is in control captain\nmister chekov\nexamine the h two seven nine elements also the g nine five systems\nthank you ensign\nit appears captain we ve been doing what used to be called pursuing a wildgoose m5hasreroutedhelm and navigational controls bypassing this primary system\ni believe that when m5 discovered our tampering it rerouted the controls leaving this one active by simply sending through an electronic impulse at regular intervals\ni do not know it is not performing in a logical manner\ni do not mean to offend sir but it behaves with an almost human pattern\nattack force closing rapidly breaking formation attacking at will\nhit on the lexington\nhit in engineering section possible damage to her impulse engines shes still maneuverable on warp drive\nthe excalibur a direct hit\nlexington hit again\nprobably true captain it works faster thinks faster than we do it is a human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible in a computer\ndoctor day strom you impressed human engrams on the m5 circuits\nthen perhaps you could talk to the unit m5 has no reason to believe you would harm it\ni am most impressed with the technology captain doctor day strom has created a mirror image of his mind m5\nfascinating\nevery living thing wants to survive captain day strom must have impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer\ncommodore wesley is a dedicated commander i should regret serving aboard the instrument of his death\ncaptain attack force almost within phaser range\nm5 is leaving itself open to attack the machine is committing suicide to a tone for the sin of murder\nspock to captain\nthe force field is gone captain m5is neutralised\ni would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same condition\ncaptain why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire when they saw the enterprise apparently vulnerable logically that is the sort of trapm5 should have set\nno doctor i simply maintain that computers are more efficient than human beings not better\ni presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between machines and human beings and i believe i have already answered that question\nit would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on a computer doctor the resulting torrential flood of illogic would be most entertaining\nyou are

roast kid lovely thing isnt she\ncontamination cant risk that oh youll understand as you learn more about us\ninteresting and you captain which world do you prefer\nare designed to circumvent any such order there may be over four hundred men on your ship captain but they can be brought down if its handled properly say a few at a time you see i have the advantage of a trained ship captain to tell me what is and what is not possible your communicator captain kirk now do save us all a lot of unnecessary trouble and issue the appropriate orders\ni believe this captain that you would do almost anything rather than see these two dear friends put slowly to death\nvery wise of you captain no point in sending up bullet ridden corpses\ni do hope so for your sake now captain what are you going to order your men to do\nyou could probably defeat the combined armies of our entire empire and violate your oath regarding non interference with other societies i believe you all swear youll die before

ive observed him thoroughly your species has no such strength\ni see no evidence of superiority they fight no better than your men did m erik us perhaps not as well\nyour opinion m erik us after all theyre like yourself\nyour opinion captain kirk would you like me to kill them now an easy death then you d gladly accept whatever happens to you take them back to their cage well it wont go that easily for them captain nor for you take him to my quarters\ncaptain im sorry i was detained should we have our little talk now so far on this planet weve kept you rather busy i dont wonder you slept through the afternoon by the way one of the communicators we took from you is missing was it my pretty drusilla by any chance\nsee if he has it not that i would have punished her i would have blamed you your ear oman kirk or you should have been its not on his person\ni am sorry i was detained i trust there was nothing further you required\nbecause your e amani owe you that you must die shortly and because you are a man would you leave us m erik the thoughts of one man to another can not possibly interest you\nbecause you are amani gave you some last hours as a man\nunfortunately we must demonstrate that defiance is intolerable\nbut ive learned to respect you i promise you you will die easily quickly\nwhen their time comes the same of course guards take him to the arena oh weve

me ive never lied to one who owns me\ni was concerned i am ordered to please you\ntorture i do not understand i do not wish to see you tortured in anyway at the first sign of pain you will tell me\ndont move hands in the air\ni said dont move\nwho are you\nwhere are you from what do you call those\nare you trying to be funny\nuniforms probably some new praetorian guard unit i should kill you here but septimus would probably be displeased move move\ni didnt harm them septimus as much as i wanted to\nthere is only one true belief roman butchers sent hereby the first citizen\na roman lie we must kill them\nseptimus i know killing is evil but sometimes its necessary\nbut they ve located us our hiding place its better to kill a few of them than all of us\nalmost six i was there when he became lord of the games if he is your friend you are no friends of ours\nwell wait here until dark\nyou are barbarians indeed not to know of flavius maximus for seven years i was the most successful gladiator in this province\nyes the words of peace and freedom it wasnt easy for me to believe i was trained to fight but the words the words are true\nlong ago there were rebellions but they were suppressed and with each century the slaves acquired more rights under the law they received rights to medicine the right to government payments in their old age and they slowly learned to be content\nare they enemies captain\nlong ago perhaps as long ago as the beginning of the empire the message of the sun that all men are brothers was kept from us perhaps im a fool to believe it it does

let your human half peek out thats it isnt it insecurity why you wouldnt know what to do with a genuine warm decent feeling\ni know im worried about jim too\njim\nwhat happened jim\ncaptain i see on your report flavius was killed i am sorry i liked that huge sun worshiper\na philosophy of total love and total brotherhood\nwell done jim im afraid it isnt that easy they ve been handling slaves here for two thousand years\nyes its me this is our proconsul claudius marcus\nthis way your friends too there slots to talk about lots to explain\ndont judge me before you know the facts come on we can talk freely here the proconsul knows who and what we are\nyou can leave us\nwell a celebration a meeting of old friends\nthis other is your ships surgeon\nits a pity we cant let him loose in our hospitals our level of medicine would improve immeasurably im sure\nwe had meteor damage jimi went ashore with a landing party to look for iridium or e for repairs and i met this gentleman\nhe convinced me it would be unfair to this world to carry word of their existence elsewhere\nso i made the decision to stay\nthis is an ordered world jim a conservative world based on time honoured roman strengths and virtues\ntheres been no war here for over four hundred years jim could lets say your land of that sameera make that same boast i think you can see why they dont want to have their stability contaminated by dangerous ideas of other ways and other places\nand as for my men those that were able to adapt to this world are still alive those who couldnt adapt are dead thats the way it is with life everywhere isnt it\njust as i did jim your e going to order your own people ashore\ntheyre going to be arriving soon anyway jim are con party then a rescue party then another rescue party i had less men it added up the same\njim youve already started a message your engineers waiting what are you going to do\nah that was stupid jim this is not an academy training test this is for real they retaking you to die ships log stardate 40412 chief engineer scott recording captain kirk and his landing party have checked in\nmost of my men went the same way i hoped i would feel it less with yours\nmaybe now you understand why i gave in the romans have always been the strongest and theyve had practice for over two thousand years in enslaving men using them killing them\nhe commands not just a spaceship proconsul but a starship a very special vessel and crew i tried for such a command\nits your decision proconsul\nno proconsul\nstarship lock in on this three to be am\nscott here captain\nscanning sir\ntwelve captain\nbridge scott here\nwe were becoming concerned captain you were a bit overdue\nbut they have used the code term condition green which means they re in trouble but it also prohibits my taking any action mister chekov pinpoint power source locations type power load factors and how much our beams will have to pull to overload them\nlet it take time lad theyre in trouble and im under orders not to interfere however no order can stop me from frightening them it may do no good but it may suggest to someone just what a starship can really do aye\nnow mister chekov activate\nenterprise to captain kirk ready to beam up three captains log stardate 40417 note commendation engineering officer scott despite enormous temptation\nthank you captain\nkeep always in your mind flavius that our way is peace\noh are you children of the sun\nthen are you slaves like ourselves\nno\ntell me the empire has a device like that flavius and you may kill them otherwise accept them as friends captains log stardate 40407 on the surface of planet four system eight nine two the landing party has won the confidence of what obviously is a group of runaway slaves they dwell in caves not far from a large city wear rags live under primitive conditions but they are creatures of a heavily industrialised twentieth century type planet very much like earth an amazing example of hodgkins slaw of parallel planet development but on this earth rome never fella world ruled by emperors who can trace their line back two thousand years to their own julius and augustus caesars\nno captain im sure i would have heard of the arrival of other men like you\nthere are no other worlds\nlights shining through from heaven it is where the sun is blessed be the sun\ntaken from the names of false gods when i was a senator i worshiped them too but i heard the words of the sun i became a brother for that they made me a slave\nmy advice to you is to leave go back where you came from\nm erik us\nm erik us is first citizen butcher\nperhaps five years\nfirst i must discuss it with the others\nwe have decided flavius will guide you we will provide you with suitable clothing i caution you take great care the police are everywhere may the blessings of the sun be upon you\nno doubt about it captain the space debris comes from the survey vessels s beagle\nportions of the antimatter nacelles personal belongings captain no signs of bodies whatsoever\nit would have come from planet four star system eight nine two directly ahead\nss beagle small class four star drive vessel crew of forty seven commanded by jimi believe you knew him captain rmm erik\ndifferent in shape only captain the proportion of land to water is exactly as on your earth density five point five diameter seven nine one seven at the equator atmosphere seventy eight percent nitrogen twenty one percent oxygen again exactly like earth\ni also picked up indications of large cities\nno sign of atomic power as yet but far enough along for radiocommunications power transportation an excellent road system\ntelevision was the colloquial term\ncaptain the one described as the barbarian is also listed here flight officer william b harrison of the ss beagle at least there were some survivors down there\nbut hardly more practical captain close to the city we located but not populated we should not be observed\nfascinating this atmosphere is remarkably similar to your twentieth century moderately industrialised pollution containing substantial amounts of carbon monoxide and partially consumed hydrocarbons\nyes i believe that was the term i had no idea you were that much of a historian doctor\nthen the prime directive is in full force captain\ni fail to see the humour in that situation doctor\ncomplete earth parallel the language here is english\nthere would seem to be evidence to that effect\ni call them ears\nnever colloquial twentieth century english an amazing parallel\nsir we came here looking for some friends forty seven of them who were stranded here some six years ago they wore clothing similar to ours have you heard of such men\ncaptain i thought you might find this interesting\nfascinating\ncaptain a logical question if i may septimus how many years ago did m erik us become your first citizen\ncurious captain the similarity in names were you told why m erik was dropped from the space academy\nwhy doctor\neven more fascinating slavery evolving into an institution with guaranteed medical payments old age pensions\ndoctor if i were able to show emotion your new infatuation with that term would begin to annoy me\nreally doctor i had no idea they were trained watching you i assumed it was trial and error\ninteresting and given a conservative empire quite understandable\nis aid i understood it doctor i find the checks and balances of this civilisation quite illuminating\nthey do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars doctor\nsituations quite familiar to the six million who died in your first world war the eleven million who died in your second the thirty seven million who died in your third shall i go on\nquite correct\ni tell you im well able to defeat you\ni do not want to injure you\nneed any help doctor\nsuch emotions are foreign to me doctor im merely testing the strength of the door\ndoctor i am seeking a means of escape will you please be brief\nyes thats quite true\noh yes you humans have that emotional need to express gratitude your e welcome i believe is the correct response however doctor you must remember i am entirely motivated by logic the loss of our ships surgeon whatever i think of his skill would mean a reduction in the efficiency of the enterprise and therefore\nreally doctor\nwhat did they do to you\ni wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely it seems illogical for a sun worshiper to develop a philosophy of total brotherhood sun worship is usually a primitive superstition religion\nit will replace their imperial rome but it will happen in their twentieth century\ncaptain both amplitude and frequency modulation being used i think i can pick up something visual its a news broadcast using a system i think they once called video\naye\ntransmission lost sir shall i try to get it back\nim afraid you have it all wrong mister spock all of you ive been monitoring some of their old style radio waves the empire spokesman trying to ridicule their religion but he couldnt dont you understand its not the sun up in the sky its the son of

originating at least one thousand light years away\nif what he says is true captain every second we delay him could be dangerous\na most difficult decision captain\nquite a lovely animal captain i find myself strangely drawn to it\nhe did say his planet was hidden captain\ncurrent earth crises would fill a tape bank captain there will be an important assassination today an equally dangerous government coup in asia and this could be highly critical the launching of an orbital nuclear war head platform by the united states countering a similar launch by other powers\nmost definitely once the sky was full of orbiting h bombs the slightest mistake could have brought one down by accident setting off a nuclear holocaust\nhe might be inclined to prepare a perfect one captain but then again he may be telling the truth\nfollowing him down is a major risk captain if we ourselves do anything that changes history\nin here captain\nchances are hes out of sight inside the rocket gantry or at one of the control centres\nhere let me help you sergeant its operated with this dial here\ni can try captain\ni can estimate some of this captain but without more time\nit is difficult to know which is best captain\nwithout facts the decision can not be made logically you must rely on your human intuition\ncorrection mister seven it appears we did not interfere the enterprise was part of what was supposed to happen on this day in 1968\nand you ll be pleased our records show that it resulted in a new and stronger international agreement against the use of such weapons\ncaptain we could say that

read almost exactly alike there is just a slight difference which got him sir\nsir transporter room has the coordinates and is ready for beaming\nentering neutral zone captain\ncaptain kirk\ni dont think so but we have an important matter to discuss and your superficial courtesies are an overture to that discussion you are the first officer\nis peak first with the captain you may wait outside\nthe matter of trespass into romulan space is one of galactic import a violation of treaties now i ask you simply what is your mission here\na starship one of the starfleet s finest vessels your e saying instrument failure as radical as you suggest went unnoticed until you were well past the neutral zone\ni see but you were able to navigate with this malfunction\nbut i doubt it ll clear you of espionage\nyour language has always been most difficult for me captain perhaps you have another word for it\ncaptain if a romulan vessel ventured far into federation territory without good explanation what would a starbase commander do you see it works both ways i hardly believe you are the injured party spock come in\nthe captain has made his statement\ni must admit some surprise on seeing you spock we were not aware of vulcans aboard the enterprise\nquite so yet there are certain ships certain officers that are known to us your situation appears most interesting\nhe is a vulcan our forebears had the same roots and origins something you wouldnt understand captain we can appreciate the vulcans our distant brothers i have heard of vulcan integrity and personal honour theresa well known saying or is it a myth that vulcans are incapable of lying\nthen tell me truthfully now by your honour as a vulcan what was your mission\nit is unworthy of a vulcan to resort to subterfuge\nthen there is a truth here that remains unspoken\nthere is mister spock sun spoken truth you knew of the cloaking device that we have developed you deliberately violated romulan space with a blatant spy mission by order of the federation\nwe have not even begun theres no force that i can use on a vulcan that will make him speak that is a fact but there are romulan methods completely effective against humans and human weaknesses\nthen they will leave him dead or what might be worse than dead but i will know your unspoken truths\nattention enterprise i am speaking to you from the romulan flagship\nthe enterprise under command of captain james t kirk is formally charged with espionage the testimony of first officer\nspock was highly instrumental in confirming this intrusion into romulan space was not an accident first officer spock s testimony was specific that your ship was not under orders from starfleet command or the federation council to perform such a spy mission\nit was captain kirk who was solely responsible since the crew had no choice but to obey orders the crew will not be held responsible therefore i am ordering engineer scott presently in command of the enterprise to follow the romulan flagship\nto our home base you will there be processed and released to federation command until judgment is passed captain kirk will be held in confinement\nyou humans make a brave noise there are ways to convince you of your errors\ntake him to the security room\na vulcan among humans living working with them i would think the situation would be intolerable to you\nto whom is your allegiance then do you call yourself terran or vulcan\nhow long have you been a starfleet officer spock\nand you serve captain kirk do you like him do you like your shipmates\npossibly but you are subordinate to captain kirks orders even to his whims\nyou are a superior being why do you not command\nor is it that no one has offered you a vulcan that opportunity\nfor someone with your capabilities and accomplishments opportunities are made and will be i will see to that if you ll stop looking on the federation as the whole universe it is not you know\nyou must have your own ship\nof course it would be a great achievement for me to bring home the enterprise intact it would broaden the scope of my powers greatly it would be the achievement of a lifetime and it would open equal opportunities for you\nyes ill come there attend me\ni neglected to mention ill expect you for dinner we have much to discuss\nallow me to rephrase will you join me for dinner\nmister spock that corridor is forbidden to all but loyal romulans\ni hope that one day there will be no need for you to observe any restrictions\nare you the doctor\ncaptain kirks condition\nthen by your own standards of normality this man is not fully competent\nmister spock has stated that he believes the captain had no authority or order to cross the neutral zone could this mental incapacity have afflicted him earlier\nmister spock the doctor has now confirmed your testimony as to the mental state of your captain he was and is unfit to continue in command of the enterprise that duty has fallen on you are you ready to exercise that function\nthats enough doctor as a physician your duty is to save lives mister spock s duty is to lead the enterprise and its crew

alternative we will find a place for you if you wish it\nwith me romulan women are not like vulcan females we are not dedicated to pure logic and the sterility of non emotion our people are warriors often savage but we are also many other pleasant things\nas a vulcan you would study it as a human you would find ways to appreciate it\ni am so glad now one final step to make the occasion complete you will lead a small party of romulans aboard the enterprise and there you will take your rightful place as its commander and you will lead the ship to a romulan port with my flagship at its side\nyes yes it will mister spock you do know i have a first name\nwell i do would you like to hear it\nif you will give me a moment the soldier will transform herself into a woman\nis my attire now

your station sub commander the boarding action on the enterprise will begin with my command if they resist destroy her\nexecution of state criminals is both painful and unpleasant i believe the details are unnecessary the sentence will be carried out immediately after the charges have been recorded\nyou understand romulan tradition well the right is granted\nit should take less time than that to find you rally who stole the cloaking device you will not die alone recording the romulan right of statement proceed commander spock\neveryone carries out his duty you state the obvious

youll gain nothing\nmy first officer commander spock\nyou understand that starfleet command has been advised of the situation\nthe design of the ship is the same mister spock you said you had a theory on why your sensors didnt pick up the new ships until they were upon us\nif so romulans could attack in federation territory before we knew they were there before a vessel or planet could get even begin to get their defences up\nwell thats a brilliant observation mister scott do you have any other helpful opinions\nwe have three we can fight and be destroyed or we can destroy the enterprise

for discussion\nwhat did you do what did you do\nyour instincts are still good mister spock the captain is dead\ni left orders that no one come in here\nwell now that you know it you might as well assist me hand me the physio stimulator\nspock gave him a nerve pinch to simulate death\ni didnt know it until i beamed aboard the romulan ship jim and spock were operating under federation orders\nthats the vulcan death grip for you\nyou took a big chance they didnt start an autopsy\nso that if anything went wrong you would be the one to blame\nwhat for\nsickbay to bridge\nmister scott will you report to sickbay\nyou have to its urgent\nwell i do mister scott please\nwhat the devil is spock doing what s delaying him\nyour e taking an awful chance jim\nsickbay to bridge\nwell if all the shouting s over up there id like for you to report to sickbay\nwell youre due in surgery im going to bob your ears\nwell are you coming jim\nor do you want to go through life looking like your first officer\nsub commander talim receiving an alien transmission from within our vessel sir\nyes sub commander\ntriangulating now sir\nsub commander the enemy vessel is moving away at extreme speed

order come through\nfrom starfleet the order to enter the neutral zone\nsurely the captain couldnt be doing this on his own authority\nthats a klingon ship but it couldnt be not in this area\nthey caught us right enough\nweve not got many choices\nif the enterprise is taken by romulans theyll know everything there is to know about a starship\nperfectly clear\nsecurity put our two romulan hostages in the brig lieutenant uhura give me a channel to that ship\nthis is lieutenant commander scott the enterprise takes no orders except those of captain\nkirk and we will stay right here until he returns and if you make any attempt to board or commandeer the enterprise it will be blown to bits along with as many of you as we can take with us\nscott here doctor\nsickbay i cant leave the bridge at a time like this\nwere surrounded by enemy vessels ready to attack us i dont know of anything more urgent than that\nall right doctor it better be important scott out\nall right doctor whats so urgent that captain captain kirk\nwell you look like the devil himself but as long as your e alive whats it all about\ntheyre in the brig sir\naye sir no doubt of it\nbut mister spock hasnt sent the proper coordinates yet\nbut sir what about mister spock\nit ll have to hook into our deflector shield control\ni dont know sir\nive got that device installed but bless me if i know whether it ll work\nits the biggest guess ive ever made\ni did sir\nits not working\ncaptain im working as fast as i can\nits ready now captain but i dont know whether our circuits can handle this alien contraption\nitll likely overload\ni did give a full report\nsensors can to one half parsec negative captain\nincreasing sensors can to one parse call scanners report clear nothing in our immediate vicinity\nintelligence reports romulans now using klingon design\na second ship has appeared correction there are now three we are surrounded\ni have a theory captain\ntrue captain that would be standard romulan procedure\nit would be a great prize\ni believe the romulans have developed a cloaking device which renders our tracking sensors useless\nif we had not crossed the neutral zone on your order you would not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have had to be made\nspock\ni understand\nstarfleet is not in the habit of informing romulans of its ships personnel\nit is no myth\ni reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not violate my honour as a vulcan\nyour e being clever commander that is unworthy of a romulan it is not a lie to keep the truth to oneself\nyou would not resort to them commander they would prove in effective against the captain\ni can not allow the captain to be further destroyed the strain of command has worn heavily upon him hes not been himself for several weeks\nas you can see captain kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional person i believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision\nim betraying no secrets the commanders suspicion that starfleet ordered the enterprise into the neutral zone is unacceptable our rapid capture demonstrates its fool hardiness\ni am speaking the truth for the benefit of the enterprise and the federation i say now and for the record that captain kirk ordered the enterprise across the neutral zone on his own initiative and his craving for glory\nhe is not sane\ni am half vulcan my mother is a human\nvulcan\neighteen years\nthe question is irrelevant\nmy duty as an officer is to obey him\ni do not desire a ship of my own\nsuch opportunities are extremely rare\nthat thought has occasionally crossed my mind\ncommander shall we speak plainly it is you who desperately need a ship you want the enterprise\nindeed\ni am honoured commander are the guards also invited\nof course is hall obey your restrictions\nit would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain stable\ni am ready\nthe matter is not open for discussion doctor\nthere is no alternative doctor the safety of the crew is now the paramount issue it is misguided loyalty to resist any further\ni was unprepared for his attack i instinctively used the vulcan death grip\ni am very flattered commander theres no doubt that the cuisine aboard your vessel is far superior to that of the enterprise it is indeed a very powerful recruiting inducement\na place\ni was not aware of that aspect of romulan society\nplease believe mei do appreciate it\nyes of course but not just this moment an hour from now will do even better would it not commander\ni was beginning to wonder\nhow rare and how beautiful but so incongruous when spoken by a soldier\nspock to captain kirk\ncaptain\nare you prepared to beam over\nyes captain the cloaking device is in an area near the commanders quarters it is closely guarded and off limits to all but authorised personnel what is your present location\nunknown captain at present i am rather heavily\ncommander your attire is not only more appropriate it should actually stimulate our conversation\ni must confess that i too am moved emotionally i know it is illogical\nthat will be profitless commander i do not believe you will find it\ni assure you i am quite sane\nfirst officer of the enterprise what is your present form of execution captains log stardate 50274 commander scott has less than fifteen minutes to install the romulans cloaking device and get it working i hope mister spock can buy us the time we need\ni demand the right of statement first\nthankyou i shall not require much time no more than twenty minutes i should say\nmy crime is sabotage i freely admit my guilt the oath is wore as a starfleet officer is both specific and binding as long as iwear the uniform my duty is to protect the security of the federation clearly your new cloaking device is a threat to that security i carried out my duty\nthere is no regulation regarding the content of my statement may i continue\nbeyond the historic tradition of vulcan loyalty there is also the combined romulan vulcan history of obedience to duty\none hundred and fifty thousand kilometres captain and closing very rapidly\none hundred thousand kilometres they should commence firing at us within the next twelve points even seconds\nthe cloaking device is working perfectly and the commander has informed me that even the romulan sensors can not track a vessel so equipped\ndeck two it is regrettable that you were made an unwilling passenger it was not intentional all the federation wanted was the cloaking device\nit was my only interest when i boarded your vessel\nyou underestimate yourself commander\nobviously military secrets are the most fleeting of all i hope that you and i exchanged something more permanent\nit was the only choice possible you would not respect any other\ncaptain please go somehow they do not look aesthetically agreeable\non humans\nmaintaining course and speed sir\nbut sir that ll lead us directly into the romulan neutral

is certain we will be open to communication should you wish it\nthe subspace message will take three weeks to reach starfleet the decision is yours captain one hour\nmy commander wishes to speak with

would evolve similarly to earth in any way\nan alien metal of some kind an alloy resistant to probe readings cant even measure its age accurately these incised symbols are fascinating evidently some form of writing\nnegative captain structures of this complexity require extremely sophisticated building apparatus the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equalling our own\nbearing one ones even mark four\nif we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course with this planet we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes every second we delay arriving at the deflection point compounds the problem perhaps past solution\nyes sir\nthey are doctor a mixture of navajo mohican and delaware i believe all among the more advanced and peaceful tribes\nhighly improbable captain sensor probes indicate only one type of life form here\ntoo primitive to grasp the concept of space flight doctor our appearance here would only confuse and frighten them\ndoctor\ni suggest that any further research on your part be delayed until after we have diverted the asteroid\nspock to enterprise\nprepare to be am us up mister scott were warping out of orbit\ndoctor that asteroid is almost as large as your earths moon far enough away the angle necessary to divert it enough to avoid destruction is minute but as the asteroid approaches this planet the angle becomes so great that even the power of a starship\nif we arrive at the deflection point in time it may not get here at all\nonce the asteroid has been diverted well return here and resume the search\ndoctor assume this is the planet were on this is the approaching asteroid if we dont get to that deflection point in time it will become physically impossible to divert this asteroid in that case everyone on this planet will die including the captain\nin the time its taken me to explain the problem the asteroid has moved from here to here the longer we delay the less the likelihood of being able to divert it beam us up

barely four hours to effect rescue i believe those symbols are the key\ni am not hungry doctor and under stress we vulcans can do without sleep for weeks\nmy physical condition is not important doctor that obelisk is\nyou prescribed rest doctor the symbols on the obelisk are not words they are musical notes\nin away yes other cultures among them certain vulcan offshoots use musical notes as words the tones correspond roughly to an alphabet\nyes the obelisk is a marker just as i thought it was left by a super race known as the preservers they passed through the galaxy rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and seeding them so to speak where they could live and grow\nso have i apparently the preservers account for a number of them\nwhich has now become

make us invincible no one will tell us where to go when to sleep where to eat the universe will be mine to command yours to play in to accomplish this great mission we must first control the enterprise to control the ship we first must control the crew you know how to do that that is your next task and as you believe so shall you do so shall you do as you believe so shall you do so shall you do as you believe so shall you do so shall you do\nfriends we have reached a moment of crisis the enemy have discovered our operation but they are too late they no longer control the ship we do we shall prevail they will take us any place we desire go back to your stations maintain your controls if resistance mounts call upon their beast their beast will serve us well the fear in each one of them is the beast which will consume him remember how it was on triac us if they resist so shall it be on the enterprise if you need me call and i will appear our new goal is marcos twelve it is our new beginning we must not falter\nfoolish you will be destroyed i would ask you to join me but you are gentle and that is a grave weakness\nyeah\nprofessor starnes its kirk\nhe didnt seem to know me\nself inflicted\nall this self inflicted mass suicide\nkirk of the starship enterprise\nno sign of grief\nor of fear\nand you insist their behaviour indicates traumatic shock\na child suppresses the fact that both parents are dead i cant believe it\nnot these children to this extent its incredible\nill be guided by that opinion doctor for the present what about questioning them\naccepted doctor\ncareful\nchildren children listen to me its late and its time to go up to the ship\nim sorry im sorry youll go up with the doctor\nwhatever happened here is locked up inside those children\nattack mass suicide is what it seems to be\nsuch as\nwhat would make the children immune\nthen the children would have been exempted by conscious design\nand their present behaviour explained by a fear of punishment\nan attack by an unknown assailant on an uninhabited planet this planet is uninhabited mister spock to the best of our information\ngetting a reading\npicking up any life forms mister spock\noh thats strange thats very strange im getting a feeling of anxiety in this place it doesnt sound very scientific does it but its strongest right here\nmay be thats what s registering on your tricorder\nno of course thats thats me that sme but whats causing your tricorder to react\nyes im fine im fine just some sympathetic vibration with what happened here lets get back to the ship i want to check out those tapes from professor starnes tricorder and i am going to question those children\nthere has to be an answer\nwere not leaving here until we find out what went on or whats going on\nit could be far worse for them if i dont and for us too\nwell well well youre all having such a good time i think ill join you is that all right\nill have a dish too\na little one a very small one its better than triac us isnt it\ni dont think your parents liked it very much either\nim sure your parents loved you thats why they took you with them to triac us so they wouldnt be so far away from you for such a long time that would make them very unhappy and miss you im sure that you would miss them too\nnow wait a minute\nno i dont think so itll spoil your dinner\nall right children youve had a busy day i think you could use some rest nurse chapel will see you to your quarters\ntommy just a moment id like to ask you a question come and sit down tommy will you tell me what you saw\nin the cave on the planet on triac us\ndid you see your father today\ndid he seem upset\nwhat about\nwhat was going on that would have upset him\nim not upset with you tommy or your friends we invited you aboard the enterprise why would i do that if i didnt like you\narent you unhappy about leaving triac us\narent you upset about leaving your parents\nyes certainly ill take you\nkirk to security post a guard on the children theyre to be kept under constant watch\nlieutenant uhura any report from the planet security team\ngood\nlets see them\nlets see some more of these unscientific hypotheses mister spock\nwhat happened\ni didnt see you come in tommy\nno well probably take you to a federation starbase\nim sorry tommy marcos twelve is not within our patrol area mister spock well pursue this in my quarters\nall right tommy lieutenant have doctor mccoy report to my quarters for a brief conference mister leslie\nthat could be what destroyed him\nmisleading the innocent i wonder\nyes doctor spock what do we know about the race that lived here\nis that the end of it\nis it possible that the evil found the catalyst\nbut most legends have their basis in fact spock\ni understand your diagnosis doctor and ill respect it but not to the exclusion and safety of the enterprise thank you\nspock what other expeditions have visited triac us\nwhat was it professor starnes said about the unseen force\na ship yes a ship for triac us but why by whom security detachment ready for relief duty on triac us assemble in the transporter room immediately ill have some questions for that planet detachment as soon as they re beamed up i think its about time we found out whether professor starnes enemy within is on the planet below or here on board ship with us come on\nyour tour of duty will last one hour be prepared with your communicators at all times to report any alien beings dont wait to investigate beam down the guards\nbeam up the security detachment from triac us spock whats wrong\nwhy not\nthats impossible if were not orbiting triac us then the men i beamed down are dead\nactivate the bridge monitor screen\ncaptain to bridge\nmister sulu were not orbiting triac us\nyour e off course im coming right up\nsulu\nhelmsman disregard what you see on the screen what you think you see on the screen set a course for starbase four\nhelmsman did you hear me\nlieutenant uhura contact starbase four tell them were bringing the children there tell starfleet command i suspect them of being alien in nature and i want a thorough investigation made upon our arrival\nlieutenant what are you staring at\nlieutenant theres nothing there\nmister spock you make the call to starfleet mister sulu i ordered you to change course mister sulu\nmister sulu theres nothing there\nthat was an order spock\ncomplete\ntake a look around you\ntake mister sulu to his quarter she is relieved of duty\nconfine them to quarters did you hear me did you hear me\nyes we must im losing command im losing my ability to command im losing the enterprise\nim losing command im losing the enterprise the ship is sailing on andoni malone alone alone im losing command\nive lost command ive lost the enterprise\nive got command ive got command ive got command\nauxiliary control my vulcan friend this ship is off course\nscotty i want you to override the bridge navigation system and plot a course for starbase four\nwhy not\nscotty listen to me the enterprise has been invaded by alien beings its destination is marcos if we take it there millions will die the way they died at triac us\nno im all right spock my beast is finished it wont return\nspock theyre not the alien beings theyre children being misled\ntheyre children\nthey dont understand the evil that they redoing\nwell have to kill them captain kirk\nwhat is it ensign\nby whose order\nwhere did you hear this order ensign now listen to me this order is false i want you and your men to return to their stations\nensign listen to me\nensign listen to me this is a false order ensign\ni know that ensign you have never disobeyed an order but an alien being is a board this ship\nensign listen to me you will disobey this order starfleet command supersedes your order sir\nenough take these men to detention then join me on the bridge\nthe enterprise will never reach marcos twelve we will not be landing there\nthe crew does not understand when we make them understand as i understand they wont take you to marcos\nyour friend where is your friend where is that stowaway why does he hide\ngood im glad your e not afraid of me but your leader is afraid what she afraid of\nhes afraid to be seen and when the crew sees and hears him theyll understand that he is not their friend and they wont follow him\nthen let him show himself bring him out let him prove to me that he is my friend and ill follow him to marcos twelve and to the ends of the universe\nmister spock playback the chant the children sang to summon up the gorgan\nthe time has come to see the world as it is come on\ni did gorgan my beast is gone it lost its power in the light of reality i command again and i ordered you here\nand we know you\nnot if we join together to fight you\nwere also very strong\nchildren i have pictures of some of you on triac us id like to show them to you would you like to see them mister spock the pictures\nso we were told mister spock the pictures the children are waiting\nnot always gorgan not this time you cant hide from them they see you as we see you they know what you are even the children learn\ndont be afraid look at him without you children hes nothing the evil remains within him\nlook how ugly he really is look at him and dont be afraid\nits all right\nits all right mary its all right its all right isnt it doctor\nreverse course mister sulu\nset course for starbase four mister sulu\nwe have nt changed course\nwere still in orbit sir\ndont touch the controls sir\nwe must remain in this orbit till the bridge orders a change\ni will not disobey an order from the bridge\nyour e losing control of yourself\nyou missed me\ncome on play with us come on ring around the rosy pocket full of posy ashes ashes we all fall down ring around the rosy pocket full of posy ashes ashes we all fall down captains log supplementary we have buried the members of the starnes exploration party everyone has been deeply affected by what has happened here with some important exceptions\nlets go and play\nbut were just beginning to have fun\nthat was fun\nplease do\nyou werent there very long you dont know\nha thats what you think\nwatch out watch out ill sting you\nyeah\naw do we have to\nhe sees triac us on the screen\nwill we reach marcos twelve soon\nthey will they will\nhe will come if we call him\nhes not afraid of anybody\nhes dead captain\ncya lod in\nno jim no indication of any kind\nthey seem completely secure and unafraid\ni dont insist jim but i cant dismiss the possibility\nwhat those children saw is incredible jim the way those deaths occurred any reaction is possible including lacunar amnesia thats my diagnosis until specific tests can be made it remains that\nnot until the fabric of the trauma t isation weakens or you come up with another explanation for their behaviour forcing them to see this experience now could cause permanent damage\ncome on its time to be going\nthe tests show no evidence of tensions due to lying they behave as though nothing had gone wrong they checkout sound physically there are no signs of any foreign biochemical substances to account for their present state i have no answers jim\nwell cant it wait till we get to a starbase hospital so they can be checked out by child specialists\nwell i wont prevent you questioning them but it could harm the children if you do\nbe careful\nor by misleading the innocent\ndo you mean the children may be involved\ni think i read you jim but as medical officer i must warn you that unless the normal grief is tapped and released from these children you are treading dangerously\ntheyre crying jim i dont know how it happened but its good to see\nyes its all right we can help them now\nnot now\nwhats so good about that place\nwhen did we change course\nwhat do you mean we have nt changed course look at your bridge control monitor\nhave you gone completely blind thats not orbiting position\nwhat the devil do you think you redoing\nyou blind fool cant you see in front of you were not in orbit\nyou are disobeying an order from the bridge now step aside\nnot yet\ni cant do that sir\nthese are very sensitive instruments i will not have you upset their delicate balance we would all be lost forever lost go away now go away orwell kill you\nhumans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose and excluding that which is painful\nthe attack on professor starnes party must surely have been unprovoked\nist and corrected captain induced would be a more precise term induced by an outside force\nthe release of bacteria or a helpless mental depression and a state of suicidal anxiety could have been chemically induced\ni do not know but it is possible\na valid assumption i would say\nor the promise of reward\nat present yes odd\nthere seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave\ndefinitely not humanoid captain impossible to make any specific identification the readings do not correlate with any known information\nim not aware of it captain\ni am not familiar with anxiety but i wasnt aware it could be registered on sensors\nare you all right captain\ncaptain i have extracted the salient portion of professor starnes tapes\namong the technical fact she gathered professor starnes also offered some rather unscientific hypotheses\nthere is another portion captain which i believe you ll find particularly interesting\nunknown\nhe never completed the entry and the dispatch was never sent except for scenes of family life games and picnics with the children that is the complete record whatever overwhelmed them must have done so with incredible speed otherwise the professor would have provided details of the experience he was an excellent scientist and tireless in his pursuit of the truth\npossible captain evil does seek to maintain power by suppressing the truth\naccording to the legend triac us was the seat of a band of marauders who made constant war throughout the system of epsilon indi after many centuries the destroyers were themselves destroyed by those they had preyed upon\nno like so many legends this one too has a frightening ending it warns that the evil is awaiting a catalyst to set it again into motion and send it marauding across the galaxy\ni was speaking of a legend captain\naccording to federation records this is the first\nhe said an unseen force was influencing him that he recognised it was beginning to fight it and cancelled his request for a ship\ni am unable to lock onto the proper coordinates\nit appears we are no longer orbiting triac us\ncaptain we are no longer orbiting triac us\ncaptain why are we bothering starfleet\nthis bridge is under complete control\nthere is no need\ni can not obey your order captain\ncaptain we must get off this bridge\ncaptain\njim\ncorrect captain\nwhere to captain\ncaptain so long as the children are present there is danger they are the carriers\nthey are followers without followers evil can not spread\ncaptain the four hundred and thirty men and women onboard the enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children\nperhaps that is true but the evil that is within them is spreading fast and unless we can find a way to remove it\nyou take from those who do not know you\nwhy should you fear it\ntommys father would have destroyed you but he recognised you too late\nmust destroy ourselves alien upon us the enemy from within the enemy\nlogdate50253 ever since our arrival on triac us ive felt a certain growing feeling of uneasiness at first i attributed it to the usual case of nerves associated with any new project however ive found that the rest of my associates are also bothered by these anxieties the only ones not affected are the children bless them they find the whole thing an exciting adventure ah to be young again\n50324 the feeling of anxiety weve all been experiencing is growing worse\n50383 professor wilkins finished his excavation today although whatever civilisation that might have been here was destroyed by some natural catastrophe it would appear that one of the race took refuge in the cave and for our efforts we are becoming only more apprehensive as if some unseen force were influencing us\nim being influenced to do things that do not make sense i even went so far as to call starfleet command to request a spaceship to be used as a transport it was only when i couldnt tell them what i wanted to transport that i began to realise that my mind was being directed i decided to send a dispatch to starfleet warning them god forgive us must destroy ourselves alien upon us the enemy from within the enemy\ni did not\nits coconut and vanilla theyre both

medusa ns\nive heard mister spock that you turned down the assignment with the ambassador\nim sure the ambassador would be charmed\ni see in your mind that you are tempted to take my place\nyes that is why i had to study on vulcan\ni think ill stay here a bit ambassador kollo soften finds the process of transport somewhat unsettling\nwhat is it he sees when he looks at you i must know\nthey captain\nnow that you ask yes\nthank you captain\ni spent four years on vulcan studying their mental discipline\njoy can be many things doctor on vulcan i learned to do things impossible to learn anywhere else\nhow not to read them captain\nvulcan was necessary to my sanity\nindeed\nthe key is the mind link that i learned on vulcan once we have learned the technique of forming a corporate intelligence with the medusa ns the designers thats where larry comes in can work on adapting instruments\nhow can one so full of joy and the love of life as you doctor condemn yourself to look upon disease and suffering for the rest of your life can we allow that gentlemen\ntheres somebody nearby thinking of murder\nits gone now\nit isnt there anymore captain would you mind if i said

return it\nshall i tell you what human companionship means to me a struggle a defence against the emotions of others at times the emotions burst in on me hatred desire envy pity pity is the worst of all i agree with the vulcans violent emotion is a kind of insanity\nperhaps\nugly what is ugly who is to say whether kol los is too ugly to bear or too beautiful to bear\ni see your e a very complicated man\nkollo sno you must nt let him\nlet me go you have no idea what a dangerous thing spock is planning we must stop him let me go\nwhy ive already committed myself to mind link when kollo sandi reach the medusa n vessel why put yourself in jeopardy\nthen teach me to operate the ship i can memorise instantly\npity which i hate do you think you can gather more information with your eyes

keep it under control\nwelcome aboard ambassador kollo siam first officer spock\ncaptain kirk we are ready\ndoctor jones may i congratulate you on your assignment with ambassador kol los\nim sure you will find it a fascinating experience\nno one ever has i was referring to mind links i had attempted with members of other species\ni was unable to accept my life is here\nspock to bridge we have arrived at the ambassadors quarters\ni would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the ambassador\ni almost envy you your assignment\nnot correct doctor although i am aware of your mind attempting to contact mine were you born a telepath\ni understand may i show you to your quarters\ni understand our ships surgeon often makes the same complaint do call when you are ready\nwhy thank you captain\non the contrary doctor i would say that doctor jones was indeed fortunate\ndoctor jones was born a telepath captain\nwhat most humans generally find impossible to understand is the need to shut out the bedlam of other peoples thoughts and emotions\nas a matter of fact i wear it this evening to honour you doctor\ni see doctor mccoy you still subscribe to the outmoded notion promulgated by your ancient greeks that what is good must also be beautiful\nill escort you to your quarters\ni genuinely intended to honour her captain good evening gentlemen\ndo you know whether he saw the medusa n\nthen insanity will surely be the result captain dangerous insanity\ntrying captain mister chekov your assistance please\nwe are evidently far outside our own galaxy judging from the lack of traceable reference points when we exceeded warp speed factor nine point five we apparently entered a spacetime continuum\nimpossible to calculate we lack data to analyse our instruments appear to be functioning normally but what they tell us makes no sense our records are clear up to the point at which we left our galaxy\nunfortunately we lack reference points on which to plot a return course we experienced extreme sensory distortion and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed and we can not re cross the barrier using sub lightspeed\nan entertaining suggestion mister chekov but not very helpful kirk there is someone else aboard who might be able to help us navigate the medusa ns have developed interstellar navigation to a fine art could kol los function despite the sensory distortion\nvery possibly the medusa n sensory system is radically different from ours perhaps for the purpose of this emergency i might become kol los\na fusion a mind link to create a double entity each of us would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both we will function as one being\nif the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose separate identity a necessary risk of course doctor jones will not wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind link\ndoctor jones has shown reluctance every time ive asked to converse with kol los in some ways she is still most human captain particularly in the depth of her jealousy\nnot sufficient her telepathic powers are formidable if it is at all possible her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what i am doing shall intrude\nthe enterprise is at stake it is not possible for you to be involved\nthis is not a duty that you can assume i am aware of the fact that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine but theresa more important factor the object is to pilot this ship that is something you can not do\nfascinating\nevidently a highly sophisticated sensor web my compliments to you and to your dressmaker\nan elegant solution but i fail to understand why you apparently try to conceal your blindness doctor jones\nthis is delightful i know you all of you james kirk captain and friend for many years and leonard mccoy also of long acquaintance and uhura whose name means freedom she walks in beauty like the night\nare you surprised to find that ive read byron doctor\nin part

joking\nnot me mister earp\nwe dont want any trouble well be glad to cooperate\nwhat do you call that stuff fire\nlabel it for external use only\nand your reflexes were going to need fast reflexes from now on theres no negotiating with the ear ps we know that\ncould we make a communicator\nthe problem is clear spock were going to have to seek contemporary solutions wheres chekov\nmister chekov i mean billy come along\ngentlemen\nto exercise the better part of valour\nwell that settles that a force field\nmister chekov if you were in charge of the enterprise what would you be doing\nvery good if we could find the place where we beamed down the ship might lock in and beam us up\nit could be anywhere within a thousand mile radius\nwe have until five oclock to find that way now consider this what materials were on hand in 1881 that could help us fight the ear ps on their own terms\nno them elko ts gave us those to execute us we have to find a way to put the ear ps out of action is there anything that exists here and now that could help us out of this trap\nbones the venom the plants can you make use of them\nfirst bones the ingredients you require\nchekov mortar and pestle\nhow do you intend to deliver the tranquilli ser on target\ncotton wadding try the apothecary\nno\nyes we can\nscotty theyre trying to push us into something were not ready for\nmaybe he wouldnt be if i hadnt ignored the mel kot warning\nbut not this minute spock it takes us a little longer\nbones scotty\nabout what\nwilliam claiborne thats right\nyes yes thats right that means it doesnt have to happen the way it happened we can change it bone shows the tranquilli ser coming\nspock\nand well have a tranquilli ser grenade\nforget precision will it work\nmake sure it does spock if we dont tranquilli se them well have to fight them\nbut not with the earp sive tried that thats out there must be away history has been changed in the fact that billy claiborne didnt die but chekov is lying there dead that means there must be a way to change this history\nnot with the ear ps there is one other place i can try\nyes sheriff i want you to stop the fight\ni do now\nhow else is he going to get justice\nits not too late sheriff sheriff there must be plenty of decent people in town who dont like the ear ps lets organise them\nthen the people had better wake up and let the law work for them\nyes i want revenge i want to crush the life out of the ear ps but i cant just kill them\ncanti get it through your stupid head i cant just kill them i cant murder them\ni cant kill them i cant kill them\nhow soon will that be ready\ngood how long will it take the tranquilli ser to have effect\nhow did you manage to test it\nup to now everything has gone wrong i want it tested now\nit doesnt work\nit was our last chance\nwe need a weapon an answer\nten minutes and its all going to end at the ok corral well were going to wait right here until well after five oclock were not going to move from this spot\nlets get out of here\nscotty bones were trapped they got their way we ve got to stand and fight\ntheyre experts at gun fighting we dont have a chance\nspock you ve got something\nit would ve been effective anywhere else\nchekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him\nbut we do know that them elko tians created the situation if we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real they can not kill us\nwe must all be ascertain as you are mister spock to save our lives\nwe must spock a vulcan mind meld\nright here it seems\ndo you remember anything

claiborne stay away\nyou dont have to take anything from that scum not while im here\nimpossible doctor mccoy my transporter was working perfectly\nand these captain\nits impossible things like this cant happen\nabsolutely half a gallon of scotch\nit just takes a bit of getting used to captain actually a man could grow quite fond of this stuff\naye if we only had a phaser\nif we could only contact the enterprise\nwe have these captain\naye\ncaptain let me\ncaptain we cant just stand here and take it\nbut they murdered chekov if you think im going to\nmister spock chekov is dead i say it now and i can hardly believe it but you worked closely with him that deserves some memorial\nwould a volunteer solve the problem\nall right on one condition that im wide awake and with you at five oclock\naye its to kill the pain\nwell you should ve warned me sooner mister spock fire away\naye deeply\ni never felt better\ngood if they want a fight let sgi eem a fight\non mark eight and

whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with us\nindeed\nvulcan captain\nunquestionably most impressive\ntrue telepaths can be most formidable and we have been warned\nno recorded contacts if they ever ventured into space they evidently withdrew immediately\ni prefer being a welcomed guest captain but there seems to be little choice\nunknown captain sensor readings give no indication of fog like conditions in this area\nunknown captain unlike mister scotts transporter this unit is not functioning\nno use captain obviously none of our devices will function apparently that mel koti an

dangerous\ncaptain them elko t said you were the pattern he looked into your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place for our punishment\nyes the violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for our execution\nprecisely in terms of what them elko ts intend for us\nare they really\ncaptain i pride myself on my knowledge of your earth history the names were known in the annals of the opening of the western sector of america the united states of america that is\nand the clanton gang on october 26th they had it out\nhistory can not be changed\nis this a dead man doctor\ncaptain since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation i seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately without moving a muscle of either hand if i remember correctly that would involve you in what was called the fast draw it initiated unfortunate events\ni believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with mister chekov\ni assure you sir we shall watch it and everything extremely closely\nthe day is still young ensign\nand if this is indeed some sort of replay of history thee arps will kill the clanton sat the ok corral at five oclock this afternoon\nimpossible captain in this century there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours\nmister chekov is involved captain\nit is obvious them elko tians are not going to permit us to leave this town\ntheres no way we can know where it is doctor\ni could make a device to deliver it on target\nis hall need some fusing and cotton wadding\nis hall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister more familiarly known as a gas grenade\nand it is not yet our time\ngentlemen there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us specifically our future\ni understand the feeling captain\nmy feelings are not a subject for discussion doctor\ncaptain its quite all right they forget i am half human\ncaptain i vaguely remember the historical account of the famous battle in which we are about to engage but i am confused\nsince each of us represents members of the clanton gang you ike clanton i frank mc lowery then mister chekov would be the other billy would he not\nbut did not william claiborne survive the battle at the ok corral\nmister chekov is dead but in the actual gunfight william claiborne survived\nanother hour\nnot precisely\nit should\nnegotiating with them could buy us more time captain\nit would be worth a try at least until were certain of the device then perhaps we could quiet things down\nthese crude supplies we were forced to use worked quite well\nperhaps they would ve been if they d had your ingenuity doctor\ncaptain\nright now\nit has not been tested\nbut this is painless\nfascinating\ncaptain you dont seem to understand it did not function but it must function\na scientific fact but if the tranquilli ser does not function which is clearly impossible then a radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order\nthat may not be necessary\na fact captain physical laws simply can not be ignored existence can not be without them\ni mean doctor that we are faced with a staggering contradiction the tranquilli ser you created should have been effective\nexactly doctor in your opinion what killed mister chekov\nwrong his mind killed him\nphysical reality is consistent with universal laws where the laws do not operate there is no reality all of this is unreal\nbut you made your examination under conditions which we can not trust we judge reality by the response of our senses once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation we abide by its rules we judged the bullets to be solid the guns to be real therefore they can kill\nhe may indeed be dead we do not know\nexactly i know the bullets are unreal therefore they can not harm me\nprecisely\nthe smallest doubt would be enough to kill you\nvery well sir engineer\nyour mind to my mind your thoughts to my thoughts\nthe bullets are unreal without body they are illusions only shadows without substance they will not pass through your body for they do not exist\ncaptain\ncaptain the mel koti an object\nthe object is beginning to emit m rays of a highly unstable nature captain\nenergy output increasing beyond measurable levels captain\ncaptain may i ask a question you need nt answer if it seems too personal\nthis afternoon you wanted to kill didnt you\nbut he wanted to doctor\nyes captain\nmankind ready to kill\ni wonder how humanity managed to survive\nbilly oh billy billy baby i knew they

been incidents raids on our outposts\nwhat proof do we need we know what a klingon is\nthere those filthy butchers there are rules even in war you dont keep hacking at a man after he s down hand me that numan ol capsule\ntruce are you serious ive got men in sickbay some of them dying atrocities committed on their persons and you talk about making peace with these fiends if our backs were turned they d jump us in a minute and you know what klingons do to prisoners slave labour death planets experiments\nwhile your e talking theyre planning attacks this is a fight to the death wed better start trying to win it\nwho cares what started it mister spock were in it murderers we should wipe out every one of them\nhow many more men must die before you two begin to act like military men instead of fools\nbrainwaves show almost paranoid mania what happened\norderly jim johnsons heart wound is almost healed same with the other casualties sword wounds in the vital organs massive trauma shock theyre all healing at a fantastic rate\ngentlemen if we are pawns your e looking at one who is extremely sorry\nlets jump him\nyeah out already\nall others suspended in transit who are the guests by the way\nwell theyre right in here\ncaptain weve not been able to get through to starfleet command all subspace frequencies have been blocked and theres too much radiation coming from that klingon ship its a hazard to the vicinity\ntransporter room to bridge klingon ship is vacated sir\ni would if i could sir\nthe controls have gone crazy some things taken over\nthe engines sir\ntheyve gone to warp nine by themselves\nthree hundred and ninety two trapped below decks\nthe doors and bulkheads wont budge well have to cut through\nno sir she sa projectile at warp nine and dont ask me whats holding her together\nscott here sir theres no use trying to free those men down below the phaser torches they wont cut through the bulkheads nor the doors nor the decks theres something happened to the metal\nim there now sir and you never saw such a fine collection of antiques in your life\nayes ira claymore your ea beauty\nany signs of those devils mister sulu\ntheyve taken engineering i dont know how many more of those klingons are around but well split up here and try to make it back to the bridge\nsir chekov was right captain\nwe should have left those fuzz faced goons in the transporter thats right where they belong\nnonexistence now they can study the enterprise add our technology to theirs change the balance of power youve jeopardised the federation\nkeep your vulcan hands off me just keep away your feelings might be hurt you green blooded half breed\nthen transfer out freak\nbut this is war\nhave we forgotten how to defend ourselves\nwithout sensors all our power down this thing could go anywhere\nbut captain i didnt do it everything just came on by itself\nscotty sir\nthe ships dilithium crystals are deteriorating we cant stop the process\nin twelve minutes well be totally without engine power\ntheres no change captain the dilithium crystals are discharging\naye now thats something the klingons would understand\nits the alien thats done this were in its power our people and yours\ni wouldnt trust her captain\neven if it could work she may be leading you into a trap\nwell go with you\nbut she cant guarantee that kang will stop to listen right mister spock\nspock here captain\nsensors have picked up a klingon ship closing fast\ncaptain the enemy ship is drifting totally disabled\nand we never fired up on her\nhere captain\nunderstood captain transporter room\nour landing party is intact doctor\nfirst group from the klingon vessel captain\nat the moment we received the distress signal from the colony on beta twelve at he klingons were too far distant to have been the attackers moreover they also were apparently attracted by a distress call\nour log tapes will indicate our innocence in the present situation\nsensor sweeps reveal no other ships within range captain\ncaptain neither the klingon technology nor ours is capable of this the instantaneous transmutation of matter i doubt that they are responsible\nnone however if they had such power would they not have used it to create more effective weapons and only for themselves\nscans indicate that our forces and those of the klingons are exactly equal at thirty eight each the klingons control deck six and starboard decks even while we control all sections above\nmost curious captain there appear to be more life energy units on board than can be accounted for by the presence of the enterprise crew plus the klingons a considerable discrepancy\nis hall attempt a compensatory reading of klingon units\nno additional klingons detected captain it is an alien life force a single entity i can not ascertain its location\nreadings being diverted to the library computer for analysis computer report\nwhat purpose\nif the alien is creating these events captain it is apparently capable of manipulating matter and mind\ncaptain i am constrained to point out that since minds are evidently being influenced we can not know at this moment whether our own memories are completely accurate and true\nan appropriate choice of terms however it is notoriously difficult to arrange a truce with the klingons once blood has been drawn\nwe are attempting to end it doctor by reason preferably there is an alien on board which may have created this situation\neasy mister scott\nmay i say that i have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans i find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant\nfascinating the result of stress\nrecent events would seem to be directed toward a magnification of the basic hostilities between humans and klingons apparently it is by design that we fight we seem to be pawns\nit is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities\nsensors may be operating\nalien detected in the engineering section near reactor number three\njim hes not responsible\nit would appear that the entity wants us alive\nperhaps human and klingon psychologies and combat capabilities are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers\ni understand doctor i too felt a brief surge of racial bigotry most distasteful\ntotally unfamiliar\nfascinating during lieutenant johnsons emotional outburst his expression of hatred and lust for vengeance the aliens life energy level increased when the lieutenant became unconscious the alien lost energy\nthis one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of hostility violent intentions\nto put it simply and it has acted as a catalyst creating this situation in order to satisfy that need it has brought together opposing forces provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict\nthen all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated the fighting must end and soon\nthe alien is affecting his mind captain soon it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it\ntheres nothing we can do about it\nwe have nine minutes fifty three seconds to power zero\nthere is of course a logical alternative kang s wife is after all our prisoner perhaps a threat\neight minutes forty two seconds\nit has rarely been done because of the danger involved pinpoint accuracy is required if the transport ee should materialise inside a solid object a deck or wall\nno one can guarantee the actions of another\nyour automatic setting is laid in captain\nwhen transporter is energised you will have eight seconds to get to the pads\nyoull know in seven point nine seconds captain\nthose who hate and fight must stop themselves doctor otherwise it is not stopped\nall fighting must end captain to weaken the alien before our dilithium crystals are gone\nthe cessation of violence appears to have weakened it captain i suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon\ntrouble aboard the klingon ship evidence of explosions massive destruction\nforward phasers locked and ready to fire sir\nwarp factor three sir\nchange in course accelerating helm dead auxiliary navigation dead\nnothing responds captain\nnine oh two mark five\naye sir\nwhats chekov s grudge against the klingons whos piotr e\nhis brother he never had a brother he san only child\naye sir\nall clear mister scott\naye\ncaptain\naye captain\nno good captain\ncircuits are in but systems just a rent responding\naye captain power and life support restored remotes on standby\nstill no contact with starfleet command sir outside communications blanketed\nno contact with starfleet as yet sir\ncaptain this doesnt make sense carriers are normal channels are open theres still no outside contact i dont understand it sir could the klingons be doing something\ncaptain reports coming in from the lower decks emergency bulkheads have closed almost four hundred crewmen are trapped down there sir\ncaptain why would why would chekov believe he has a brother\nsickbay calling doctor there are more wounded men requiring your attention\nyes captain\naye sir\nready captain",

temper your judgment with intuitive insight i believe you have those qualities but if you cant find them in yourself seek out mccoy ask his advice and if you find it sound take it bones youve heard what ive just told spock help him if you can but remember he is the captain his decisions must be followed without question you might find that he is capable of human insight and human error they are

be correct we do not tolerate deceit\njim the captains neck is broken\nmccoy here\nid say these people killed each other\nyou heard correctly jim these people killed each other\naccording to the ships log the medical surgeon down here didnt even know what was going on\nthe best i can do is get all the readings i can get and analyse them later\nwhat the devil\njim this ship is dissolving my hand just passed through a man\nand a table\nwhat happened mister spock\ndid anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before this\ndid he seem to be getting hysterical\ntake mister chekov to sickbay put him under restraint\nthats what i was afraid of whatever it was that drove the crew of the defiant to murder each other could be communicable\ntime by the way mister spock i think it might be a wise precaution to put some distance between us and the defiant\nhow long will that take\nspock are you sure that jim is still alive\nif we could only find the proper filtering agent we might be able to solve this problem negative its the third failure\nnurse take this sample and run an analysis on it\nthank you nurse call security i want to have some checks run on this man\nmccoy to bridge\nhas the captain been beamed aboard yet\nwhen is that interphase going to happen\ni thought you had the thing timed out\nyou mean you dont know whether your e going to be able to recover the captain or not\nyou cant wait for the next one weve had another case like chekov\ni had to confine my orderly to sickbay\nthe disease is not transmitted by the men mister spock the cause is the area of space were in its affecting the whole crew\nthe molecular structure of the brain tissues in the central nervous system are distorting\nand the madness that affected the defiant screw will soon happen to the enterprise\nnow you ve got to get this ship out of here\nwhats the use of this battle spock youve lost jim take this ship out of here\nare you satisfied spock why did you do it\nyou should ve known what couldve happened and done everything in your power to safeguard your crew that is the mark of a starship captain like jim\nits still negative mister spock the ragen is the most promising substance tested so far were progressing\nmy staff is working around the clock my being there will not affect the biochemistry of any of the tests this service requires my personal attention mister spock\ntake him to sickbay put him in restraint\nthere is a duty to be performed in the captains quarters which requires our presence\nthe captain left a message tape it was his order that it be reviewed by both of us should he ever be declared dead you have just declared jim dead\nwhy are you afraid it ll change your present status\nthe captains last order is top priority and you will honour that order before you take over\nhe was a hero in every sense of the word yet his life was sacrificed for nothing the one thing that would have given his death meaning is the safety of the enterprise now youve made that impossible mister spock\nmaybe not the same one i really came here to find out why you stayed and fought\nyes he would mister spock but you didnt have that decision to make what would you gain by fighting the tho lians you could have assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area but you chose to stay why\nyou mean to be sure if he was dead well you made certain of that\nyes i have something to do if this crew is to survive i have to find an antidote to this space youve locked us into\ntheres no hurry mister spock the antidote probably doesn t concern you vulcans are probably immune so just take your time\ni must admit i dont understand you spock but i just cant believe that you would want jims command you must know that if you get us out of this situation they llp in a medal on your chest and give you command of the enterprise\ni would like to remedy that situation\nspock ier im sorry it does hurt doesnt it\nof course you have uhura we would all like to\nof course\nwere going to sickbay\nyes nurse\nyes its beginning to spread generally throughout the ship\nno except im positive that its at her age n derivative thats the answer and it better be the next one\nwell nobody saw him but you uhura\ni dont think so\nno no were working hard well find an antidote\nsounds like a horror story suppose there s any truth in it\ndo you suppose they re seeing jim because they ve lost confidence in you\nits getting critical there have been a number of assaults down on the lower decks even scotty s being affected if scotty goes under thats the finish of whatever chance we have of getting the enterprise out of here\nspock it must be this space its getting to me too i know its nothing youve done spock i im sorry\nyes uhura you refine\nit was real\nwe all saw him the captains still alive\nmccoy here\nill be right there\ncompliments of the house to your good health and the health of the crew\nyes an dive ordered it orally or intravenously for everyone aboard the ship i would like for you gentlemen to drink it down\nhes his smiling self again ive discharged him from sickbay\nits a diluted the ragen derivative\nthats right and in this derivative mixed with alcohol it merely dead ens certain nerve inputs to the brain\none good slug of this and you can hit a man with phaser stun and he d never feel it or even know it\nit should\nwell drink it down spock its the human thing to do thats a medical order captain\nmccoy here\nim ready mister spock\nwelcome home jim\noh we managed mister spock gave the orders and i found the answers\nhe means when humans become involved with vulcans jim\nwhat orders are you referring to jim\noh those orders well there was nt time we never had a chance to listen to them\nlocked in on the defiant bridge sir\ntransporter room oneil here\nno sir not yet\nim all right\nready mister spock\ncaptain were losing power in the warp engines\nwe can barely read it but i dont like the looks of it and i can not find out the cause\naye sir\nscott here sir\naye aye captain\naye aye captain standing by\naye i think your e right keep us within beaming range but not too close\nbridge to transporter room\nyou got that transporter working yet mister\ntake over mister sulu ill be in the transporter room\nscott here\ni cant sir at least not all at once\neverything that ship your ein is fading out and its ripping the innards out of this one\nits jamming our transporter frequencies ive only got three of them working and im not sure of those one of you has got to wait\naye\nanything\nthat sitive done all i can theres nothing out there to grab a hold of and bring in when that ship went it must have taken the captain with it\ntwo hours and twelve minutes that power leak has unbalanced the ship and shes starting to drift i cant hold her in place that long\nhe had no cause to be angry\ntransporter room here\nim trying captain kirk is not on his designated coordinates mister spock\nscott to bridge\ni know you dont like to use the phasers but you ve got to do something about that ship out there\nspock that hit from the tho lians has fused our power supply converters\ni cant do a thing with the enterprise now\nshes bound to drift may be right through that doorway out there\ni dont even know if she can be repaired\nattention dismissed\nmister spock we have a readout on the tho lian tractor field i think we can estimate its approximate completion time\nscott to captain\nscott to captain\none of our crewmen just went berserk but we have him under control for the moment\nwere beginning to interphase\nscott to bridge\nare we slipping into interspace\ni dont believe it\nmister spock\nive just seen captain kirk he was standing there as plain as we are\nand then he just disappeared\nmister spock look\nthen your fears about that phaser were correct it blasted a hole right through that crazy space fabric and only heaven knows where it sent the defiant\nthat ll be about twenty minutes aye shell be back together but well only have about eighty percent power built up\nwhat have you got there\nwhat is it\naye and deadly too what are you thinking of doc are you trying to kill us all\noh well any decent brand of scotch will do that\ndoes it make a good mix with scotch\nill let you know\nscott here\naye sir standing by\nshes only up to seventy six percent\ncaptain we are registering very curious readings from all sensors\ni can not according to our instruments space itself is literally breaking up there is no known phenomenon which would account for these readings\nnegative i have run a complete check on all systems\nfascinating\nthere is virtually no sensor contact no mass analysis no trace of radiation we see it but our sensors indicate it is not there\nabsolutely no record of such an occurrence ensign\nthe ship is still functioning captain it is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard\ncaptain there is no sign of life aboard this vessel\ncaptain the defiant s sensors correspond with an extremely high degree of correlation to those of the enterprise\naffirmative\nrequest permission to remain captain i could be completing the data\ncaptain there is a chance\nenergise\nnegative\ncompute the next period of spatial interphase\nwe must try mister scott the fabric of space is very weak here if we disturb it there will be no chance of retrieving the captain alive\nwell picture it this way mister chekov we exist in a universe which coexists with a multitude of others in the same physical space at certain brief periods of time an area of their space overlaps an area of ours that is a time of interphase during which we can connect with the defiant s universe\nyes however the dimensional structure of each universe is totally dissimilar any use of power disturbs it if we are not extremely careful we shall lose the captain and become trapped ourselves\nchekov chekov\nsecurity guards to the bridge\ni was attempting to explain to mister chekov the nature of our problems in this situation when he attacked\nlieutenant uhura is correct there was murderous fury in chekov the same fury which was evident in the defiant\nis there anything you need to isolate the cause\nif we are to recover the captain we must not move\napproximately two hours before the attempt can be made\nthe captain was caught in our transporter beam when the defiant phased out it is possible he was spared the shock of transition and survived however if we are to recover him we must catch him at the precise moment during the next interphase or he will die and there can be no margin for error his environmental unit can provide breathable air for no more than three point six two hours\nstatus mister sulu\nlieutenant uhura signal red alert\ntransfer to main viewer\nspock in command of the federation starship enterprise commander according to the federation this area is free space\nwe are not interested in your display of force

reappear in one hour and fifty three minutes we request you stand by until then\nbridge to transporter room\nready for interphase in twenty seconds\nlock onto captain kirks coordinates\nand prepare to bring him a board mister scott\nbring him a board mister scott\nwell keep trying mister scott\nlieutenant sulu evaluation\nits possible the tho lian entry into the area has disturbed the space and if that has occurred\nspock here\nnegative doctor\ntheoretically it already has happened doctor\nhowever the ships sensors are not responding as predicted\ni did doctor the space was disturbed by the tho lians\nnot at this interphase\ni shall have to recalculate to determine when the next interphase will occur they do not take place at regular intervals\ni have confidence that you will soon isolate the cause doctor and prevent further spread of the affliction\nthe renowned tho lian punctuality\nengineering hold power steady and cut off all unnecessary expenditures mister sulu divert all but

sulu\nfire\nengineering status report mister scott\ncan you estimate minimum time required for repair\nthe decision to fight was logical lack of time prevented any other course of action the tho lian ship had to be disabled\ndoctor i hardly believe this is the time for comparisons please go to your laboratory and search for an antidote to the effects of this space that is your primary task since we must remain here\nfascinating\nnegative lieutenant uhura can you open a channel to the approaching vessel\ndistance mister sulu\nmisters ului shall run an analysis on those filaments tie in all sensors to the ships library computer console switch scanners\ntheres no analogy to this structure in federation technology it is however an energy field and if the tho lians are successful in completing this structure before we have completed our repairs we shall not see home again\ndoctor your last report on an antidote on the effects of this space was negative\nthe urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory\na few hours ago the captain elected to remain on board the defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance of returning safely to the enterprise his concern was not only for them but for all the members of the crew of this ship you all know the sequence of events we were fired upon by the tho lian ship at that time captain kirk may have been alive i deemed it necessary to return the tho lian fire for the safety of the enterprise the tho lian ship has been disabled but as a result of the battle we must accept the fact that captain kirk is no longer alive\ni shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and admiration which captain kirk commanded each of you must evaluate the loss in the privacy of your own thoughts\nit can wait doctor my duties require my immediate presence on the bridge\nit will wait for a more suitable moment doctor\nthe mental and physical state of this crew are your responsibility doctor at the moment they are your top priority\nwe came here for a specific purpose doctor\nthe captain would have remained to recover a crew member at the risk of his own life or even his own ship\ni need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of this crew there is a margin of variation in any experiment while there was a chance i was bound legally and morally to ascertain the captains status\nthat is enough doctor we both have other things to do\nyou will return to your duty as soon as weve discharged our responsibilities here\ndoctor i am in command of the enterprise\nif you believe i have acted irregularly then relieve me of duty that is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship\nwhat would you have me say doctor\nspock here\ni shall be there shortly doctor i believe we each have our respective tasks to complete before the tho lians complete their s\nspock here proceed mister scott\nreport to doctor mccoy all symptoms noted prior to the attack\nspock

exactly what they wish to see\ni was merely stating a fact doctor\nplease leave that to me doctor mccoy i realise that the crew are your prime concern you can best serve them in your laboratory i urge you to confine yourself to it until a remedy has been found\ni understand doctor im sure the captain would simply have said forget it bones\ncaptain captain captain\nexactly but the captain remained

star trek web pages on this site are for educational and entertainment purposes only all other copyrights property of their respective holders\ni am whats the problem\nwell what happened to that leg\ni dont understand this should have been attended to immediately\nwell were certainly going to try the infection is massive let me give you a hypo to ease the pain\nin the arm\nill let you know when i have the results and from now on it would be better if i handled the instruments without your help\nneither do i but it has how do i knockout an infection when the tricorder doesnt show any information on platon i us bacteria all i can do and this is going to take time is to try to match his bugs with a known strain and hope\nwhat about medicine why no doctors\ni think id better wait until the fever breaks\njimmy concoction actually worked the fevers broken and what recuperative powers the infections begun to drain already\nhe may still need the ships medical stores why prevent contact\ni dont know i dont want to go but i cant help myself\nim very sorry but thats impossible\nthe answer is no\ni cant move jim theyre going to keep me here no matter what leave please\nyou wont persuade me\nstop it dont do this to him par men\nno par men stop it\ni have my orders\nand weve had too much of your sill never get me to stay here\nhesa vulcan you cant force emotion out of

others\nyou wont even know it happened\nof course par men possesses the highest order of psychokinetic ability and alexander the lowest in the same environmental conditions\nill run both their blood samples through for a full comparative test on the tricorder\nthe one significant difference between par mens blood and alexanders is a concentration of kiron ide broken down by pituitary hormone\nitll take some doing but it is possible\neven if the kiron ide reaches the desired effect it still may not help us get out of here\nim ready\nsince the kiron ides broken down and injected directly into his blood stream it should work on him as well as us better in fact because he s acclimated\ntheyll never do it jim\nstop it par men stop it ill do whatever you want me to do ill stay and serve you but stop it\ni suppose i scratched it\nsheer ignorance is there anything you can do\nwhere\nwhat is it what is your prognosis doctor\npar men will do philosopher kings have no need of

that i myself realised i am sure that you too have been out of sorts and have been driven to fits of temper and rage unlike you however what i think and feel whether for good or ill is instantly translated into reality so please find it in your heart to forgive me\nit will be shortly\nnot at all but there is one final request after my nearly fatal infection it has become obvious to us all that we can not afford to be without a skilled physician therefore we should like you doctor mccoy to remain\nyour duties will be extraordinarily light youll be free to read meditate conduct research

mister spock i admit that circumstances have forced us to make a few adaptations of plato but ours is the most democratic society conceivable anyone can at any moment be or do anything he wishes even to becoming ruler of platon i us if his mind is strong enough\noh come now we are not children in your culture justice is the will of the stronger it is forced upon people by means of weapons and

in command captain\nno my dear that might offend the good doctor you wish to stay by all means you can help us celebrate our anniversary in the process i hope we can persuade you to join our tiny republic\ni think we will\nwell doctor\nas you wish doctor\nweve had enough or your moralising\nyou will be happy to stay it takes a little time doctor but you will be happy to stay\nwe cant let him die laughing can we\nhow can you let this go on\nfellow academicians twenty five hundred years ago a band of hearty vagabonds arrived on this barren rough hewn planet there was a desperate hardship of backbreaking to il and then a divine providence graced our genius and our dedication with the power of powers and through it our every need instantly materialised we thereupon determined to form a utopian brotherhood this night is indeed a festive occasion for tonight we welcome into that brotherhood its first new member\ndoctor please you have destroyed the festive mood of the ladies we must recapture it at once i know what would be better than a serenade from the laughing spaceman\nand now let the revels begin\nyou are so impatient my wife observe the doctor and learn hes quite content to wait for the piece de resistance\nalexander again he likes to play with knives very well we shall indulge him\nwho did that\nnot twice mine\ncaptain no captain i beg of you ill do anything you say i do not wish to die captain do you hear me\ncaptain you knew that i intended to destroy both you and the enterprise yet you spared me\ntheres no need for concern they ll be safe of late i have begun to think that weve become bizarre and unproductive we are existing merely to nourish our own power its time for some fresh air we shall welcome your interstellar visits\nunderstood captain and your e right none of us can be trusted uncontrolled power will turn even saints into savages and we can all be counted upon to live down to our lowest impulses\nwelcome to our republic whom among you is the physician\nmy spouse his leg come this way\nalexander you talk too much captains log stardate 57843 doctor mccoy is endeavouring to treat the leader of a strange group of people when their planet nova ed millennia ago they transported themselves to earth in the time of socrates and plato after the death of the greek civilisation they idol is ed they came to this planet and created for themselves autopia patterned after it\ntwo and a half ever since our arrival here on platon i us\nbrainwaves\nno not if they re embedded in the unconscious\nwe have nt had any pressing need for the medical arts you see while still on sahn dara we instituted a mass eugenics programme were the result pared down to a population of thirty eight were perfect for our utopia were bred for contemplation and self reliance and longevity how old would you say i am dont be afraid im not vain\nthat old i stopped aging at thirty well anyway your e off by two thousand years im two thousand three hundred years old we were married very young i was only a hundred and seventeen and he was a hundred and twenty eight so you see we scarcely have to move anymore let alone work\nthats right a break in the skin or a cut can be fatal\nnow doctor\ni dont know how i can ever thank you not only for platon i us but for myself\nalexander show our guests to the southwing\ngentle spacemen we are eternally in your debt weve some trifles for you please accept them as tokens of our gratitude they stem from the very source of our inspiration to our noble captain the shield carried by pericles as a symbol of gallant leadership\nto our silent and cerebral mister spock this kit hara to pluck music to soothe his ever active brow\nand lastly to the physician doctor mccoy who saved platon i us and my spouse this ancient collection of greek cures penned by hippocrates himself\nwhy even discuss it get rid of them\nyou must be joking doctor\npar men lets get on with it\npar men\nwhats going on\nscott to captain kirk\ncaptain were in the midst of a storm\nno discernible cause an dive never seen anything like it theres\nten scale turbulence right now emergency gyros and stabilisers at maximum\nif this keeps up captain we cant last\nive tried that sir shes locked tight\nright captain\nscott on the enterprise\nits all right captain the turbulence has abated\naye captain\nscott here sir\nim afraid i cant do that sir everythings frozen\nits not the turbulence sir damage to the ship is minimal\ni dont know sir and those are the facts\nno sir the orbits locked tighter than ever\nand subspace communication with starfleet its completely severed\nhow is the power transmitted\ndo these waves cease while you are asleep\nthirty five\nfascinating i believe were experiencing the psychokinetic manifestations of par mens delirium\nhow does one obtain the power\ncaptain it will be very gratifying to leave here\neven if he shouldnt\ndoctor mccoy you may yet cure the common cold\nobviously par men does not wish any contact made with the enterprise\nto shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a starfleet captain\nagreed captain and par men wouldnt have treated you so brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the enterprise\nwhose harmony yours plato wanted truth and beauty and above all justice\ntwo spacemen marching to a drum\nwes lith among them imseytovesandgyre among the boro gove s\ni trust they did not injure you too much captain\nthe humiliation must have been most difficult for you to bear i can understand\nthat may be doctor however i have noted that the healthy release of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to you\nso it would seem captain\ndo you still feel anger toward par men\nand you doctor\nthen you must release it gentlemen asi must master mine i might have seriously injured you captain even killed you they have evoked such great hatred in mei can not allow it to go further i must master iti must control\nalexander it is possible for you to recall how long after you arrived here that that power began to develop\nand would you know how many months supplies you brought with you\nthats close enough alexander fascinating their power developed two or three months after they started eating the native foods\nthen it is logical to assume that there is a connection between the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods\nperhaps his system can not absorb the crucial element\nthe probabilities are that alexander was born with some biochemical deficiency relative to platon i us\nthe pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis they also regulate body growth\nyes its also obvious why par men kept this little utopia secret anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire the power\nthe point is well taken however the psychokinetic power is not additive if it were considering the platon ians hostile propensities two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and deposed par men\nthe time factor concerns me it may take days or even weeks before the res enough build up from the kiron ide to be of any benefit to us\ni have experienced a slight flush captain\ntake care young ladies and value your wine be watchful of young men in their velvet prime deeply theyll swallow from your finest kegs then swiftly be gone leaving bitter dregs ah bitter dregs with smiling words and tender touchman offers little and asks for so much he loves in the breathless excitement of night then leaves with your treasure in cold morning light ah in cold morning light\nwe have tried\ni havent the power im deeply sorry weve failed you\nquite possible and logical\nthat would be highly uncharacteristic we must expect par men that the moment we leave here your fear would be gone and you would again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years have made you\nwe were forced in the transporter and beamed down it was like becoming someones puppet\nim so frightened captain im so very frightened\ni know it but i wish i could stop trembling\nim thinking im thinking of all the times on the enterprise when i was scared to death and i would see you so busy at your commands and i would hear your voice from all the parts of the ship and my fears would fade and now they are making me tremble but im not afraid i am not afraid",

you so you are like me now your crew can not see you or any of us because of the acceleration we move in the wink of an eye oh there is a scientific explanation for it but all that really matters is that you can see me and talk to me and we can go on from there\nbecause i like you didnt you guess or are you so accustomed to being kissed by invisible women\noh but it has not been sabotaged we we had to make some changes in it to adjust it to us\nyes of course my chief scientist and his crew i am their queen you are going to be their king youll enjoy living on sca los\noh in a few of their moments they will realise that youve vanished they will look for you but they will not find you youre accelerated far beyond their power to see so they ll go on without you dont be so stubborn you can not go back to them ever is it so dreadful a prospect\nbut that wont work you go ahead and try point it right at me\nmy reactions are much too fast for such a crude weapon and i am quite good at self

they hear this it will be too late you have remarkable reasoning powers captain you were quite right in almost every assumption\ndo you really want to know in a little while it wont matter to you at all youll be quite happy about it just as compton was\noh dear you are so stubborn it should be obvious to you that were doing it because we have to a long time ago it is in our history we used to be like you then our country was almost destroyed by volcanic eruptions the water was polluted radiation was released that changed us it accelerated us the children died most of the women found they could not have more all of our men had become sterile so we had to mate outside our own people whenever a spaceship came by wed send our calls for help but accelerating them to our level burned them out dont you see captain do i have to go into every detail we are going to take you down with us perhaps one or two others of your crew we have to well be kind to you i wouldnt hurt you certainly i do like you\ntheyll remain herein suspended animation it will do them no harm we are saving them for when we need them in the future you will not last forever you know that captain captain we have the

too late\nrael\nrael stop\nnow stop it did he damage you captain\nhow very fortunate for your ael dont you dare do anything like that again its contemptible\ni dont care what your feelings are i dont want to know that aspect of it what i do is necessary and you have no right to question it allow me the dignity of liking the mani select is the transporter repaired\ndont you think you d better do it\nhe loves me i adored him when i was a child i suppose i still do i must say you behaved better than he did\nwhat did you say\nand nothing bothers you now\nour leaving was delayed dont you remember you damaged the transporter\nyes it certainly was\ndo you want to\nwhat about your crew arent you worried about them\noh\nnothing youve completely accepted the situation havent you you even like it\nno i liked you better before stubborn and irritating and independent like rael\nmay be thats why i liked you so much because you were like him rael you dont have to worry about the captain hes made the adjustment\nis it repaired already\nwhy didnt you tell me\nwhere will you be\nrael wait im sorry\nwellcome captain its time to leave your pretty ship\nyour crew will be all right you said so

not depend on that\ndont make a game of it captain weve lost\nthere wont be any others youll warn them your federation will quarantine the entire area\nand we will die and solve your problem that way

alert while we continue the investigation\nscotty assist\nmister spock ever since we beamed up from sca los weve had a series of malfunctions i want an investigation and an explanation\ncant it wait bones\nwhat do you read so far\non my way mister spock you have the conn\nwhat is it\nanything missing\nthank you\nthat fits in with other disturbances bones what did your readings show upon the other men\nany of them report any unusual experience since beaming\nhold on bones could something be making me hallucinate\ni mean that twice before something touched me and there was nothing there and its just happened again could ibe imagining it\nbut ami hallucinating\nthen we did beam something aboard something has invaded the ship kirk to spock come in spock come in\nspock i cant hear you check your circuits is there a malfunction\nlieutenant ship wide order use communicators instead of intercom issue phasers to all crew members spock repeat\nmeet me there on the double\nspock\nphasers on stun sweep the area\nwhat is it\nhooked into the life support designed to affect it\ndisconnect it destroy it\nthat was no force field something shoved me back theyre in here you what are you doing on my ships how yourselves\na show of strength\nhave your readings been fed into the computer\nreadout\nwe will not negotiate do you concur\nmister spock\nyeoman is that coffee available or have those circuits been damaged as well my recommendation make them take the next step then everything around him slows down and finally stops\nspock\nwould you mind explaining who are you\nyour e the enemy\nwhat have you done with my men\nnothing mister spock scotty this is nothing\nlieutenant sulu this is nothing\nwhat have you done\nwhy\ndee la is this why you sabotaged my ship\nyou said we\nwhat about my ship my crew\nthis wont kill you but the stun effect is not very pleasant\nif i agree to go with you will you set this ship to rights take out that device in the life support system\ncompton did they accelerate you\nthey hooked something into the life support system theyre in there we ve got to get rid of it\nby whose order\nim your commander compton i order you to let me in\nwho is dee la is that who you reworking for\nall right compton\nwhat is that device doing on my ship\napprove of it were your prisoners\nhe was so young\nthis is what you have planned for us\nkirk to spock i have fed all the ascertainable facts into the computer banks\nhyper acceleration is the key i have counted only five of them aboard but they have taken over the ship and we are under their control due to this acceleration they are able to speed others up to their level as they did compton and me presumably this is enslavement those so treated exist at this accelerated level becoming docile eventually but when\ndamaged they age incredibly fast as though accelerated living\nburns them out compton was burned out the device attached to the life support system produces an extreme numbing cold it is my belief that they are turning the enterprise into a gigantic deep freeze for purposes only the sca los ians know\nthe unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact i dont know how to destroy it but its destruction is imperative\nwhy are you doing this\ni really want to know\nwhat about the rest of my crew\nnot by killing others\nyou invaded my ship you threaten my crew\nthere is a difference your trouble is in you\ndid they solve anything have you tried any other way dee la have your scientists disconnect destroy that unit i promise you well use every skill we have to help you well move you to another planet well call on the most brilliant minds in our federation to help well do it\ni panicked\nid like to leave before he activates the suspended animation device\nit was working before try it again\nthe technicians reported a loss of power that must be it\nyes of course\ni believe in honest relationships myself\na room should reflect its occupant\nwell if she s pretty enough ill look\na bit\nbut now\nwas it oo crude\nyes i know\nwhat happened\nthere is an insect life\nmy ears register it\nthis device attached to the life

for it is that what happened to linke and oz aba\nwell what did you expect from them and what do you want from me\nwhy what is it you hope to prove if my death is to have any meaning at least tell me what im dying for\nwill she live\ncan you explain what happened\nshe weakened i could feel it is her life in danger\ncould the strain really have killed her\nim tired\ni remember the laboratory and they wanted to know something but ii cant remember\nwhats the matter with me\nyoull have to ask the via ns willi live\nno hes right continue\ncan you tap into it\nand get us out of here the same way we were brought in\nthen i would say proceed\nit is\nwe will not cooperate\nhow sit coming spock\ntake it easy bones\nand space travel is\nthe decisions mine if there are any decisions to be made ill make them if and when it becomes necessary\ni dont need any\nwhy did you let him do it\nanything\nwhat exactly is it\ncan you adapt i treat tune it to fit our brain pattern\ndo whatever you have to to make it work spock what disturbs me is why the via ns let us keep it\nand that we would use it to escape\nand they keep mccoy\nsomehow your e the crux the focal point of all this even before we go there she was a prisoner they didnt hurt her they didnt even threaten her\nyes there is a purpose but what is it has all the pain and terror happened or been made to happen for you\nwill it take us to mccoy\nthe best defence is a strong offense and i intend to start offending right now aim for the lab\nbones spock get him down his wrists his pulse is almost gone how is he\ndont talk dont speak take it easy until we get you back to the ship what is it whats the matter\nyou dont know your e not a doctor\nhow long\ncant we do something\ngem might be able to help him the way she helped me but could his nearness to death also kill her\nif she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking further into death we might be able to save him\nshe can save his life let us help her to go to him\nwhat purpose can all this serve except the fulfilment of some need of yours\npatient our friend is dying\nthis arena of death that you have devised for your pleasure will it prevent this catastrophe\nhow will the death of our friend serve this purpose\nwe were what could she learn from us\nthen you can not let him die\nyes bones\nwhat is it\nyes i know\nill try\nyes\nspock\nyou must save the life of our friend\nif death is all you understand here are four lives for you\nwe will not leave our friend youve lost the capacity to feel the emotions you brought gem here to experience you dont understand what it is to live love and compassion are dead in you youre nothing but intellect\nstrange\nim not puzzled mister spock i am a wed\nnono i wasnt thinking of gem i was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space we should come together with gem\nwhat scott\nyes she was all that and whether the via ns bought her or found her makes little difference she was of great value\nmister spock can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news\nmister sulu ahead warp factor two\nwe are via ns do not interfere\nnot quite doctor the field draws its energy from your bodies the more you resist the stronger the force field becomes sufficient\nwe are on schedule some further simple tests are necessary\nyour e wrong their own imperfections killed them they were not fit subjects come time is short\ntheir will to survive is great\nthe prime ingredient\nweve no interest in them they may go\nthey are safe\nwe seek no information as you mean your civilisation is yet too immature to have knowledge valuable to us\nweve already observed the intensity of your passions and gauged your capacity to love others now we want you to reveal to us your courage and strength of will\nyou are called captain you are responsible for the lives of your crew is this correct\nwhen we resume our interrogations you will decide which of your men we shall use it is essential there is an eighty seven percent chance that the doctor will die and while commander spock s life is not in danger the possibility is ninety three percent that he will suffer brain damage resulting in permanent insanity\ndoctor please understand that if there was any other way to accomplish our purpose\nno interference will be permitted\nshe must not be urged or forced to take action\nthe purpose that brought us together\nwe have but one need left in life and that is to see the completion of the final moment of our test\nthat is why we are here\nno it will not but it may save gems planet of all the planets of minar a we have the power to transport the inhabitants of only one to safety\nhis death will not serve it but her willingness to give her life for him will you were her teachers\nyour will to survive your love of life your passion to know they are recorded in her being\neach of you is willing to give his life for the others we must now find out whether that instinct has been transmitted to gem\nyour actions were spontaneous everything that is true stand best in all species of beings has been revealed by you those are the qualities that make a civilisation worthy to survive\ncompassion for another is becoming part of her functioning life system\nshes saving herself she does not yet have the instinct to save her people\nnono not yet\nhis death is not important we must wait to see whether her instinct for self sacrifice has become stronger than her instinct for self preservation\nyou can not use our powers to change what is happening\nno we will not her instinct must be developed to the fullest the test must be complete\nto offer is not proof enough\nfarewell\ni dont think i can stand another week in this godforsaken place\nwhos out there\nwhat happened to them\nthats a nasty cut jim does it hurt\nshe seems harmless enough\nshe sa mute jim no vocal cords not even vesti gals and i dont think its a pathological condition\nshe appears to be perfectly healthy as for the other her lack of vocal cords could be physiologically normal for her species whatever that is\nthats my observation for whatever its worth\nwe cant keep referring to her as she as if she were n there\nwell i dont know about you but im going to call her gem\nwell thats better than hey you\ndont fight the force field theres something about it that upsets the body metabolism\ndo you feel all right jim\nthe wound is completely healed it fits jim she must be an empath her nervous system is so sensitive highly responsive that she can actually feel our emotional and physical reactions they become part of her\nlook at this stuff\njim spock\nweve seen the results of some of your tests\nhey jim look scotty and a search party\nscotty\nwere coming\nwhere d they go\nwheres kirk\njim\nyou cant go back there youll end up like the other two\nbut captain\ncome on spock the passageway was there before its got to be there\ncaptain jim what is it what have they done to you\nhelp him dont be afraid to help him\njim you lie still ill check her out right away\nshe seems fine now\ncomplete empathy she must be a totally functional empath her nervous system actually connected to yours to counteract the worst of your symptoms and with her strength she virtually sustained your body s physiological reactions\nits impossible to say yet but supplying your body with life support did drain her\nthats true fear would naturally be her first reaction perhaps she doesnt know our captain well enough yet to offer up her life for him\noh yes however id assume that her instinct for self preservation would take over to prevent it how do you feel\ntake it easy\nyou have all the symptoms of the bends nitrogen bubbles in your blood caused the pain now how would one get the bends down here\nwell you could use sometime in a decompression chamber but otherwise id say your recovery is about miraculous i wish i could take the credit for it but she did the work\nspock why do you have to get so analytical at a time like\nspock it wont be long before the via ns comeback you better find out how that thing works and soon\nmen were nt intended to live this far underground its just not natural\nim a doctor not a coal mine r\nim not a mechanic i couldnt get that thing to work no matter how many notes you left\nin any case spock your e the logical one to leave with the captain\nim still chief medical officer of the enterprise ill tell you what you need and when you need it would you rather have the bends thats it just lie down and relax\nbetween the emotional strain and that attack of bend she sin pretty bad shape\nhow\nyou mean if i hadnt given him that shot\nnot this time spock\nthe choice has been made you stay here with my friends theyll take care of you do you understand\nget on with it\ni\nhes right jim being a doctor has its drawbacks i always wondered why i thanks\nthe correct medical phrase ay spock you ve got a a good bedside manner spock\ndont touch me stay away jim spock are you here\ndont let her touch me shell die jim i cant destroy life even if its to save my own i cant you know that i cant let you do it\nim with you captain shea wed me\nwell personally i find it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge and advances that it was good old fashioned human emotion that they valued the most\nin his hand are the deep places of the earth psalm ninety five verse four looks like he was listening\nenterprise to captain kirk come in please\nscott here sir\nour instruments have picked up a gigantic solar flare\nwith very high levels of cosmic rays accompanying it\nan enormous one\nour sensors indicate the cosmic ray concentration measures three point five one on the ritter scale that ll play the very devil with the crew as well as the ship\naye aye sir well beam you up in\nvery well sir scott out\nmister sulu will you give us an estimate of how much longer well have until those solar flares will subside\naye well as long as were stuck out here we might as well relax until the storm passes\nthats not likely the planets atmosphere will give them ample protection and if i know captain kirk hell be more worried about us than we are about him\nnot to dispute your computer mister spock but from little what youve told me i would say she was a pearl of great price\ndo you not know the story of the merchant the merchant who when he found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it\nperhaps the vulcans should hear about this\ndust apparently these instruments have not been recently used\nat that rate it will take exactly seventy four point one solar hours for the storm to pass\nremember captain what we see on this tape happened approximately three months ago\nnegative captain it doesnt register\nexactly one two one point three two metres beneath the planet surface captain\nresidual energy readings indicate we were beamed hereby a matter energy scrambler similar to our own transporter mechanism\ncaptain picking up a life form reading bearing four two marks even\nnegative although humanoid it is definitely not homo sapiens\nimpossible i can make no exact identification other than it being humanoid\napproaching the life form captain\nstill undistinguishable\nthe sand bats of man ark four appear to be inanimate rock crystals doctor until they attack\nfrom what we know of the specific gravity and other environmental factors of this planet a life form such as hers could not evolve here\nan unlikely possibility captain since over ninety eight percent of the known telepathic species send thoughts as well as receive them shes made no attempt to contact our minds\ngem doctor\ncorrect captain\ncaptain in that direction my tricorder is now picking up a substantial collection of objects\nelectronically sophisticated devices i fail to understand why my tricorder previously gave no indication of them being out there\nfascinating\nreadings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this direction\nresearch station six kilometres in that direction captain\njust ahead\ni believe they were never actually present doctor it was a mirage\ncaptain it was a mirage\ncaptain i request permission to be allowed\ndoctor im unable to lock in on the previous readings i can find no exit out of here\nher withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death doctor only your urging heron caused her to continue\ncan you recall what happened captain\ncaptain i noted that a light preceded you at the moment you were returned here from the via ns laboratory\ni conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this device to the power source\nif i can determine the frequency at which this device operates i might be able to cause it to function for us\ni would say so\ni do not know captain im beginning to understand its operating principles but that is all\nsome men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the surface\nive recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder doctor should the via ns return there is sufficient data for you and the captain to complete the adjustments\npossibly not but you and the captain together will be able to do so\nhow long will he be asleep doctor\nim not criticizing your action doctor on the contrary im quite grateful for it the captain will be spared the strain of making so difficult a decision you have simplified the situation considerably\nwhile the captain is asleep i am in command when the via ns return i shall go with them\nprecisely the choice would have been the captains now it is mine\nyour action is highly unethical my decision stands\ni was convinced in the same way you were captain by the good doctors hypo\nhmm a most unusual device it is a control unit but not a control mechanism in fact it is not a mechanical device\nthis control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy the pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it it is activated solely by mental commands\nis hall attempt to do so however it is not possible to adjust the control to fit more than one pattern at a time iam of course most familiar with my own pattern therefore with your permission i\nfascinating they must have known we were capable of comprehending this control and making use of it\nthe only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go\nthat is evidently their intention captain\nindeed the facts would indicate that she s essential to their purpose\ncompleted captain the adjustments are delicate they may not survive more than even one use however there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the enterprise\nif you so desire\nsevere heart damage signs of congestion in both lungs evidence of massive circulatory collapse\nhes dying jim we can make him comfortable but that is all\ninternal injuries bleeding in the chest and abdomen haemorrhage of the spleen and liver seventy percent kidney failure\nit could happen anytime\nim afraid not\nuncertain captain dr mccoys analysis of her reaction assumes that her instinct for self preservation would prevent it however we can not be positive\nwhat purpose can be served by the death of our friend except to bring you pleasure surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that your star system will soon be extinct your sun will nova\nthen you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed\nyou were correct captain everything that has occurred here has been caused to happen by them this has all been a great laboratory and we have been the subjects of the test\ncaptain dr mccoys life is not solely dependent on gem the via ns too must be capable of saving his life\ncaptain\nthe intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the force field\nit draws its energy from us captain in spite of what we see all emotion must be suppressed that might weaken the field\nit is complete gem has earned the right of survival for her planets he offered her life\nwhat is puzzling you captain\ncaptain the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a civilisation as advanced as the via ns\npossibly captain is hall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due\naye sir readings now indicate two points even two one on the ritter scale at the present rate of decrease well have to wait at least seventeen hours more before we can even attempt to enter orbit\nthe storms already lasted four hours longer than weve anticipated do you

board\nthe thing most feared and hated by my people our most deadly enemy\nwelcome i am petri ambassador of troy i us\nyour glory i am petri in the name of my people\nplease\nthat creature ela an is to be the wife of our ruler to bring peace our two warring planets now possess the capability of mutual destruction some method of coexistence must be found\nyes but slowly captain i will need time before we reach there she must be taught civilised manners in her present condition my people would never accept her\nthose are my orders i must ask you and your crew to respect or at least tolerate their arrogance friction must be kept at a minimum\nanother thing you should understand captain you have as much at stake as i have your superiors made the statement that failure of this mission would be as catastrophic for federation planning as it would be for our two planets to gain peace at the price of accepting such a queen is no victory i will take her the official gifts i bear perhaps that will soften her mood\nyour glory these are your wedding slippers\nthis this is your wedding dress a gift from the bridegroom smother\nthis this is the most prized of royal jewels for your lovely neck\ni explained to her glory that her council of nobles and the troy i us tribunal jointly agreed that i should instruct make her acquainted with the customs and manners of our people\ncaptain i wish to contact my government i can not fulfil my mission it would be an insult to our ruler to bring this incorrigible monster as a bride\nthere can not be peace between us we have deluded ourselves captain when i am near them i do not want peace i want to kill them\njob the job is impossible we can not make peace with people we detest\nbut if she wont listen to me\ni fire cover it will be no thanks to you captain\ni shouldve known better than to talk to her unarmed but you forced me i hold you responsible for this\nits not magic its biochemical a man whose flesh is once touched by the tears of a woman of elas has his heart enslaved forever\nthere will be no wedding i would not have our ruler marry that monster if the entire galaxy depended on it and i will have nothing further to do with you\nhere you put me captain here i will stay i have nothing further to say to you\ndoctor there is no antidote to the poison of el asian tears the men of elas have tried desperately for centuries to dispel its power your e wasting your time doctor\nsafety what is your estimate of our chances for survival doctor\nnow that we are all about to die i ask you once again to accept this necklace and to wear it as a token of respect for the desperate wishes of your people and mine for peace\naye but why the secrecy this star systems under federation control\nfrom what ive seen its not worth fighting about why are we here captain\ncaptain youll not be using the warp drive all the way on impulse that ll take a great deal of time\nno\nengineering to captain kirk\ncaptain i know what you said about showing respect but must i have these persons fool around with my equipment\nwell i suppose lassie that even our impulse engines must seem fast compared to your nuclear propulsion

sort of transmitter\ncaptain you must realise the time\naye\ncaptain the matter antimatter\nthe antimatter pods are rigged to blow up the moment we go into warp drive\nnot without being blown half way across the galaxy\nscott to captain\nive got bad news captain the entire dilithium crystal converter assembly is fused no chance of repair\nits completely unusable\nnot without dilithium crystals we cant even generate enough power to fire our weapons\nninety three percent of impulse power sir\nmanoeuvre aye we can wallow like a garbage scow against a warp driven starship\nour shields will hold for a few passes but without the matter antimatter reactor weve no chance captain can you not call starfleet on this emergency\nno sir not a chance\nwere fitting it now sir but well have to run a few tests to make sure\naye that could blow us up just as effectively as\nscott to captain\nits in place sir but i cant answer for what happens\nfluctuation its the shape of the crystals i was afraid of

vicious and arrogant\nnot without precedent captain remember that\ni am the first officer this is captain james kirk\ncaptain the d ohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided\ni do not know but all the el asians seem most irrational\nat first it appeared to be a sensor ghost but ive run checks on all the instrumentation all the equipment is functioning perfectly\nnone in this area nothing that would account for it the ghost appears intermittently\nnone captain insufficient data\nbridge to captain\nthat sensor ghost is moving closer\ncaptain we had a momentary fix on the object enough to establish it was a spaceship\nno data yet\nour ghost has materialised\nnegative captain the klingon ship has simply moved into contact range she is pacing us precisely matching our sub lightspeed and on a parallel course\ncaptain your analysis of the situation was flawless anticipating that she would deny you admittance however the logic by which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me\ni have it on my sensor lieutenant\nspock here captain i am triangulating now its coming from the engineering section\nspock here captain\ncaptain\ncaptain\nmay we see you a moment\ncaptain are you all right\nit is true then captain\ntheir speed is better than warp six captain\ni dont think they meant to attack us we were very fortunate this time\nvery but why do the klingons consider the possession of this system so vital\ni have another question captain is not the bridge the wrong place for the d ohlman at a time like this\nthey demand an immediate reply\nwe can still manoeuvre\nhelp could not

if that madman is in command of the enterprise he boasts that he s created the most powerful explosive in the universe and i believe him\nthe people of antos taught him the techniques of cellular metamorphosis to restore the destroyed parts of his body by himself he later learned to use the technique to recreate himself into any form he wished the first time we knew about it was when a guard

not a request\nmarvellous isnt she captain\nwhat is your reaction mister spock\nnostalgic\nshes yours if you wish captain\nyou ll find that i am magnanimous to my friends and merciless to my enemies and i want you both of you to be my friends\nupon the firmest of foundations mister spock enlightened self interest you captain are second only to me as the finest military commander in the galaxy\nand so have i been i have charted more new worlds than any man in history\nwell i could say because they were actively hostile to the federation\nagreed actually they were quite harmless and they made me whole when i was maimed and dying and in my gratitude i offered them the galaxy they rejected me and i condemned them to death\nthat was my only miscalculation i had changed i had risen above this decadent weakness which still has you in its command by the way captain my crew had not i couldnt sway them but my new crew the men in this room will obey my orders without question gentlemen you have eyes but you can not see galaxies surround us limitless vistas and yet the federation would have us grub away like some ants on some somewhat larger than usual anthill but i am not an insect i am master of the universe and i must claim my domain\nas well it should be\npeace mission politicians and weaklings\nmister spock do you consider captain kirk and yourself brothers\nblind truly blind captain kirk is your commanding officer and you are his subordinate that is all yet mister spock you are a worthy commander in your own right and in my fleet you will surely have a

must take what is right full yours from the decadent weaklings that now hold it\nlord garth\ni was betrayed and treated barbaric ally\nremove this animal\ntry some of this wine captain it has a robust full bodied flavour which you ll find diverting\nand i prefer that you remain here marta my dear we found your little divertissement enchanting didnt we captain but theres more to come the entertainment has merely begun by the way i assume you play chess\nso do i how would you respond to queen to queens level three\nim interested in only one\nfor the life of me is a phrase well chosen it could literally come to that\nbut i can make you long for death beg for death\noh dont beg marta its degrading queen to queens level three captain youll talk freely and quite so on what you see before you captain is my latest invention quite ordinary in appearance almost primitive wouldnt you say\nappearances can be deceiving once it was a part of the rehabilitation process and as such quite painless and i might add useless too it made men docile and of no use to me ive added certain refinements to the use of ultrasonic waves the chair is no longer painless put the governor in it queen to queens level three captain kirk it is in fact exquisitely painful as you will now see\ninteresting isnt it the pain is real and can be prolonged indefinitely because there is no actual destruction of tissue\nof course captain you have but to ask now as you can see he has not been harmed physically yet the memory of the exquisite torment remains queen to queens level three captain\ntoo bad remove our distinguished governor put captain kirk in the chair\nyou really are becoming offensive to me my dear dont make it necessary for me to put you in it queen to queens level three captain kirk\nyou want him dont you\nbadly enough to join him\nit might be interesting to have you try\nblast away captain if you can do you think im fool enough to give you a charged phaser\ni have done nothing with him as of yet but i do have plans for him the vulcan will die rather horribly and his death will be on your conscience\nlord garth\nand i was the greatest of them all wasnt i\ni have never been more

have failed alexander caesar napoleon hitler lee kuan k rot us all of them are dust but i will triumph i will make the ultimate conquest\nthe throne must be higher it must be higher than anything else in this room use that table as a pedestal ah welcome back captain kirk im glad you could make it for the coronation\nyes oh i know that even a real throne is no more than merely a chair but the symbolism is important dont you agree\nbut again just as a token not impressive in itself but it will serve as a standard around which our followers will rally\nyou do refuse to enter into the spirit of the thing dont you captain perhaps you d like a larger role in the ceremony you could serve as human sacrifice for example\nhow true all right how about crown prince that would make you our heir apparent heir apparent i believe is the proper role for you besides we have other candidates for our human sacrifice who knows ready\nnow remove our heir apparent that we may conclude this ceremony\nwell done well captain you continue to resist how stupid of you put him in that chair right here ive arranged a small entertainment i wouldnt want him to miss any of it well captain even you must admit that im a genius what you see here is my latest invention this is an explosive the most powerful one in history if i were to drop this flask the resulting explosion would vapor ise this planet now do you see why it is ridiculous to resist me well perhaps you require the demonstration ive arranged watch closely\nnow it is true that she is deadly as a poisonous serpent but she is also a beautiful woman and you have held her in your arms captain ive ordered my men to drive her out of the protective dome and of course she would choke to death on the outside in minutes\nbut ive arranged a more merciful end for her because after all captain she is my consort one tiny crystal implanted in her necklace a portion of this explosive no bigger than a grain of sandi propose to detonate it from here\npoor girl poor dear suffering child i will help her now\nhere\nhow are your nerves kirk\nyour e an extraordinary fellow kirk your stubbornness defies all logic logic that is the key your friend spock is a logical man a very logical mango and bring the vulcan here to me\nspock is not only a more logical man than you captain but a more intelligent one im sure i shall establish

frustration he forces upon me and thereby prove his point that i am a madman\nah mister chekov therein lies my lack of ability to alert you and your captain to the real threat of someone like be le you see you are from the planet earth there is no persecution on your planet how can you understand my fear my apprehension my degradation my suffering\nyou have read about it in history i see how can i make your flesh know how it feels to see all those who are like you and only because they are like you despised slaughtered and even worse denied the simplest bit of decency that is a living beings right do you know what it would be like to be dragged out of your hovel into a war on another planet a battle that will serve your oppressor and bring death to you and your brothers\nso this is justice after ariannu s you have signed my death warrant i warned you what to expect will you continue to let this mockery of justice go on if you are partisans of justice prove it kill him\nwhat do you do carry justice on your tongues you will beg for it but you wont fight or die for it\nyou useless pieces of bland flesh ill take you with me you half black\nremember captain political sanctuary

of the same breed as yourself\ncommissioner perhaps the experience of my own planet vulcan may set an example of some value to you vulcan was in danger of being destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to destroy cheron we were once a people like yourselves wildly emotional often committed to irrationally opposing points of view leading of course to death and

what and where im waiting for your explanation of why\ndo you have evidence the captains life is threatened permission denied\nso noted\ncoordinates confirmed\nwe should never have agreed to such restrictions\nare there any other possibilities\ncaptain kirk this is ambassador hod in the council is still awaiting your arrival\nthats impossible\nhe never arrived\neight seven five zero two zero zero seven nine\nwe gave you the exact coordinates which should have brought captain kirk directly to this very room\nif he is not here that is your own responsibility mister spock and that of your staff\nwe are glad to hear that we shall enter it into the records of this most unfortunate event\nlet us hope it was on dry land\npermission denied\nyour federation must be aware\nof our jealous tradition of isolation from all contaminating contacts\nwith the violent nature of planets of other star systems\nof course we shall institute a thorough search in the meantime mister spock i suggest that you look to your machinery\ngood news very good news indeed mister spock your captain is definitely not on gideon as you requested we made a most thorough search and you will be relieved to know that you may now investigate all the other possibilities and forget about gideon\nyou requested a most thorough search it is in the record and we have used every means at our disposal to accommodate you\nsurely mister spock you do not intend i hope to create a dispute between the federation and gideon\nmister spock your e an officer of a spaceship in your profession you use many instruments tools and weapons to achieve your objectives\nhowever the only tool diplomacy has is language\nit is of the utmost importance that the meaning be crystal clear\nim glad to hear it perhaps you could then make greater effort to choose your words more precisely\nmister spock mister spock\nare you still there\nthere was considerable interference with your transmission a lot of noise drowned out\nwhat was said would you repeat please\nforgive me mister spock no criticism of your equipment was intended but it has sent your captain on some strange journey a safe one we all still hope\nbut it could create for us serious incidents with your federation and now you propose to\nrepeat this disaster with another officer this would be madness\ni could not quite make that out mister spock\nwould you be so good as to repeat what you said\nbut mister spock you\nyou are a very persistent fellow mister spock very well then you shall test the skill of your very excitable\nrepairman\nthere is one proviso we can not risk further incidents you will therefore transport a member of my staff to your ship let us first see if that works\nmy assistant will provide you with the proper what is the word\nthank you proceed k rod ak\nnow now not so fast mister spock that is quite a different matter we agreed to allow one representative on our soil your captain\nforgive me mister spock but i overstepped my authority when i made that agreement however your request will be taken up at the next full session of gideons council\nyes captain kirk our experiment has passed the first stage\nwe have no need of any of your medicines\nand were grateful to you for her illness you have done well my daughter\nguard the captain well we shall need him for a long time\nthat depends on the strength of the one infected you have great strength\nyour body temperature will be very great you will see us but you will not know who we are\nrest now lie still do you feel great pain\nwhat is it like to feel pain\nyour courage gives me great pride\nnot yet\nbut we do she has vegan choriomeningitis\nyes our prime minister learned about you during our negotiations thats why we brought you here your blood provided the microorganisms which infected her\nyes a sod on a told you we have no need for medical practitioners here our apologies we were un for giv ably awkward to have hurt you\nno we are desperate\nand so it was a long long time ago what we described was true the atmosphere on gideon has always been germ free and the people flourished in their physical and spiritual perfection eventually even the lifespan increased death became almost unknown to us it occurred only when the body could no longer regenerate itself and that happens now only to the very old\nbut gideon did not find it enviable the birth rate continued to rise and the population grew until now gideon is encased in a living mass who can find no rest no peace no joy\nevery organ renews itself it would be impossible\nbut you see the people of gideon have always believed that life is sacred that the love of life is the greatest gift that is the one unshakable truth of gideon and this overwhelming love of life has developed our regenerative capacity and our great longevity\nthat is bitterly true captain nevertheless we can not deny the truth which shaped our evolution we are incapable of destroying or interfering with the creation of that which we love so deeply life in every form from foetus to developed being it is against our tradition against our very nature we simply could not do it\nwere trying to read just the life cycle of an entire civilisation\nmy daughter hoped to make you feel the agony of gideon but it was impossible no stranger could realize the horror that life can be here i will not beg for your understanding of my personal grief nor will i parade it for you to gain your cooperation my love for my daughter is too deep for display my pride in her runs even deeper my daughter freely chose to do what she is doing as the people of gideon are free to choose\nyou will stay your blood will provide it\nmy daughter pleaded with you to stay\nshe hoped you would love her and wish to stay\nstay with us were desperate\nyou see you can not leave us now go to her\nwe have told you it is her wish and mine that there be no interference with the natural progress of the virus\nno her death at so young an age will let the people know for certain that our life cycle can be changed its the symbol that ll bring forth the dedicated young volunteers the serum in their new blood will change gideon and it will once more be the paradise it was\nyou wont have long to wait\nlets go mister spock\nmister spock mister spock i have not yet transported down why did you leave

aboard\nsickbay doctor mccoy\nbones bones answer me\nbones still orbiting gideon\ni am alone on the enterprise i have searched every area of the ship and still can not find a trace of the crew or an indication of how its disappearance was managed the one thing that is obvious is that i suffered a memory lapse during which time i bruised my arm it is causing me some irritation\nwho are you\nwhat are you doing on my ship\nnot my personal property but im the captain\nit seems at the moment we have it all to ourselves\nkirk im sorry james kirk and i didnt bring you here\nthats right who has brought you here\nyou what happened before you came here try to remember its important\ndont be afraid\ni seem to be the only one of my crew left onboard the enterprise four hundred and thirty and i apparently am the only one left\nmaybe you can tell me the rest you were fighting for oxygen screaming to get out of there\nhow long have you been aboard the enterprise\nit might become with me\nnine minutes of my life has been lost\nbetween the time i tried to be am down to gideon and the time i found myself here alone nine minutes have disappeared just like that now what happened during those minutes\nthats your home the planet that you come from\nit must be\nthats impossible we were in synchronous orbit over the capital city of gideon i tried to be am down something happened and you were beamed aboard from gideon\nwere no longer over gideon\ni dont know im not familiar with that quadrant o dona you must realise that were not here by accident some force some intelligence has arranged this for a purpose\nenterprise to starfleet command enterprise to starfleet command captain kirk here red priority red priority\nit seems to be\ncaptain kirk here please answer red priority please answer red priority well if someone is listening theyre not answering\nthey wouldnt\ntook the ship out of warp speed\nspace terminology were no longer moving faster than the speed of light ive trimmed down to sub lightspeed until we find out where we are\nof course it does maybe it is the same\nif you believe that we have\nit isnt really you know\nyes yes it is very very beautiful\nhow long would you like it to last\nwell lets see power thats no problem it regenerates and food we have enough to feed a crew of four hundred and thirty for five years so that should last us\nmost people are afraid of being alone\nwhy why are the people of gideon like that\nit might be gideon\nyes it might help me pinpoint our location\nive got to contact whoever is manipulating us there must be away odon aod on a can you remember why your people dream of being alone\nwhy what makes it so impossible to be alone\nwho sent you here\nyouve come to kill o dona have you come to die\nnow all i have to do is find a medical kit and i can completely cure this\nyes the irritation would be gone\nno over something as simple as this no itll cure itself eventually but do you know uh i dont even remember how this happened do you hear that\nnot he ships engines dont make that kind of sound\ni know every sound that this ship might make thats coming from outside\na storm might but you wouldnt be able to hear it come on\nthis is a viewing port well be able to see outside if theresa storm well be able to see it\nif it works\nit was like the heartbeat of all those people and thousands upon thousands more pressing against the ship\nyes i said that\nyes they can\nit could be a mirage they could exist in our minds\nor some power is creating the illusion in our minds that we are somewhere near your planet but why\ni think i have an idea so that we wont keep trying to find out where we are that well be content to stay here\nbe content be content not until i find out what happened to my crew are they dead\ndid you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself\nive never felt like this before either\ntheres no sickness on your planet remember\nhod in\nlet me in there i can help her\nbut she sill\nlet me see her\nyou dont know what she may have\nits very rare and always fatal if not treated within twenty four hours i know it almost killed me\nthat show my arm got hurt\nyour emad\nyour report to the federation was at issue of lies you described environmental physical cultural conditions that would make gideon a paradise\nthose are conditions most people would envy\nthen why havent you introduced any of the new techniques to sterilise men and women\nthen let your people learn about the devices to safely prevent conception the federation will provide anything you need\nand the great misery which you now face\nyet you can kill a young girl\nyour e killing your own daughter how can you do that\nthe virus you need is very rare who will provide it\nno sir not me you have many methods available ive mentioned only a few i do not offer my life for this purpose i have many plans and i have hopes other than death for od on a\nwhat was said and what happened between us was for us alone\nso that was your plan that i would fall so under her spell that i would give up my freedom and become a willing sacrifice\nif you dont allow me to bring doctor mccoy down here itll soon be too late to do anything for her\nher death is unnecessary even if she lives her blood will provide the same serum you need as mine would\nvery short\nand it can continue if only youll allow mei can cure you\nmister spock we have a patient for doctor mccoy have scotty beam us up\nwhy because your e well again\nat least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you\nthank you maam\nis that

spock\nyou mean you re going to scan space for him\nare you going to let him get away with that\nwe do not leave without being absolutely sure ourselves that everything has been done\nnow certainly you understand our feelings about that\njust when i was beginning to think you might find a whole new career as a diplomat mister spock\ni dont understand how starfleet can deny permission to be am down to search for the captain\nthats the best possible decision you could make spock im with you\ncoordinates dont match\nill pick up my medical tricorder and meet you in the transporter room\nim not asking you to make the decision for me\nin that case its the worst possible decision you can make spock\nan exact duplicate of the enterprise is it in orbit mister spock\nwell thats a beginning but what about the captain\nwell that was close but you made it\nright just like the captain\nodon ayes my name is od on a why did you bring me here\nis this entire ship yours\nand you have it all to

you might find your crew being here with you i forgot there must be others i envy you your sense of loyalty i want to ease your feeling of dread your fear that all your crew no longer exists\nbecause they never can be\nbecause there are so many of us so many there is no place no street no house no garden no beach no mountain that is not filled with people each one of us would kill in order to find a place alone to himself they would willingly die for it if they could\nno one command so do nai was not sent here\ni dont know i dont care i only know im here i only know im happy\ncure\nwhat will happen if you do not find one will you become sick and die\nyes it sounds like an engine\nbut there is something wrong with the equipment could that be it\na storm might\npeople the faces of people

wish only to save the life of the captain\ni am positive that i can do so to your satisfaction admiral i have been convinced since my first exchange with the ambassador that the captain has been taken prisoner\ni now know where the captain is being held if he is being held at the same place to which we transported him\nsir the captain is not being held in the gideon council chamber he is being held nearby\nsince the planet is shielded from our sensors we can not establish that without on the spot investigation\nadmiral i wish to state for the record that your decision is completely

seismic force\nhes right captain theres nothing there\nyes sir\nno sir and i havent seen any evidence that there ever has been any rainfall\nyes sir could be\nyes sir\nim not geological disturbances dont frighten me ive come here to study them my specialty\nthats right how did you know that\nyes and were stranded here you been talking to my friends\nim not afraid\nyour e your e the woman on the enterprise\nlucky damato i want to have a conference about sharing your food and water\na ghost planet\nlets take the facts one by one that should explain something\nits size is approximately that of earths moon\nthat would be difficult to explain\nand yet it has\nbut a fascinating one mister spock\nit would bear closer investigation it would seem if were to provide starfleet with an accurate report lieutenant send doctor mccoy to the transporter room for survey party well also need senior geologist damato\nfeed beam down coordinates to the transporter room mister sulu youll accompany me mister spock you have the conn\nthis expedition should be a geologists dream mister damato\nyes if mister spock is correct youll have a report to startle the fifth interstellar geophysical conference\na planet that even spock cant explain prepare to transport energise\nthat woman attacked ensign wyatt\ni dont know any more like that and theyll tear this planet apart\ncould seismic stress have accounted for it\nthats very strange and that woman kirk to enterprise kirk to enterprise come in the shock may have damaged it\nfor one thing it means were stranded\nshall we stop guessing mister sulu and try and establish a pattern i get no readings of high energy concentration if the enterprise had blown up it would have left a high residual radiation\nmister sulu if id wanted a russian history lesson id have brought along mister chekov this is a matter of survival gentlemen without the enterprise we need food and we need water and we need them fast i want a detailed analysis made of this planet and i want it now\nmister sulu\nyour report covers all vegetation\nyes i dont see any water but there must be some to grow the vegetation a source of water would stretch our survival did you see any evidence of rainfall\nbut there is earth type vegetation\nyes thats possible theres also the possibility of underground water\nthis apparently is going to be our home for as long as we last i suggest we find out as much as we can about it split up dama to see if you can find underground water\nsulu run an atmospheric analysis\nbones see if you can find out anything about the vegetation and your parasite how do they get their moisture if you can discover how they survive maybe we can\nkirk here\nkirk out\nkirk here\nwhat do you mean just there\nas though a door opened and closed\nwhat direction\nhang on damato s section come in kirk to dama to come income in bones sulu damato doesnt answer\nbones\ndigging a grave\nthere are no good ways sulu\nmy phaser didnt cut through it\neight thousand degrees centigrade it looks like igneous rock but infinitely denser\nmister sulu it might explain this place a little better if we knew what the substance is i know it was damato s field but see what you can find out\nyeah it might be the most suitable memorial at that\ni dont know but something or someone did\nwe ve got to figure this out and devise a defence against it is it possible that the rocks have life\nunless were dealing with beings intelligent beings who can shield themselves\nthats the problem sulu we have only questions no answers\nexcept for a momentary fluctuation on your instruments this planet has no magnetic field the apparent age of these rocks is only a few thousand years no known process could evolve the plant life they have herein that short space of time\nthe planet might be hollow they might be shielding themselves from our sensor probes its dark lets get some rest tomorrow we have to find some food and some water or its going to be a very unpleasant stay\nall right takeda matos tricorder set it for automatic distress you never can tell\nhold it who are you\nhow can you destroy others and not me\nwho are you why are you trying to kill us\nare there men on this planet\nno\nbones did you see that may be spock was wrong perhaps this is a ghost planet\nyes i know\nthats a good questions he touched the transporter chief he collapsed immediately she apparently got to damato we saw what happened to him the question is why are you alive\nthe power to totally disrupt biological cell structures ulus alive because i intervened but that raises an even worse question\nshes not through yet\nlieutenant sulu do you feel strong enough to move about\nis he bones\nall right whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be aimed at one specific person at one specific time if im correct when she reappears the other two might protect the one shes after by interposing their bodies no weapons seem to affect her\ncontrols a refused drop\napparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us come on lets go\nyes like a door opening\nwho have you come for this time\nwhy do you want to kill us\nthen why do you want to kill me\nwere here on a peaceful mission its you who have killed our people we mean no harm to you we want to leave peacefully\nan android\nwho are you\ncommander of what\nstation station where how do you feel about killing me\nstay between us\nyou want to kill me\nthen why do it if you dont want to\nby whom\nare there others on this planet\nhow long have you been alone are you lonely\nand the rest his power surge right off the scale like a door closing it must be near here\nright off the scale its remained at a peak ever since she disappeared the entrance is here\nit certainly looks like it and the invitation doesnt exactly relax me\ni agree\ni dont know but whatever civilisation exists on this planet is in there and without the enterprise gentlemen the only source of food and water is in there lets go\nwho have you come for form a circle you see you d better tell us tell us who have you come for who have you come for your e a very determined woman for me\ngentlemen i need your help\nweve seen the results of your touch\nthat is how you kill youll never reach me\nthat computer must be programming these replicas\nshift positions\nspock the computer destroy it\nmister spock i certainly am glad to see you i thought you and the enterprise had been destroyed\nreturned from where\nwas mister spock its defences were run by computer\nthere were replicas of one of them but that power to recreate them has been destroyed\nwell you wouldnt have thought so mister spock if you d been among us\nthe computer was too perfect it projected so much of los iras personality into the replica that it felt regret guilt at killing that bought us the time we needed to destroy it she must have been a remarkable woman\nkirk to enterprise five to beam up i

recorded welcome but we who have guarded the outpost for you will be dead by the time you take possession of this planet i am the last of our advanced force left alive too late the physicians discovered the cause of this sickness that kills us in creating this planet we have accidentally produced a deadly organism i have awaited the regular supply ship from home for medical assistance but i doubt now whether it will arrive in time i will set the outpost controls on automatic the computer will selectively defend against all life forms but our own my fellow kal and an silos ira wish you well\nsickbay doctor mb eng a\nwere not sure doctor sanchez is conducting an autopsy right now\nsickbay to mister spock\nyou asked for an autopsy report its only preliminary but the cause of death seems to have been cellular disruption\nits as though every cell in the body had been individually blasted from inside\ndoctor sanchez has ruled that possibility out sir\nyes we have mister spock\nwell the pattern of cellular disruption was the same but as to the cause well your guess is as good as mine\nwhy what is it jim\njim did you see what is a w\nhow could it be gone what the devil does that mean jim\ncould it be the enterprise hit the planet\nif the enterprise has been destroyed you know how long we can survive\nis it possible the vegetation could absorb the water directly from the air\nsul us picked up an organism thats almost a virus like a a plant parasite its the nearest biological form of life i can find\nmccoy to kirk\njimi just got a life form reading of tremendous intensity suddenly it was just there\njust that all levels were normal then i get this biological surge of life form registering no now its gone\nyes\nzero eight three\nill be right there\njim every cell in his body s been disrupted\njim what are you doing\nwhatever it is it has a mighty high melting point\nthis whole planet must be made up of this substance covered over by topsoil\nwell i guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for damato\ni wonder what killed him\nit would be worse if he had company\nim not joking until we know what killed him none of us are safe\nbut our instruments recorded that they were life forms they registered as life forms\ncaptain it doesnt make sense in fact nothing about this planet makes sense\nare you suggesting this might be an artificial planet\nwhile it lasts\nwell all i know is she almost made a ghost out of sulu his shoulder where she touched it every cells been disrupted exploded from within if shed really gotten a good grip on him jim\ntheresa layer of necrotic tissue a few cells thick a normal wound would heal quickly\njim what kind of power must she have\nyes why didnt she kill you\nhe sin fair shape\nkeep behind us jim\ncaptain im getting no lifeform register\nthat would give a mechanical reading im getting nothing\nshes not registering\nis the power level still holding jim\nyou think were being invited in\nwe ve been led here why\nwatch out 2\nthe women match our chromosome patterns after they touch us\nthe previous ships probably spread the disease all through their people the supply ship that she was waiting for never came all these thousands of years shes been waiting to greet people who were dead\nand beautiful\nmister spock the planets gone\nno debris of any kind sir ive made two full scans if the planet had broken up the red be some sign but what bothers me is the stars mister spock\nyes sir theyre wrong\nyes mister spock look now heres a replay of the star pattern just before the explosion\nit doesnt make any sense but somehow id say that in a flash we ve been knocked one thousand light years away from where we were\nalready plotted and laid in sir\nwere holding warp eight point four sir if we can maintain it our estimated time of arrival is eleven and one half solar hours\nmister spock speed is increased to warp eight point eight\naye sir warp seven mister spock our speed has increased to warp eight point nine and still climbing\nmister spock were at warp eleven point two and accelerating\naye sir ill jettison the pod at the first sign of trouble\nyes sir warp eleven point nine\nfifty seven seconds to go\nwarp thirteen point two sir\ntwenty seconds mister spock\nnine seconds\neight seconds seven seconds\nsix seconds five seconds four seconds three seconds two seconds\none mister spock now warp fourteen point one warp fourteen\nwarp thirteen point nine and dropping\nengineering no damage all power levels normal\naye sir\nbut thats not possible nothing can do that\nthe point is it shouldnt have hurled us anywhere why it should have destroyed us immediately vapor is ed us\nwhat your e saying is that the planet didnt blow up and the captain and the others theyre still alive\naye sir but even at that it ll take awhile to get there\naye sir and may be a wee bit more ill sit on the warp engines myself and nurse them\nscott to bridge scott to bridge\nmister spock the ship feels wrong\ni know it doesnt make sense instrumentation reads correct but the feel is wrong\nits something i cant quite put into words\nwatkins check the bypass valve on the matter antimatter reaction chamber make sure its not overheating\ni didnt ask you to check the board lad\noh you poor lad scott to bridge scott to bridge\nmy assistant watkins is dead\ni didnt see it happen but his last words were a warning cry about some strange woman\nyou mean that one of the people who threw usa thousand light years away from that planet is on board and killing our people\nthen your e right mister spock watkins must ve been murdered i sent him into check the matter antimatter reactor there are no exposed circuits there it couldnt have been anything he touched\nbridge to engineering\nscotty here i see it\nits a power surge im working on it reduce speed until i locate the trouble\naye mister spock and i found out why the emergency bypass control of the matter antimatter integrator is fused\nits completely useless the engines are running wild theres no way to get at them we should reach maximum overload in about fifteen minutes\nthose few seconds will not make any difference mister spock because you andi and the rest of the crew will no longer be here to bandy it back and forth\nthis thing is going to blow up\nand theres nothing in the universe can stop it\nits useless and theres no question its deliberate\naye and a thorough job the systems foolproof whoever murdered watkins sabotaged this\nthats what worries me\nwell its fused all right but it would take all the power of our main phaser banks to do it\ni find nothing interesting in the fact that were about to blow up\nwhatever did this is still a board this ship i fail to understand why you cancelled the security alert\naye\ntheresa service crawl way but its not meant to be used while the integrator operates\nwhat with bare hands\nany matter that comes in contact with antimatter triggers the explosion and im not even sure a man can live in the crawl way in the energy stream of the magnetic field that bottles up the antimatter\nyoull be killed man\naye your e right what have we got to lose but ill do it mister spock i know every millimetre of that system ill do whatever has to be done\naye it was an emotional statement i dont expect you to understand it\nmister spock we dont have time for that\nall right lads get the crawl way door open hand me the tools communicator all right headfirst i hope mister spock knows what he s doing\nive sealed off the aft end of the service crawl way and ive positioned explosive separator charges to blast me clear of the ship if i rupture the magnetic bottle im so close to the flow now it feels like ants crawling all over my body\ni heard that the ships not structured to take that speed for any length of time\nall right mister spock im starting to open the access panel now\naccess to the flow itself\nif the magnetic flow jumps you must jettison me the safety control\nwill not hold more than two seconds if i rupture the field\nive removed the access plate and ive got static electric charges dancing on the instruments looks like an aurora borealis in there\nits hard to see theres so much disturbance that any attempt to get at the flow would rupture the magnetic field\ni know what time it is i dont need a blooming cuckoo clock\nmister spock\nim going to try to cut through the magnetic flow but if the probe doesnt precisely match the magnetic flow there llbean explosion starting right now\nreverse polarity\nthat ll take some doing what purpose could it\ni have no time for theory i just hope your e right\nim doing the best i can wait its stuck its stuck push the button\ndont be a fool push the button its your last chance dont be sentimental push it im going to die anyway\nits loose but theres no time push the button\nyou might at least say thank you\nnever mind\ni suggest no supernatural explanation captain i merely point out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets\nundoubtedly the age of this planet would seem to be only a few thousand years it would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so short a period\nbut its mass and atmosphere are similar to earth\nit would be impossible captain an atmosphere could not evolve in so short a period of time\nevidently but the inconsistencies are so compounded as to present a seemingly impossible phenomenon\nprecisely captain\nlieutenant rah da report to the bridge immediately\nyes i believe no permanent damage was done\nthe occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the chair\nthat we have yet to ascertain\nreport on the death of the transporter officer\ngive me a full report as soon as possible please spock out mister scott have the transporter checked for possible malfunction\nthe stars\nwrong\na positional change\nnine hundred and ninety points even light years to be exact lieutenant\nmister scott since we are here your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation it is also illogical to assume that any explosion even that of a small star going supernova could have hurled usa distance of nine hundred and ninety points even light years\nthat is correct mister scott by all the laws that we know there was no period of unconsciousness our ships chronometers registered a matter of only a few seconds therefore we were displaced through space in some manner which i am unable to fathom\nplease mister scott restrain your leaps of illogic i have said nothing i was merely speculating\nspock here\nexplain\nwould any known disease organism do that\nplease keep me fully advised spock out he was in the transporter room someone may have entered after captain kirk and his party left mister scott since the enterprise is obviously functional i suggest we return to our starting place at top warp speed\nin that case mister scott i suggest we start at once can you give me warp eight\nthat position mister scott would not only be unavailing but also undignified lieutenant rah da plot a course\ngood then prepare to come to warp eight\neleven point three three seven hours lieutenant i wish you would be more precise\nspock here\nfeels mister scott\nthat is obvious mister scott i suggest you avoid emotionalism and simply keep your instruments correct\nspock out\nspock here\ndo you know what he died of mister scott\nsecurity alert all decks female intruder extremely dangerous security alert all decks kirk conclusions\nspock to sickbay have you completed the autopsy on watkins doctor\nwas the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer\nmy guess doctor would be valueless i suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts\nspock out\nthe power of this intruder to disrupt every cell in a body combined with the almost inconceivable power required to hurl the enterprise such a distance speak of a very high culture and a very great danger\na reasonable assumption mister scott\nif there are more of those beings on that planet the captain and the others are in very great danger\nvery well cancel red alert but maintain increased security\nplease update our subspace report to starfleet to include security search results negative\npresumably the same way she got on\nlieutenant we are not engaged in gambling we are proceeding in the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen and factually ascertain whether or not they still live\nvery well reduce speed to warp seven\nbridge to engineering negative effect on power reduction speed is still increasing\ni would calculate fourteen point eight seven minutes mister scott\nsabotage\nyou said it was fused how\nworries mister scott\ninteresting\nno but the method is fascinating\na force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety points even light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage our main source of energy will not be waiting around to be taken into custody\nas i recall the pattern of our fuel flow there is an access tube leading to the matter antimatter reaction chamber\nstill it is there and it might be possible to shut off the fuel at that point\na magnetic probe\ni shall try\nunless a solution is found quickly that fate awaits all of us\nvery well mister scott you spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong\ninote it mister scott without necessarily understanding iti propose to run an analysis through the ships computers comparing the present condition of the enterprise with her ideal condition\nwe have twelve minutes and twenty seven seconds i suggest you do whatever you can in the service crawl way while i make the computer study\nmister scott i suggest you refrain from any further subjective descriptions you now have ten minutes and nineteen seconds in which to perform your task\nyou now have ten minutes and ten seconds\nim aware of these facts please get on with the job computer\nanalysis on my comparison coordinates\nlieutenant uhura you are monitoring the magnetic force\nplease do not take your eyes off of it lieutenant rah da arm the pod jettison system\nnot until my order\nmister scott what is your situation\nyou have eight minutes forty one seconds\ncomputer readout\ncontinue\nunderstood\nspock here\nmister scott ease off\ncomputer for out phase condition will reverse field achieve closure\nmister scott\nreverse polarity on your magnetic probe\nthat is correct mister scott\nplease commence ill explain\nyou were correct in your feel the enterprise was put through a molecular transporter and reassembled slightly out of phase reverse polarity should seal the incision\nplease continue mister scott\nplease continue\nmister scott you have accomplished your task\nfor what purpose mister scott\nwhat is it in you humans\nthat requires an overwhelming display of emotion in a situation such as this two men pursue the only reasonable course of action indicated and yet you\nfeel that something else is necessary\ni had the same misgivings about you were turned and picked up your life form readings only a moment ago\nfrom where this brain had the power to send the enterprise nine hundred and ninety points even light years across the galaxy what a remarkable culture this is\ni surmised that captain its moves were immensely logical but what people created this are there any representatives here\nthat is a loss captain\nto do the job of defence the computer projected a replica of the only image available los iras\nbeauty is transitory doctor however she was evidently highly intelligent\nindeed captain\nwhat kind of earthquakes do they have in this place\nits gone the enterprise its gone\nthe enterprise must have blown up that would explain the high radiation readings wouldnt it captain if the matter antimatter engines\nonce in siberia there was a meteor so great that it flattened whole forests and was felt as far away as\naye sir\nyes captain all vegetation is inedible poison to us\naye sir\nsulu to captain\ncaptain i was making a standard magnetic sweep from zero i suddenly got a reading that was off the scale then a reverse of polarity and now i get nothing ive never seen anything like this reading like a door opened and then closed again\npoor damato what a terrible way to die\nthats the

basic substance of this planet is an alloy of di burn ium osmium it couldnt have evolved naturally\nbut captain where are the people who made it why cant we see them\nill take the first watch sir\naye sir\nwho are you\nhow do you know this where did you get this information are you from this planet\nthen the planet is hollow who killed lieutenant damato allright the captain will want to talk to you

price of your survival is too high\nyou cant have her your e entitled to your own life but not an others\nthey ll be forced to accept it\nwe must get her into the pressure chamber\nsecure the chamber neutralise gravity\npressurise the unit bring pressure to two atmospheres and then increase one atmosphere per second continue increasing pressure pressure spock pressure\ncontinue spock\npressure\nbones are you able to judge the long range effects on lieutenant romaine\nwould either of you credit scotty s steadfast belief in her as a factor\ndoi take it both of you agree that lieutenant romaine need not return to starbase for further treatment\ncaptain kirk to mister scott\nmister scott hows lieutenant romaine\nyes mister scott doi take it you say that she is fit for duty\nthank you kirk to bridge\nmister sulu set course for memory alpha lieutenant romaine has a lot of work to do there\nwell this is an enterprise first doctor mccoy mister spock and engineer scott

readings corresponding nurse\nthank you\nlieutenant there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this ship your e the only one that passed out and i want to know why\nthis whole thing is a new experience for all of us\nwell if we can get on with this scotty we might make that determination now then tell me what did you feel before you passed out\nnothing\nlieutenant\nlieutenant your e being completely uncooperative\nill put the facts into your record if i can get them\nperhaps you can explain to her that any careers he hopes for in starfleet requires discipline and cooperation\nmccoy here jim\ni think she sin good shape\nsomehow i find transporting into the darkness unnerving\nover here captain\nnot a thing jim the same garbled sounds lieutenant romaine made when she fainted after the storm\nabsolutely sure\nshes dead\nsevere brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural systems dissolution of autonomic nervous system all basic personality factors captain\neach had a different centre of brain destroyed cause unknown\nyes captain i can be more detailed when we return to the ship and use the ships computers\nwe found one person in there just barely alive the rest were dead and we\nyes captain\ni can have her ready in a few minutes\ngo easy on her jim shes in a pretty bad state\nof course you didnt i told the captain\nromaine mira lieutenant place of birth martian colony number three parents lydia romaine deceased jacques romaine chief engineer starfleet retired\nyes captain\noccasional and teenage routine incidents\nnone\nno captain not empathic however an extremely flexible and pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked\nafter our phaser shit that thing i gave lieutenant romaine a standard steinman analysis the results might be interesting\nthe comparison of our steinman with starfleet records shows that lieutenant romaine s fingerprints voice analysis all external factors remain exactly the same as before however according to two hyper ence p halo grams her brainwave pattern has been altered\nthats what i was taught but the is just as consistent as fingerprints\nthats right spock but exceptional pli ancy was indicated that might be a factor\nyes mister spock that is tape deck d brain circuitry pattern of lieutenant mira romaine\nnurse chapel followed this every step of the way there can be no error\nthere has been no error\nshe could kill us all in this state\nthe girls life reading is becoming a match to the zet arians shes losing\njim you realize the pressure needed to kill the zeta rs might kill the girl too\nthe zeta rs are growing stronger\nthe pressure is dangerously high captain it may damage her\nweve done it jim theyre gone\nreduce the pressure very very gradually spock\nlie perfectly still lieutenant try not to move at all take deep regular breath snow dont hold it continue to breathe deeply in out in out thats it now you ll be in there another twenty minutes so why dont you just try to relax\nwhen the personality of a human is involved exact predictions are hazardous\nhowever despite starfleet judgment of the pli ancy of the lieutenant she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity and i find that encouraging\nthere are no however s about it mister spock it was a factor and it will be a factor in the girls recovery\nwell i should think work would be a better therapy\nanything else\nwere ready sir\nthank you\ni mim fine\nim fine doctor really i am is everybody else all right\nwhy i feel\nyes sir\nwhats that you redoing nurse\nbut why i havent had a single

if we stay\ni tell you t will kill us\ni saw those men dead in their exact positions\nno scotty\nnever\nive always believed it\nthen what is it scotty whats frightening me ever since that storm hit ive ive had such strange thoughts such feelings of terror\nthen i dont have to report it\nhelp scotty\nhold me its happening again no\nno scotty no no\nscotty\ni didnt mean to be uncooperative doctor\nill tell you everything i know\ni trust all of you implicitly i want to help\nyou must nt worry about hurting me\nyes there was one other time\ni saw scotty\ni dont know\nhe was dying now i

quite a fall\naye they are now you just do what doctor mccoy ordered\ncaptain would it be all right if i went along to sickbay\nbut captain\nshe might have something there doctor mccoy this is her first deep space trip and you know that affects people\ncome on now mira we must help the doctor tell us what happened\nim sure thats what the lieutenant wants she just didnt understand did you now lass\noh you will not thats ridiculous this getting used to space travel that takes some doing and not everybody takes to it\nwell me thats different i was practically born to it\nyou will you passed your starfleet preliminary examinations and this is just getting used to what you might call your space legs\nscott here\nin the sickbay\noch noi was just checking on the lass shes going to be fine now theres nothing wrong with her\nim afraid this light ll have to do captain the generator is inoperative\ncaptain\nmira the captain has some questions\nwait captain weve lost mira\nstabilise her\nlet me\nlisten to me ive told you what strange tricks a space trip can play on your mind now thats all it is\nhave you ever had visions of the future events before this\nwell if you ask me nobody ever has that seeing to the future its pure bunk you know that dont you\nand you were perfectly right\nspace space thats all it is\nwell if you want to spend the rest of the trip in sickbay but what good would that do doctor mccoy can no more cure it than he can a cold\nwhat\nmira\nmira\nmira mira\ncaptain captain the phaser shots theyre killing mira\naye when you fired the phasers they stunned her and she crumpled\nanother shot and youll kill her\nmira has tried to tell me all along that she was seeing things in advance\nyou dont report space sickness thats all i thought it was\nthe first attack on the ship the attack on memory alpha and the time we nearly lost her\nand and\ni thought for a moment there was something else but i guess i was wrong\nweve lost her to them\nstay with us mira please stay\nyou wont let them\nmira mira captain\nmira will not kill me\ni told you she wouldnt kill me\nits all right mira theyre gone theyre gone\nnow we have all the time in the world\nscott

area of the brain was affected our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure\nattack might be a more precise formulation captain\nit is of little consequence captain memory alpha has no protective shields\nnone captain when the library complex was assembled shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose since the information on the memory planet is available to everyone special protection was deemed unnecessary\nit varies with the number of scholars researchers and scientists from the various federation planets who are using the computer complex\nsensors give no readings of generated energy from memory alpha captain\nnone\na disaster for the galaxy captain the central brain is damaged the memory core is burned out the loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable\na very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity captain\nnegative\nthe attack was thorough\nlieutenant i assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet it is probably seeking other victims\nno known conditions in space would support that type of natural phenomenon\nim having difficulty with the ships sensors they seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants of memory alpha were\nships sensors are operating at the moment perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself\nnegative captain maintaining its distance however it is matching each manoeuvre we execute and i am receiving increasing magnitude of energy\nnot what is it captain what are they there are ten distinct life units within it all powerfully alive and vital\nimpossible to determine without programming for computer analysis\ni do not believe the enterprise shields would prove an effective defence\ncaptain we are dealing with a community of life units their attack is in the form of brainwaves directed against the brain which is most compatible\nperhaps it did not understand\nit appears so\nnot directly\nnegative captain i have not been able to gather sufficient data for that captain there is only one possible defence if we can find an environment which is deadly to the alien form\ni am captain i have fed all obtainable data to the main computer it should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible\ndoctor mccoy according to your records lieutenant romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers\nand you are sure that this is the correct slide\ngentlemen it also happens to be tape h the impulse tracking obtained from the alien life units\nas i said captain this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run computer run a detailed comparison brain circuitry patterns taped and tape h\nfascinating\ndoctor mccoy is correct captain there is an identity of minds taking place between the alien beings and the mind of lieutenant romaine their thoughts are becoming hers\nat their present force they will get through the shields this time captain\nshe will unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned\ncaptain we must deal with them directly now while she still retains partial identity we can speak to them they will answer using her voice\nthat is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed\nthey will not accept their own deaths\ncaptain if we can not complete the plan they will carry out their threat\nthe weightless state has become their natural condition\nwe may tax mister scotts patience doctor\nparticularly where humans are involved doctor\ndoctor mccoy is correct captain while the truth was difficult to accept when it was revealed the girl reacted well i would say her struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure\nyou mean love as motivation humans do claim a great deal for that particular emotion i suppose it is possible however\nlogical\ni dont think he seven noticed she has a brain\ncaptain im picking up a high intensity reading\nno sir an engineer touches scotts arm to attract his

come here\nhas she injured you captain\noh\nsend a sentinel to the rest chamber immediately\nyou talk like a disrupter vanna\nbut stratos is for advisors and studier s what would trog lyte s do here\nthe caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to light just as your minds are not accustomed to logic\nthe tro gly tes are workers captain oh surely you must be aware of that they mine zenit e for shipment till the soil those things can not be done here\nthat is their function in our society\nhow can they share what they do not understand\nthe complete separation of toil and leisure has given ar dana this perfectly balanced social system captain why should we change it\nthe surface is marred by violence like the trog lyte s but here in stratos we have completely eliminated violence\nbut what else can they understand mister spock\nno father\nno really im not upset i was just standing here looking into space and wondering whether or not he would return\nbut the zenit eis so important to him he must have it\nby that time it may be too late perhaps he does have a method\nno i wasnt thinking of captain kirk its the one with those exquisitely shaped ears his name is spock hes the one i was thinking about did you know that he has the most incredibly sensitive hearing why i almost believe that if i stood here and called out to him he would hear my invitation to come and visit with us for a little while longer\nshall we try\nthey are desperate\nim sure mister spock would not be have so\nfather are we so sure of our methods that we never question what we do\ni dont like filters or even masks i like the word protector much better dont you\nstratos is so pleasant and so beautiful i think im afraid to leave it\ni shall go to the mines i no longer wish to be limited to the clouds is your planet like this one\nsomeday i should like to visit it\nat federation orders were proceeding at top warp speed to the planet ar dana where the only source of zenit e exists it is the one substance that can halt the plague\non stratos thats their cloud city isnt it mister spock\nthere must be some mistake do you have the coordinates to the mine entrance available\nkirk to transporter room\nmister scott are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city stratos\nfine uhura tell the high advisor that we request to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency and that were beaming directly down to the mine entrance in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenit e the need is urgent\nmister spock come with me oh and tell them that we appreciate the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future\nlooks as tranquil as its reputation doesnt it\nonce i didnt have time to look around\nyes art is the populations chief occupation\ntheres the mine entrance the zenit e consignment should have been there i dont understand it those trog lyte miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down\nperhaps\nwho are you whats the meaning of this attack\nwere here by permission of your government council on an emergency mission\nno just a little shaken up\ncaptain kirk enterprise my first officer mister spock\nit was rather warm\nwell im more concerned with the zenit e consignment why wasnt it in its specified location\nthey agreed to the delivery your council assured us of it\nhostages for what purpose\nvery well i do hope the search will be brief mister advisor\npleasure madam\nwhat are their demands\ni must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenit eto merak two\ni hope soar dana is a member of the federation and it is your councils responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to another member of the federation\nyou again\nyes duty is a good teacher i see youve changed your dressmaker\nso you can attack me again that would be foolish\nim not afraid in fact i find this rather enjoyable\nall right ill make a deal with you you answer some questions and ill let you up\nyour word first\nspock\nthen why this\nno not at all in fact her visit was quite enlightening\nyes it seems the tro gly tes are under the impression that the enterprise is here to intimidate them\nwere here to get that zenit e consignment and thats it\nin times of emergency they do anything and believe me this botanical plague is an emergency\nunaccustomed to light and warmth thats necessary to all humanoids surely you dont deny it to the trog lyte s\nthey can be taught to understand especially in a society that prides itself in enlightenment\nyes i should have realised\nmister advisor\nyou said you were going to question vanna not torture her\nsurely there are better methods than this\nyes but i wont standby while someone is tortured\nthe abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to vanna\nbut obviously no more consideration\nthe only way youll use that device again is on one of us\nof course but starfleet command wont take kindly to having either rays or physical force used against one of its command personnel mister advisor\nbeyond plain humanitarianism my orders are to get that zenit e\nyou wont get it through torture\nkirk to enterprise\nmister scott were ready to beam up\nlieutenant uhura advise starfleet command that the zenit e has not been delivered in my opinion plas us method of accomplishing delivery will not succeed if the zenit e is not delivered shortly i shall have to violate plas us order of noninterference and win the confidence of the trog lyte leader with the use of reason\nthats impossible bones the trog lyte s have accepted personal sacrifice a common cause mentally inferior beings arent capable of that\nnatural growths what kind\nand the mines are full of that gas\nbones the disrupters vanna it seems impossible theyve outwitted a highly organised scientific culture for months\ndoes the brain return to normal\ncan you neutralise the gas\nfind one meet us in the transporter room\nthis mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to humanoid life chemical as well as bacterial we have used these filter masks frequently on\ndoctor mccoy has analysed the zenit e thoroughly weve checked his findings through the computer and theyre absolutely valid\ntheres no time to argue about the findings now i simply propose to tell vanna all about them\nthis nonsense might mean a great deal to the tro gly tesi would like to offer them a supply of these filter masks in exchange for the zenit e consignment\nare you afraid the filter masks will work is that why you dont want the tro gly testo try them\ni am here to get that zenit e if these will help me get the mill use them\nmy diplomacy is somewhat inadequate\ndoesnt give us much choice does it\nbeam me down to vann as confinement quarters\nif vanna doesnt have something definite to gain for her people shell die rather than turnover that zenit e consignment this is the only thing that might convince her\nif youre about to suggest that you contact vanna the answer is negative spock that goes for you too bones\nofficially yes but this mission is strictly unofficial nobodys to have any part in it any responsibility for it but myself that san order spock you have the conn standby till i contact you\nvan naive brought you a gift theres a dangerous gas in the mines that affects the development of the trog lyte s exposed to it for a period of time this mask will prevent any further damage\nyes\nthats true but an idea cant be seen or felt thats what s kept the tro gly tes in the mines all these centuries a mistaken idea\nyes ill see to it that the federation engineers construct them\nplas us is not the whole government\nas soon as the zenit e is delivered to merak two ill come back ill request permission to mediate for the trog lyte sv anna you must trust me i give you my word\nthe zenit e can be delivered in a few hours you wont have long to wait now\nvanna you must trust me if you dont millions of people will die a whole planet this zenit eis all that can save them this filter mask is all that can save the trog lyte s trust me please\nwe had a bargain why did you break it\ni trusted you\nthen you are a fool these masks will free you just as i said\nholding me wont help you my men ll still come for that zenit e consignment\ntheyll still come\nwithout that mask i havent\nit takes a while for its effects to be noticed\nis that what disrupters are bargaining for the right to kill everyone\nthe masks can change that\nhow long do you plan on keeping me here providing mid ro doesnt kill me of course\nthats quite a while longer than i expected\ncompletely\ndie from something that cant be seen you astound me vanna kirk to enterprise enterprise come in kirk to enterprise enterprise come in kirk to enterprise\nnothing are you locked in on me\ncircumstances dictate a slight variation spock\nhold on these coordinates locate the high advisor and beam him to these coordinates immediately without advance communication repeat without advance communication have you got that spock\ni am preparing a demonstration on the effects of un believed gas\nnot until your e convinced of the effects of the zenit eg as mister advisor\nperhaps you need closer exposure fill that container\ni insist\nyou too vanna you too dig kirk here what is it\nyour orders are to stand by now carry them out kirk out\nwell leave when the gas has effect\ndig\ni said dig\none more step and ill kill you\nboth will kill\nthe zenit eg as\nwell it seems my little demonstration was quite a success\nthey will be very effective sir they ve been severely tested and the tro gly tes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties\nthank you vanna\nperhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties the federation bureau of industrialisation maybe of aid to you\nbelieve me siri have neither the time nor the desire to return here only answering your charges against me will force me back\nyour e guilty of attacking a starship commander and plotting against his life\nyes vanna they never happened mister advisor mister spock lets get that zenit e

medical analysis indicates the tro gly tes are mentally inferior\nlook ive checked my findings thoroughly their intellect ratings are almost twenty percent below average\nthats true spock but obviously the ancestors of those who live on stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines therefore they avoided the effects of certain natural growths\nwell i had this zenit e sample sent up from the surface now unsealed it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here\nthere are none after its refined but in its raw state item its a odourless invisible gas that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional therefore it releases a violent reaction\nthats right and the tro gly tes are constantly exposed to it\nthats right spock the other disrupters were probably removed from exposure too\naccording to findings it should\nno but a filter mask should remove the exposure\ntheres every indication that the effect of the gas is temporary even after repeated exposure\nbut that could take days\nits pretty hard to overcome prejudice\nyou mean you re going back to stratos against government orders\ncan the zenit e be affecting him\nlookout jim\nvanna\nwhat of him\nif we kill him there will be no need to see\nonly the tro gly tes will know\nyou are not the only disrupter i too can say\nwhen anka returns we will all say\ntrog

habitual with the trog lyte s but i assure you this insult will not go unpunished\napparently the disrupters have confiscated it as i knew they would\na small group of trog lyte malcontents all the other tro gly tes are completely dominated by them its the disrupters who are responsible for their refusal to continue mining for zenit e\nthey agreed obviously as a ruse to get valuable hostages\nto force the council to meet their demands organise a search party immediately and find the zenit e consignment\nmeanwhile captain i would suggest that you and first officer spock be our guests on stratos\nwell do everything possible to make it so come gentlemen\na most gracious act one of our planets most incomparable works of art my daughter dro xine captain james kirk\nand first officer spock\ncome gentlemen there is much to see in our city this is our council gallery it is open to all city dwellers we have some of the finest of our various art forms assembled here for the viewing

concerned with\ni assure you gentlemen you will get what you came for\nof course and we accept the responsibility\nart means nothing to the disrupters this is the only form they understand the disturbances accompanying your arrival have been most wearying no doubt you would like to rest\nchambers have been prepared for you a sentinel will guide you to them\nits fortunate that they were not seriously hurt\nfurther violence could create grave difficulties between ar dana and the federation\nthey grow more daring and determined everyday now they seek to find allies in the galaxy\nall this

permit where is it\ndid you also forget your transport card\nand where was your cavern implement lost could this perhaps be it\nand you shall make them by giving us the names of the disrupters\ni would advise you to increase your knowledge\nsecure him to the rostrum\nhow unfortunate how unfortunate\nyou still refuse to disclose the names of the other disrupters\nvery well if you prefer the rays\nshes stubborn and as you yourself pointed out captain the search for your zenit e consignment must be short\nphysical discomfort is extremely persuasive captain\nis it preferable to spare vanna and allow an entire planet to be destroyed\ntro gly tes are not like stratos dwellers mister spock theyre a conglomerate of inferior species the abstract concepts of an intellectual society are beyond their comprehension\na few tro gly tes are brought here as retainers vanna was one of them as are the sentinels theyve received more training than the others\ni fail to see the purpose of this continued criticism\nan imposing display of primitive gallantry gentlemen you realise of course that the sentinels could remove you\nwhy are you so concerned with this disrupters wellbeing\nthen stop interfering and ill get it for you\nwe will get it for you and in our own way remove the prisoner to confinement quarters you will return to your ship at once or is hall contact your starfleet command myself and report your interference with this planets government\nif captain kirk appears again kill him captains log stardate 58190 more than eight hours have passed since the consignment of zenit e

failed to do\nand do your computers explain how my ancestors who also dwelt in caverns evolved sufficiently to erect stratos while the trog lyte s did not\npreposterous\ni doubt whether even vanna will believe such nonsense\nim sorry captain such an offer could only cause more unrest among them i can not allow it until our scientists have checked the findings\nyou are here to complete an

planet is a place of the most violent contrasts those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens it is not a wise leadership here on stratos everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant the high advisors charming daughter dro xine particularly so the name dro xine seems appropriate for her i wonder can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet there the harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred the young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was filled with the violence of desperation if the lovely dro xine knew of the young miners misery i wonder how the knowledge would affect her\nyour movements awakened me\nonly vulcan ears would find the noise discernible\nthe same may be said of stratos inhabitants\nwe do pride ourselves on our logic\nthe seven year cycle is biologically inherent in all vulcans at that time the mating drive outweighs all other motivations\nextreme feminine beauty is always disturbing madam\nami intruding captain\nin other words they perform all the physical to il necessary to maintain stratos\nbut they are not allowed to share its advantages\nthe surface of the planet is almost unendurable to restrict a segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved culture\ntrog lyte

and expect from life such as equality kindness justice\nbut they re all the same species those who live on stratos and those who live below all originated on the planet their physical and mental evolution must be similar that is basic biological law\nincredible zenit e is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria no side effects have ever been reported\nas part of

so right\nwhere the devil are they\njimi would be the last to advise you on your command image\ndo i have to lay it out for you practically the entire crew has seen you treat this impostor like the real thing when he cant possibly be the real article\nyour e the science officer why arent you well doing whatever a science officer does at a time like this\nat last at least somebody agrees with us hes an alien\nmad loony as an arc turi an dog bird\nyes a big one suddenly miraculously we see a small spot of earth type environment down there now is it really there or do we just think we see it down there\nare you implying mister spock that its probably safe to be am down there\nbut he holds a special involvement to you jimi think its interesting inasmuch as your e the one who s going to make the decision whether to beam down or not\nyour e both out of your heads\nwould ibe on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain that this smells of something happening to him that i might not be able to patch together again\nif they re wrong and they do beam into a pool of lava\nscotty\nif they re all right they should ve reported in\nat least the captain and spock are safe\ncan we beam the captain and spock backup\nwell can we send the phasers down\nbut theyre not real any more than that lincoln or sur ak what do the sensors read\ncould they be aliens projecting an illusion\nyoull have an answer soon captain our world is called exc albia countless who live on that planet are watching before this drama unfolds we give welcome to the ones named kirk and spock\nyour e intelligent life form but im surprised you do not perceive the honour we do you have we not created in this place on our planet a stage identical to your own world\nyour objection is well taken we shall communicate with your vessel so your fellow life forms may also enjoy and profit from the play behold\ncaptain mister spock some of these you may know through history genghis khan for one and colonel green who led a genocidal war early in the 21st century on earth zora who experimented with the body chemistry of subject tribes on tiburon kahless the unforgettable the klingon who set the pattern for his planets tyrannies we welcome the vessel enterprise\nto our solar system and to our spectacle\nwe ask you to observe with us\nthe confrontation of the two opposing philosophies you term good and evil since this is our first experiment with earthlings our theme is a simple one survival life and death your philosophies are alien to us and we wish to understand them and discover which is the stronger we learn by observing such spectacles\nthe word is explicit if you and spock survive you return to your vessel if you do not your existence is ended\nwhy do you hesitate\ndo you wish further clarification your choice of action is unlimited as is your choice of weapons should you wish to use any you may fabricate anything you desire out of what you can find around you captain\nyou will decide otherwise\ni am disappointed you display no interest in the honour we do you we offer you an opportunity to become our teachers by demonstrating whether good or evil is more powerful you find my body heat distressing captain you forget the nature of this planet i must conclude that your species requires a cause to fight for you may now communicate with your ship\nthe estimate is quite correct your ship will blow itself to bits within four hours captain unless you defeat the others before then is that cause enough to fight for\nto save your ship and your crew you have to win\nyour communicators no longer function captain you may proceed with the spectacle\nyou are the survivors the others have runoff it would seem that evil retreats when forcibly confronted however you have failed to demonstrate to me any other difference between your philosophies your good and your evil use the same methods achieve the same results do you have an explanation\nfor you to use as you chose\nwhat they wanted most power\ni perceive you have won their lives\nthe same right that brought you here the need to know new things\nand you may go in peace\nfull dress presidential honours what is this nonsense mister dickerson\nha your e daft man\nid have expected sanity from the ships surgeon at least president lincoln indeed no doubt to be followed by louis of france and robert the bruce\naye sir\nlocked onto something does that appear human to you mister spock\nwe can be amita board any time now sir\nyou heard mister spock yourself mineral he called it like living rock\ni couldnt tell it may have been another figure down there standing by what do you make of it\nwhy they re probably looking up a plate of haggis in the galley they ve been everywhere else\nlincoln died three centuries ago on a planet hundreds of light years away\nmad loony as an arc turi an dog bird\nyou might be am down into a sea of molten lava\ndont do it captain\naye sir\naye\ntransporter room to bridge standing by\nthen they re dead men i could na pull them back in time\ncome in landing party report enterprise to captain kirk can you read us\nhow is it mister sulu\nshutdown all but the most necessary systems\nengage restart cycle\nstart emergency procedures\nits a confrontation of some sort those are all figures out of history notoriously evil\nwe dont have the power theyll come aboard a mass of dying flesh\ntheres nothing we can do doctor nothing but watch them hes skimmed the worst ones in history to face them\nscott to engineering report lieutenant\ngive me that again mani can not hear you\nengineering check for radiation get a repair crew on it at once\nis there a danger of detonation\ncaptain\ni can not we have a complete power failure\nwere on emergency battery power only\ni cant explain it sir but the matter and antimatter are in redzone proximity\ntheres no knowing and theres no stopping it either the shielding is breaking down i estimate four hours before it goes completely four hours before the ship blows up\nthe ship is functioning normally again sir and the restart cycle is in operation you d never know anything had been out of order i cant fathom it\ni still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the planet surface captain\nagreed mister sulu switch to the planet area i have under observation\nwhich would indicate a considerable civilisation there\nour readings could be false captain perhaps caused by some natural phenomena\nwere being scanned captain a deep probe incredibly swift\nfascinating\nthey did scan us and our vessel captain and doubtless obtained sufficient information to present this illusion\nsmall change occurring there captain\nan area of approximately one thousand square kilometres it measures completely earth like\nfascinating for a moment it appeared almost mineral like living rock with heavy fore claws its settling down now to completely human readings\nband honours ready captain\nwe do sir six hundred forty three miles two thousand twenty one feet two point zero four inches at this moment using your old style measurements\nit is basic to the vulcan philosophy sir the combination of a number of things to make existence worthwhile\nmore that direction engineer\ni am doctor i am observing the alien\nit would be illogical with such abilities they could as easily trick us into destroying the entire vessel\nno im not doctor theres no doubt they want us down there for some hidden purpose otherwise they would have revealed some logical reason for all of this\nspeculation is unnecessary captain the answer is clear president lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you what better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for you\nagreed i too experienced his charm it is a magnificent work of duplication\ncaptain since i was included in the invitation to make contact i must beam down with you\ncaptain our phasers and tricorder s did not beam down with us\nundamaged yet something is preventing them from functioning\nsur ak\nthe greatest of all who ever lived on our planet captain the father of all we became\nit is not logical that you are sur ak there is no fact extrapolation of factor theory which would make possible\nlive long and prosper image of sur ak father of all we now hold true\nas i turned and my eyes be held you i displayed emotion i beg forgiveness\nit may be exactly as explained captain our concept of good and evil is strange to them perhaps they wish to determine which is strongest\nim all right captain however i suggest that we prepare ourselves for another attack\nand if they re real captain\nyes captain\ncaptain logic dictates that we consider another course\nhis convictions are most profound in this matter captain\nthe captain knows that i have fought a this side before and will do so now if need be however i too am a vulcan bred to peace let him attempt it\ni deeply respect what he has accomplished\ntheyre trying to go ad us into attacking captain they expect us to act rashly\nhe was aware of what might happen when he went\nyou had no choice captain you could not have stopped him\na vulcan would not cry out so\ni am not insensitive to it captain\ncaptain that is what they are waiting for theyre waiting for us to attempt a rescue\nno sir\nconjecture captain rather than explanation\nit would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was desired so they were able to create images of sur ak and lincoln after scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter\nyes and sur ak perhaps in a sense they were real captain since they were created out of our own thoughts how could they be anything but what we expected them to be\nall observation stations take final readings this ll be our last orbit\nim reading it now mister spock

wisely those four are not our enemy we should arrive together at a peaceful settlement\nin my time on vulcan we also faced these same alternatives wed suffered devastating wars which nearly destroyed our planet another was about to begin we were torn but out of our suffering some of us found the discipline to act we sent emissaries to our opponents to propose peace the first were killed but others

you\nthe facts as you know them or did you just accept zara beth sword because its what you wanted to believe\nzara beth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness she would do anything to anybody to change that wouldnt you zara beth\ndid you you said we cant get back the truth is you cant get back\nshe would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness she would lie she would cheats he would even murder me the captain the entire crew of the enterprise to keep you here with her go ahead zara beth tell spock the truth go ahead tell spock you would kill\nare you trying to kill me spock is that what you really want think what are you feeling rage jealousy have you ever had those feelings before\nthe vulcan you knew wont exist for another five thousand years think man whats happening on your planet right now this very moment\nwho nearly killed themselves off with their own passions spock your e reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you were born\ni

captain\nyou ve got to come aboard now\norders or no im beaming you up first\nnow or never captain\nthe power source we detected is in this building captain\nno signs of sapient life forms\nreports deny that they had any spaceflight capability this appears to be an archive or library of some kind\nforgive me sir it is my fault i must have miscalculated our readings indicated that there was no one here at all\nthree hours thirteen minutes\nexactly what is it that im expected to select\ni see this is a fascinating machine what is it\ninteresting nomenclature how does it work may i\nthank you mister atoz\nyes and where is the captain\nheating this boulder may provide some temporary heat\nsome things preventing my phaser from operating\ncaptain we hear you but we can not see you\nare you all right\nagreed\napparently theyve all escaped the destruction of their world by retreating into its past\nindeed not were in a wilderness of arctic characteristics\nthere is no library captain at least not that we can see we are at the base of a nice cliff\njust before you disappeared captain i discovered a machine which mister atoz called the ata va chron\nopening time portals to the past you cross through into the period which you were viewing\ni am here evidently because i stepped through at the same instant as doctor mccoy\ncaptain\nyou must be close to the portal keep talking now\nwe may be in trouble ourselves we must find shelter\nin this severe cold we can not survive much longer\nwe go together or not at all\nwe go together\nhes suffering from the severity of your weather unfortunately he is the doctor not i ill avoid giving him any medication at this time perhaps if he s kept quiet and warm he may recover naturally it is agreeably warm here\nim called spock\nprisoners\nyes we came through the time portal but not as prisoners we were sent here by mistake\nthat is true i am not from the world you know at all my home is a planet millions of light years away\nlisten to me i am firmly convinced that i do exist i am substantial you are not imagining this\nmccoy mccoy wake up\nno we are still in the ice age but safe for the moment\ndoctor your ein no condition to get up you lie down and rest is hall attempt to find the captain\nhe sour commanding officer and our friend\nhe did not come with us he was sent through the time portal to another period in history much later than this one if i am to find him there is only one possible avenue zara beth will you show me where the time portal is\nyes that is true if i leave him theres a chance he may never regain the ship he would then be marooned in this time period but he is no longer in danger of death so my primary duty to him has been discharged if i remain here no one of our party would be able to aid captain kirk\nit should be an equation i should be able to resolve this problem logically perhaps it has something to do with the ata va chron if only i knew more about how it worked zara beth you said that you were brought here as a prisoner may i ask\ni remember that name from the history tapes in the library z or kahn the tyrant\nzara beth i must return to mister atoz and the ata va chron we will carry doctor mccoy and you must come with us i will send you and the doctor to the ship and is hall search for captain kirk\nyou can not go back\ncome doctor back to bed\nit is impossible to look for him doctor we can not go back\nzara beth explained it to me when we came through the time portal it altered our physiological structure if we attempt to return to the library we shall die\nyes doctor we are trapped just as jim is trapped wherever he is captains log stardate 59439 the people of this time believe in witches and witchcraft is what ive been accused of five witnesses heard mccoys voice speak to me and thought it was an evil spirit from what i know of witchcraft trials i dont have much chance unless i can get to the prosecutor\nreally\ndoctor mccoy is making excellent progress\nand known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the enterprise\nfive thousand years in the future\nwho knows we can only hope that he is well wherever he is\nwhat was there to do\nwe ve been through all that doctor whats the point of rehashing that subject we cant get back wasnt that clear to you\nthen perhaps you were too ill to understand what cant get back means\nthen ill repeat it for you get this through your head we cant get back that means we are trapped here in this planets past just as we are and well stay here for the rest of our lives now do you understand\nthe prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago\ni dont like that i dont think i ever did and now im sure\nnothing that shouldnt have happened long ago\nim sorry i know of no way to return you to your own time\nyes i know what it is like\nif it pleases you this is animal flesh\nnaturally because of the climate what is the source of heat in the shelter\nexcellent then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of sorts meanwhile this will have to do as the only source of nourishment\nbut he evidently intended that you continue living\nbut insensitive to send such a beautiful woman into exile the cold must ve affected me more than i realised please pay no attention im not myself im be having disgracefully i have eaten animal flesh and i have enjoyed it what is wrong with me i tell you youre beautiful but you are beautiful is it so wrong to tell you so\nyou are beautiful more beautiful than any dream of beauty ive ever known\nive given you the facts doctor\nyou were told the truth if zara beth is the source what difference does it make\nshe would not jeopardise other lives\nwhat are you doing to her\nthis is impossible impossible i am a vulcan\nmy ancestors are barbarians warlike barbarians\nive lost myself i do not know who i am can we go back\ntheres no portal here doctor its hopeless\nyour e too ill to remain out here any longer give it up\nwe hear you perfectly captain\nthis must be it\nyou start ahead doctor i do not wish to part from you\nhow much time do we have\ntheres no further need to observe me doctor as you can see ive returned to the present in every sense\nyes it happened but that was five thousand years ago and she is dead now dead and buried long ago\nyou dirty thing let go of me\noh thank you man i thought id be limber ed sure when that gull caught me cutting his purse\noh i took you to be an angler but your e none of us are ya well youre a bully fine coe for all of that what a handsome dish ya served

head come on love i know a leech who ll ask no questions\nmercy on us its spirits\nits spirits\nhe saw it ch\nhe speaks to unseen spirit she saw it ch you heard the voices\nyour e a witch he cast a spell he made me steal against my wish\nwitch witch witch theyll burn ya\nwhat are you called\neven your name is strange forgive me ive never seen anyone who looks like you why are you here are you prisoners too\nthis is one of the places z or kahn sends people when he wants them to disappear didnt you come in through the time portal\nthe ata va chronis far away but i think you come from someplace farther than that\noh how wonderful ive always loved books about such possibilities but they are only stories this isnt real i must be imagining all this im going mad\noh ive been here for

bones help me dont let them lock me away from you ive got to talk to you\nyes thats what it must ve been\nit was accomplished and forgotten long ago on camus two i am a living example\nnevertheless spock it is the truth im speaking kirk is being bathed in coloured light with his eyes closed\nspock when i was caught in the interspace of the tho lian sector you risked your life and the enterprise to get me back help me get back now when the via ns of minar a demanded that we let bones die we didnt permit it\nyou are closer to the captain than anyone in the universe you know his thoughts what does your telepathic mind tell you now\nno i am not captain kirk that is very apparent i claim that whatever it is that makes james kirk a living being special to himself is being held here in this body\nthats very clever but i didnt say it is aid the body of james kirk is being used by doctor janice lester\nno it was brought about by a violent attack by doctor lester and the use of equipment she discovered on camus two\nyes to get the power she craved to attain a positions he doesnt merit by temperament or training and most of all she wanted to murder james kirk a man who once loved her but her intense hatred of her own womanhood made life with her impossible\nfor a moment i thought that i was upon the bridge\nwell if it happens again ill fight to stay there\noh hive lost to the captain ive lost to james kirk i want you dead i want you dead i want you dead o him never going to be the captain never kill him\nkill him\nwhats wrong with her\njanice you must remain absolutely quiet those are doctors orders not mine\ni dont blame you\ni never stopped you from going on with your space work\nno it isnt and you punished and tortured me because of it\nwed have killed each other\nyou had your chance captain kirk you should ve smothered the life in me then they would have said doctor janice lester died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty why didnt you do it you always wanted to didnt you you had the strength to do it but you were afraid you were always afraid now janice lester takes the place of captain kirk i already possess your physical strength only this captain kirk is not afraid to kill now you know the indignity of being a woman for you this agony will soon pass as it has for me quiet quiet believe me its better to be dead than to live alone in the body of a woman its better to be dead\ndoctor mccoy your report\nwas it radiation as suggested\nno nothing at all she was unconscious all of the time\nperhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part of her problem\ncaptain kirk to the enterprise captain kirk to the enterprise\nmister scott prepare to beam the landing party aboard plus two others one critically ill have a medical

yes its been a long time since i saw her i walked out on her when it became serious\nyouth doesnt excuse everything doctor mccoy its a very unhappy memory for me\nthank you thankyouverymuch\nyes very lucky very lucky\nwell you d better put a stop to it if you allow doctor lester to become fully conscious shell know what has happened\nprobably\ni tell you it cant continue\nthere was nt enough time\nhe hung on to life too hard i couldnt\nlove him i love the life he led the power of a starship commander its my life now\nyou are a murderer you knew it was celeb ium you could ve treated them for it youre a murderer many times over\ni thought my presence might quiet doctor lester it seems to have had the opposite effect\ndidnt doctor lester s staff become delirious before they went off and died\ndoctor coleman doctor mccoy has had a great deal of experience with radiation exposure onboard the enterprise i am guided by his opinion\ndoctor mccoy im sorry but im going to have to take you off the case and turn it over to doctor coleman\ndoctor coleman wants to assume the full responsibility let him do it\nits done doctor coleman your patient doctor coleman didnt you suggest a sedation to rest the patient\ndoctor coleman\njames kirk is returning to consciousness in the body of janice lester the enterprise is proceeding to its next mission on the course set before i took over command now the years i spent studying every single detail of the ships operation will be tested with a little experience i will be in vulnerable to suspicion at last i attain what is my just due command of a starship all the months of preparation now come to fruition\ncourse mister chekov\nmister sulu set speed at warp factor two\nmister chekov plot a course for the bene cia colony\nhow long to the colony at our present speed\nmister sulu set course for the colony three seven three mark eight\nyes it cant be helped we must take doctor lester to a place where she can be treated\nhow long to starbase two\nits twenty four hours too long doctor lester s condition is increasingly serious continue present course\nthey will have to serve\nthank you mister spock but the facilities will be of little use if doctor lester s dead time is of the essence continue present course\nno change of plan has been ordered lieutenant our arrival at beta aurigae will merely be delayed our gravitational studies of that binary system will not suffer and a life may be saved that is not unusual procedure for the enterprise\nmister spock if you d concentrate on the areas for which you are responsible starfleet command would ve been informed already\ninform starfleet of the delay lieutenant\ncontinue present course increase speed to warp factor six\nwhy are you being so defensive theres no implied criticism of you in my order to remove you from the case\nthats the opinion of an individual\nthere are no administrative duties required here\npromotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred you know that bones\nim afraid the order will have to stand i can only say that doctor colemans experience with what happened on the planet had to be the deciding factor here im sure that you can appreciate that\nwhat what do you base that on\nyoull never make that charge stick any fool can see why your e doing this\ni wont submit to this petty search for revenge\ncaptain kirk here\nill be right there\nwell gentlemen im here doctor\nshe might have killed someone\nput her in isolation in her room maintain a twenty four hour watch no one absolutely no one is to talk to her without my permission\nhow ami otherwise\ngood i hope your e as pleased about it asia m\nyou said i was in perfect condition\ni dont think another test is necessary\nwell are you satisfied with the results of the tests\nno hard feelings bones you did your usual thorough good job\ncaptain kirk here\ncaptain kirk to security on the double to doctor lester s room\nphasers\nattention all personnel first officer spock has been placed under arrest he has conspired with doctor lester to take over the ship from your captain a hearing will be immediately convened to consider the charges and specifications of a general court martial on the charge of mutiny captains log stardate 59303 the results of doctor mccoys examination have given me complete confidence in myself my fears are past is hall function freely as the captain i am the captain of the enterprise in fact\nshes dangerously insane weve seen the evidence\nmister spock mister spock my authority has been given to me by starfleet command and only that high authority can take it away\nmister lem li have doctor janice lester brought here\ndoctor mccoy while mister spock was busy with his ambitious plot what were you doing\noh yes you were deeply concerned about my health emotional and physical since leaving camus two is that correct\ninstead of trying to destroy me you were searching for ways to help me doctor mccoy for the record will you tell the court your findings\nthank you doctor mccoy mister spock were you aware of doctor mccoys findings\nand what have you to say now\ndoctor coleman if youre required here well call you\nwe certainly appreciate your being here everyone is deeply aware that you have been subjected to inordinate emotional stress we had hoped to avoid any further stress but mister spock disagrees it is his opinion that your testimony is important in determining the merits of his case and since we are solely interested in arriving at a just decision im going to have to ask you a few more questions ill try not to upset you you claim that that you are captain james t kirk\noh well however asi understand it iam doctor janice lester\na subtlety that somehow escapes mei assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement\nviolence by the lady perpetrated on captain kirk i ask the assembled personnel to look at doctor janice lester and visualise that historic moment can you can you tell me why doctor janice lester would agree to this ludicrous exchange\nare you prepared with witnesses one will do\nmister spock have you ever heard of a case such as described by doctor janice lester\noh assuming that you are correct in your belief do you expect starfleet command to place this er this er person in command of the enterprise\nand with the truth revealed that i am not really the captain and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain then you would be the captain it is inevitable spock spock give it up return to the enterprise family all charges will be dropped and the madness that temporarily overcame all of us on camus two will fade and be forgotten\ndoctor lester will be cared for always it is a debt and a responsibility i owe her from the past\nlieutenant lysa playback those last two sentences from mister spock s tirade\nyou heard the statements placed into the record by you do you understand the nature of it\nit is mutiny deliberate vindictive insane at its base but mutiny is charged and encouragement to mutiny doctor mccoy mister scott you heard it on the basis of these statements i call for an immediate vote by the powers granted to me as captain of the enterprise a recess is declared to be followed by a vote\nsilence you will be silent a recess has been declared there will be no cross discussion when i return we will vote on the charge of mutiny the evidence presented here is the only basis of your decision\nplay the tapes of the conversation in the corridor\nenough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers and your e so charged the sentence death mister lem li\nall my senior officers turning against me\ni am responsible the execution will be immediate go to your posts go to your posts\nmister lem li take them to the brig prepare for execution go on\nlieutenant lysa inform all sectors of my decision have each section send a representative to the place of execution on the hangar deck mister chekov how far to the bene cia colony\nplot coordinates for orbit mister sulu lock into coordinates as soon as orbit is accomplished interment will take place on bene cia\nyou have received your orders you will obey my orders you ll be charged with mutiny you will obey my orders or or\narthur the transference is weakening\nfor a moment i found myself back with the prisoners i will not go back to being janice lester you must help me prevent it\ni cant i cant the crew is in mutiny you must kill her for me\nthen do it for yourself if kirk doesnt die well both be exposed as murderers does that give you any choice\nthe dosage should be doubly lethal\nto prevent further conspiracy you will be removed to separate cells if there s any resistance youll be given a sedative until you learn cooperation doctor lester will be first follow doctor coleman\nkill him kill him\ncan you do anything for her\ni didnt want to destroy her\nher life could have been as rich as any womans if only if only back to the

quiet her\nwe were too late jim theres nothing could be done\nnoi believe it was celeb ium however doctor coleman disagrees to be specific is essential because the treatment of celeb ium is quite\ndid you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone\nbeaming her up to the enterprise will be less harmful than waiting\nno not entirely we both agree its radiation doctor coleman isnt prepared to say what form of radiation\nits crucial\noh i didnt know you knew her that well\nwell you must have been very young at the time jim\ni didnt realise that is hall do everything in my power\njim what are you doing here\ntests with the ships equipment shows no signs of internal radiation damage doctor coleman\ndoctor lester could be suffering from a phaser stun as far as the symptoms i can detect jim\nyou cant do this on this ship my medical authority is final\ni wont allow it\nits not necessary jim cant you see shes coming around\na sedative is not wise at this time captain\nnurse chapel follow your instructions\nill let my record speak for me\nthat is not the reason im here im here because doctor colemans record states that he s incompetent\nno sir that is the opinion of starfleet command i checked with them doctor coleman was removed from his post as chief medical officer of his ship for administrative incompetence\nas well as flagrant medical blunders\nnot in starfleet headquarters captain and certainly not in the surgeon generals office\ni appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make i also find myself in that position now jim and im asking you to report for an examination\ndevelopment of emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes since returning from that planet\nill let starfleet command be the judge of my motives\nbut you will submit to starfleet regulations and they state that the ship surgeon will require full examination of any crewmember that he has doubts about including the captain\nthese tests should help me pinpoint the cause of jims illness\nyes well what worries me most is that jim seems completely unaware that something is wrong with him we ve got to make him realise that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin\none of us should be able to get to him i keep looking for an approach but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it doubly difficult\nyou know headquarters spock theyre only interested in results of specific tests so far all we have to offer are our opinions\nill use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary\nwell then so beit our responsibility is clear\nwell its worth a try why dont you try to get to doctor lester while i examine jim\njim\ncaptain\nthats enough thats enough your heart will last forever captain\nin the pink as usual liver kidney blood count metabolic rate everything even your glands functioning at their usual normal peak of efficiency\ndont get dressed yet\nphysically\nthe rob biani dermal optic is crucial it reveals the basic emotional structure you had one once before now i need another one to compare with that previous test there should be no change in your dermal optic reactions to the colour wavelengths over here captain over here captain\nnow lower your arms and open your eyes\nthere is no positive evidence of any disorder\nim sure everything s going to be all right\nexamining you\nyes thats correct\nthe captain is in the best of physical condition his emotional and mental state is comparable to the time that he assumed command of the enterprise\nscotty\nive been through this with spock hes not being scientific and neither are you\ndont you think i know that my tests show theres nothing wrong with the captain now thats the only fact starfleet s going to be interested in\ni dont know\nwe dont know that\nwere talking about mutiny scotty\nyes im ready for the vote\nwere talking about mutiny scotty\nthats enough we know what was said\nthen its possible the transference can be broken\nof course come with me\nmister scott sir\ndoctor lester is certainly a very lucky young person to have escaped\nsurely you must have more than that to go on\nyour evidence is completely subjective we have to have evidence that we can examine out in the open\ndoctor doctor ive seen the captain feverish sick drunk delirious terrified overjoyed boiling mad but up to now i have never seen him red faced with hysteria i know how im going to vote\nit may not be scientific but if mister spock thinks it happened then it must be logical\nheadquarters has its problems and we have ours and right now the captain of the enterprise is our problem theyre going to call for the vote in a few minutes let me put one last question suppose you vote with me in favour of spock that means two votes to one and spock is free what do you think the captain ll do\naye you know all right itll stick in his craw hell never accept it\ni tell you he wont then doctor thats the time we move against him well have to take over the ship\naye are you ready for the vote\nthe ns the time we move against him well have to take over the ship\naye are you ready for the vote\nthe bridge is where you belong\ncaptain tricorder picking up very faint life readings approximately seven hundred metres from here help will have to be immediate\ncaptain that will delay our work at beta aurigae it means reversing course\nmay i point out that starbase two is on the direct route to our destination\nif the diagnosis of doctor lester s illness is the critical problem then the bene cia colony is definitely not the place for her their medical facilities are the most primitive\nstarbase two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor is that not crucial to your decision\nat maximum speed starbase two would still meet the emergency\nsiri believe starfleet will have to be notified that our rendezvous with the starship potemkin will not take place as scheduled\nsince the captain usually deals with starfleet in these matters i assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference\ngood knowledge of the captains aberrant behaviour is spreading through the ship the crew is becoming increasingly tense\nim afraid that is a forlorn hope doctor the illness appears to be primarily mental\nperhaps the surgeon generals office should be alerted\nare you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind\ndoctor we are treading on very thin ground actions such as these might be misinterpreted\nwhatever happened to the captain on that planet must ve taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with doctor lester perhaps a conversation with her might shed some light\nhow is the doctor\ngood i have questions to ask her\nwhy should he they are my questions therefore i am ordering it lieutenant\nhas such an order ever included his senior officers\nby all means lieutenant\ncomplete life entity transfer with the aid of a mechanical device\nto my knowledge such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success anywhere in the galaxy\nthat is your claim as yet it is unsubstantiated by any external evidence or objective tests\nat this moment doctor mccoy is examining the captain for psychological changes if any facts are uncovered that would be acceptable evidence the only kind which is acceptable to starfleet command and to the crew of the enterprise\nthat is true the captain did not however those events have been recorded they could have become known to you\ni believe you however my belief is not acceptable evidence evidence must be factual doctor mccoy maybe of help come with me\nhe is not the captain\ncertainly lieutenant we all must do our duty\nits quite all right ensign everything is under control\na repetition of your physical violence is not called for sir no physical resistance will be offered\ni have stated my evidence telepathic communication with the mind of captain james t kirk\nyouve had great deal of evidence except that of the chief witness the one who should be the real subject of this investigation is kept locked away and in isolation why captain\nshe is dangerous only to your authority sir\nthe witness sir bring on the witness let your officers put the questions\ni know them now\ni am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no objective evidence to support my position so far\nsir there is only one issue here is the story of life entity transfer believable this crew has been to many places in the galaxy they ve been witness to many strange events they are trained to know that what seems to be impossible often is possible given the scientific analysis of the phenomenon\nnot precisely no\ni expect only to reveal the truth\nand what will become of doctor lester\nno siri shall not withdraw a single charge that i have made you are not captain kirk you have ruthlessly appropriated his body but the life entity within you is not that of captain kirk you do not belong in charge of the enterprise and is hall do everything in my power against you\nyou do not belong in charge of the enterprise and is hall do everything in my power against you\ni do and i standby it\nyes sir an immediate vote before our chief witness can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her\nperhaps you were\nto accomplish that each one of us must be ready to seize any opportunity to break out of here and attack\nmay i point out captain\nim sure we all understand that captain\nwarp factor two sir\naye sir three seven three mark eight\naye sir\nsulu here captain starfleet command is requesting additional details on the delay\nthe death penalty is forbidden theres only one exception\nthe captain really must be going mad if he thinks he can get away with an execution\nwhat difference does it make who he is are we going to allow an execution to take place\nill

indicate it doesnt become a cute for a month or so i estimates he has perhaps five or six weeks left\nthe older the victim the more rapid the progress of the disease\ni am a carrier whatever happens i
